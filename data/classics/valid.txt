<unk> of a rude mixture of sailors , soldiers , and those belonging to the <unk> <unk> of life , the present assembly was composed of the very flower of Marseilles society , — <unk> who had resigned their office during the usurper ’ s <unk> ; officers who had deserted from the <unk> army and joined forces with <unk> ; and younger members of families , brought up to hate and <unk> the man whom five years of <unk> would <unk> into a <unk> , and fifteen of <unk> <unk> to the rank of a <unk> .
The guests were still at table , and the <unk> and energetic conversation that prevailed betrayed the violent and <unk> passions that then agitated each <unk> of the South , where <unk> , for five centuries religious <unk> had long given increased bitterness to the violence of party feeling .
The emperor , now king of the petty Island of Elba , after having held sovereign <unk> over <unk> of the world , <unk> as his subjects a small <unk> of five or six thousand souls , — after having been accustomed to hear the “ _ <unk> <unk> _ ” of a hundred and twenty millions of human beings , uttered in ten different <unk> , — was looked upon here as a ruined man , separated forever from any fresh connection with France or claim to her throne .
The <unk> freely <unk> their political views ; the military part of the company talked <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , while the women <unk> on the <unk> of <unk> .
It was not over the <unk> of the man , but over the <unk> of the <unk> idea , that they rejoiced , and in this they <unk> for themselves the bright and <unk> prospect of a <unk> political existence .
An old man , <unk> with the cross of Saint Louis , now rose and proposed the health of King Louis XVIII .
It was the Marquis de Saint-Méran .
This <unk> , <unk> at once the patient <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> King of France , excited universal enthusiasm ; glasses were elevated in the air _ à l ’ <unk> _ , and the ladies , <unk> their <unk> from their fair <unk> , <unk> the table with their <unk> treasures .
In a word , an almost <unk> <unk> prevailed .
“ Ah , ” said the <unk> de Saint-Méran , a woman with a stern , <unk> eye , though still noble and distinguished in appearance , <unk> her fifty years — “ <unk> , these <unk> , who have driven us from those very <unk> they afterwards purchased for a mere trifle during the <unk> of <unk> , would be compelled to own , were they here , that all true devotion was on our side , since we were content to follow the <unk> of a falling <unk> , while they , on the contrary , made their fortune by <unk> the rising sun ; yes , yes , they could not help <unk> that the king , for whom we <unk> rank , wealth , and station was truly our ‘ Louis the <unk> , ’ while their wretched usurper has been , and ever will be , to them their evil genius , their ‘ Napoleon the <unk> . ’ Am I not right , Villefort ? ” “ I beg your pardon , madame .
I really must pray you to excuse me , but — in truth — I was not attending to the conversation . ” “ <unk> , marquise ! ” <unk> the old <unk> who had proposed the <unk> , “ let the young people alone ; let me tell you , on one ’ s wedding day there are more agreeable subjects of conversation than dry politics . ” “ Never mind , dearest mother , ” said a young and lovely girl , with a <unk> of light brown hair , and eyes that seemed to <unk> in <unk> <unk> , “ ’ <unk> all my fault for seizing upon M. de Villefort , so as to prevent his listening to what you said .
But there — now take him — he is your own for as long as you like .
M. Villefort , I beg to remind you my mother speaks to you . ” “ If the marquise will <unk> to repeat the words I but <unk> caught , I shall be delighted to answer , ” said M. de Villefort .
“ Never mind , Renée , ” replied the marquise , with a look of tenderness that seemed out of keeping with her harsh dry features ; but , however all other feelings may be <unk> in a woman ’ s nature , there is always one bright smiling spot in the desert of her heart , and that is the <unk> of <unk> love .
“ I forgive you .
What I was saying , Villefort , was , that the <unk> had not our sincerity , enthusiasm , or devotion . ” “ They had , however , what supplied the place of those fine qualities , ” replied the young man , “ and that was <unk> .
Napoleon is the <unk> of the <unk> , and is <unk> by his <unk> but <unk> <unk> , not only as a leader and <unk> , but also as the <unk> of <unk> . ” “ He ! ” cried the marquise : “ Napoleon the type of <unk> !
For mercy ’ s sake , then , what would you call <unk> ?
Come , come , do not <unk> the latter of his just rights to bestow them on the Corsican , who , to my mind , has <unk> quite enough . ” <unk> “ Nay , madame ; I would place each of these heroes on his right <unk> — that of <unk> on his scaffold in the Place Louis <unk> ; that of Napoleon on the column of the Place <unk> .
The only difference <unk> in the opposite character of the <unk> <unk> by these two men ; one is the <unk> that <unk> , the other is the <unk> that <unk> ; one brings a king within reach of the <unk> , the other <unk> the people to a level with the throne .
<unk> , ” said Villefort , smiling , “ I do not mean to deny that both these men were revolutionary <unk> , and that the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> of April , in the year <unk> , were lucky days for France , worthy of being <unk> remembered by every friend to monarchy and civil order ; and that <unk> how it comes to pass that , fallen , as I trust he is forever , Napoleon has still retained a train of <unk> <unk> .
Still , marquise , it has been so with other <unk> — <unk> , for instance , who was not half so bad as Napoleon , had his <unk> and <unk> . ” “ Do you know , Villefort , that you are talking in a most dreadfully revolutionary strain ?
But I excuse it , it is impossible to expect the son of a <unk> to be free from a small <unk> of the old <unk> . ” A deep <unk> <unk> the countenance of Villefort .
“ ’ Tis true , madame , ” answered he , “ that my father was a <unk> , but he was not among the number of those who <unk> for the king ’ s death ; he was an equal <unk> with yourself during the <unk> of <unk> , and had <unk> lost his head on the same scaffold on which your father <unk> . ” “ True , ” replied the marquise , without <unk> in the slightest degree at the tragic remembrance thus called up ; “ but bear in mind , if you please , that our <unk> parents <unk> <unk> and <unk> from <unk> opposite principles ; in proof of which I may remark , that while my family remained among the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , your father lost no time in <unk> the new government ; and that while the <unk> Noirtier was a <unk> , the Count Noirtier became a <unk> . ” “ Dear mother , ” <unk> Renée , “ you know very well it was agreed that all these disagreeable <unk> should forever be laid aside . ” “ <unk> me , also , madame , ” replied Villefort , “ to add my earnest request to Mademoiselle de Saint-Méran ’ s , that you will kindly allow the veil of <unk> to cover and conceal the past .
What <unk> <unk> over matters wholly past recall ?
For my own part , I have laid aside even the name of my father , and altogether <unk> his political principles .
He was — nay , probably may still be — a Bonapartist , and is called Noirtier ; I , on the contrary , am a <unk> <unk> , and style myself de Villefort .
Let what may remain of revolutionary <unk> <unk> itself and die away with the old <unk> , and <unk> only to regard the young <unk> which has started up at a distance from the <unk> tree , without having the power , any more than the wish , to separate entirely from the stock from which it sprung . ” “ <unk> , Villefort ! ” cried the marquis ; “ <unk> well said !
Come , now , I have hopes of obtaining what I have been for years endeavoring to persuade the marquise to promise ; <unk> , a perfect <unk> and forgetfulness of the past . ” “ With all my heart , ” replied the marquise ; “ let the past be forever forgotten .
I promise you it <unk> _ me _ as little pleasure to <unk> it as it does you .
All I ask is , that Villefort will be firm and <unk> for the future in his political principles .
Remember , also , Villefort , that we have <unk> ourselves to his majesty for your <unk> and strict <unk> , and that at our <unk> the king <unk> to forget the past , as I do ” ( and here she extended to him her hand ) — “ as I now do at your <unk> .
But bear in mind , that should there fall in your way anyone guilty of <unk> against the government , you will be so much the more bound to visit the offence with <unk> punishment , as it is known you belong to a suspected family . ” “ Alas , madame , ” returned Villefort , “ my profession , as well as the times in which we live , <unk> me to be severe .
I have already <unk> conducted several public <unk> , and brought the <unk> to <unk> punishment .
But we have not done with the thing yet . ” <unk> “ Do you , indeed , think so ? ” inquired the marquise .
“ I am , at least , fearful of it .
Napoleon , in the Island of Elba , is too near France , and his <unk> keeps up the hopes of his <unk> .
Marseilles is filled with <unk> officers , who are daily , under one <unk> pretext or other , getting up <unk> with the <unk> ; from hence arise continual and fatal <unk> among the higher <unk> of persons , and <unk> in the lower . ” “ You have heard , perhaps , ” said the Comte de <unk> , one of M. de Saint-Méran ’ s <unk> friends , and <unk> to the Comte d ’ <unk> , “ that the Holy <unk> purpose <unk> him from thence ? ” “ Yes ; they were talking about it when we left Paris , ” said M. de Saint-Méran ; “ and where is it decided to <unk> him ? ” “ To Saint <unk> . ” “ For heaven ’ s sake , where is that ? ” asked the marquise .
“ An island situated on the other side of the <unk> , at least two thousand leagues from here , ” replied the count .
“ So much the better .
As Villefort <unk> , it is a great act of folly to have left such a man between Corsica , where he was born , and Naples , of which his <unk> is king , and face to face with Italy , the <unk> of which he <unk> for his son . ” “ <unk> , ” said Villefort , “ there are the <unk> of <unk> , and we cannot <unk> Napoleon without breaking those <unk> . ” “ Oh , well , we shall find some way out of it , ” responded M. de <unk> .
“ There <unk> ’ t any trouble over <unk> when it was a question of <unk> the poor Duc d ’ <unk> . ” “ Well , ” said the marquise , “ it seems probable that , by the aid of the Holy <unk> , we shall be rid of Napoleon ; and we must trust to the <unk> of M. de Villefort to <unk> Marseilles of his <unk> .
The king is either a king or no king ; if he be acknowledged as sovereign of France , he should be <unk> in peace and tranquillity ; and this can best be effected by <unk> the most <unk> agents to put down every attempt at <unk> — ’ <unk> the best and <unk> means of <unk> mischief . ” “ <unk> , madame , ” answered Villefort , “ the strong arm of the law is not called upon to interfere until the evil has taken place . ” “ Then all he has got to do is to endeavor to <unk> it . ” “ Nay , madame , the law is frequently <unk> to effect this ; all it can do is to <unk> the wrong done . ” “ Oh , M. de Villefort , ” cried a beautiful young creature , daughter to the Comte de <unk> , and the cherished friend of Mademoiselle de Saint-Méran , “ do try and get up some famous trial while we are at Marseilles .
I never was in a <unk> ; I am told it is so very amusing ! ” “ <unk> , certainly , ” replied the young man , “ <unk> as , instead of <unk> tears as at the <unk> tale of <unk> produced at a theatre , you behold in a <unk> a case of real and genuine distress — a drama of life .
The prisoner whom you there see pale , agitated , and alarmed , instead of — as is the case when a curtain falls on a tragedy — going home to <unk> <unk> with his family , and then <unk> to rest , that he may <unk> his <unk> <unk> on the morrow , — is removed from your sight merely to be <unk> to his prison and delivered up to the executioner .
I leave you to judge how far your nerves are calculated to bear you through such a scene .
Of this , however , be assured , that should any favorable opportunity present itself , I will not fail to offer you the choice of being present . ” “ For shame , M. de Villefort ! ” said Renée , becoming quite pale ; “ don ’ t you see how you are <unk> us ? — and yet you laugh . ” “ What would you have ?
’ Tis like a duel .
I have already <unk> sentence of death , five or six times , against the <unk> of political <unk> , and who can say how many <unk> may be ready <unk> , and only waiting a favorable opportunity to be buried in my heart ? ” “ <unk> heavens , M. de Villefort , ” said Renée , becoming more and more terrified ; “ you surely are not in earnest . ” “ Indeed I am , ” replied the young magistrate with a smile ; “ and in the interesting trial that young lady is anxious to witness , the case would only be still more <unk> .
<unk> , for instance , the prisoner , as is more than probable , to have served under Napoleon — well , can you expect for an instant , that one accustomed , at the word of his <unk> , to rush <unk> on the very bayonets of his <unk> , will scruple more to drive a <unk> into the heart of one he knows to be his personal enemy , than to <unk> his <unk> , merely because <unk> to do so by one he is bound to obey ?
Besides , one requires the excitement of being <unk> in the eyes of the accused , in order to <unk> one ’ s self into a state of sufficient <unk> and power .
I would not choose to see the man against whom I <unk> smile , as though in <unk> of my words .
No ; my pride is to see the accused pale , agitated , and as though beaten out of all composure by the fire of my <unk> . ” Renée uttered a <unk> exclamation .
“ <unk> ! ” cried one of the guests ; “ that is what I call talking to some purpose . ” “ Just the person we require at a time like the present , ” said a second .
“ What a splendid business that last case of yours was , my dear Villefort ! ” remarked a third ; “ I mean the trial of the man for <unk> his father .
Upon my word , you killed him ere the executioner had laid his hand upon him . ” “ Oh , as for <unk> , and such dreadful people as that , ” <unk> Renée , “ it matters very little what is done to them ; but as <unk> poor unfortunate creatures whose only crime <unk> in having mixed themselves up in political <unk> — — ” “ Why , that is the very worst offence they could possibly commit ; for , don ’ t you see , Renée , the king is the father of his people , and he who shall plot or <unk> <unk> against the life and safety of the <unk> of <unk> millions of souls , is a <unk> upon a <unk> great scale ? ” “ I don ’ t know anything about that , ” replied Renée ; “ but , M. de Villefort , you have promised me — have you not ? — always to show mercy to those I <unk> for . ” “ Make yourself quite easy on that point , ” answered Villefort , with one of his <unk> smiles ; “ you and I will always consult upon our <unk> . ” “ My love , ” said the marquise , “ attend to your <unk> , your <unk> , and <unk> , but do not <unk> with what you do not understand .
<unk> the military profession is in <unk> and the <unk> <unk> is the <unk> of honor .
There is a wise Latin <unk> that is very much in point . ” “ _ <unk> <unk> <unk> _ , ” said Villefort with a bow .
“ I cannot speak Latin , ” responded the marquise .
“ Well , ” said Renée , “ I cannot help <unk> you had not chosen some other profession than your own — a physician , for instance .
Do you know I always felt a shudder at the idea of even a _ <unk> _ angel ? ” “ Dear , good Renée , ” whispered Villefort , as he gazed with <unk> tenderness on the lovely <unk> .
“ Let us hope , my child , ” cried the marquis , “ that M. de Villefort may prove the moral and political physician of this <unk> ; if so , he will have <unk> a noble work . ” “ And one which will go far to <unk> the recollection of his father ’ s conduct , ” added the <unk> marquise .
“ Madame , ” replied Villefort , with a mournful smile , “ I have already had the honor to observe that my father has — at least , I hope so — <unk> his past errors , and that he is , at the present moment , a firm and <unk> friend to religion and order — a better <unk> , possibly , than his son ; for he has to <unk> for past <unk> , while I have no other impulse than warm , decided preference and conviction . ” Having made this <unk> speech , Villefort looked carefully around to mark the effect of his <unk> , much as he would have done had he been addressing the bench in open court .
“ Do you know , my dear Villefort , ” cried the Comte de <unk> , “ that is exactly what I myself said the other day at the Tuileries , when questioned by his majesty ’ s principal <unk> touching the <unk> of an alliance between the son of a <unk> and the daughter of an officer of the Duc de <unk> ; and I assure you he seemed fully to comprehend that this mode of <unk> political <unk> was <unk> upon sound and excellent principles .
Then the king , who , without our <unk> it , had <unk> our conversation , interrupted us by saying , ‘ Villefort ’ — observe that the king did not pronounce the word Noirtier , but , on the contrary , placed considerable <unk> on that of Villefort — ‘ Villefort , ’ said his majesty , ‘ is a young man of great judgment and <unk> , who will be sure to make a figure in his profession ; I like him much , and it gave me great pleasure to hear that he was about to become the <unk> of the Marquis and <unk> de Saint-Méran .
I should myself have recommended the match , had not the noble marquis anticipated my wishes by <unk> my consent to it . ’ ” “ Is it possible the king could have <unk> so far as to express himself so <unk> of me ? ” asked the <unk> Villefort .
“ I give you his very words ; and if the marquis <unk> to be <unk> , he will confess that they perfectly agree with what his majesty said to him , when he went six months ago to consult him upon the subject of your <unk> his daughter . ” <unk> “ That is true , ” answered the marquis .
“ How much do I owe this gracious prince !
What is there I would not do to <unk> my earnest gratitude ! ” “ That is right , ” cried the marquise .
“ I love to see you thus .
Now , then , were a <unk> to fall into your hands , he would be most welcome . ” “ For my part , dear mother , ” <unk> Renée , “ I trust your wishes will not <unk> , and that Providence will only permit petty <unk> , poor <unk> , and miserable <unk> to fall into M. de Villefort ’ s hands , — then I shall be contented . ” “ Just the same as though you <unk> that a physician might only be called upon to <unk> for <unk> , <unk> , and the <unk> of <unk> , or any other slight affection of the <unk> .
If you wish to see me the king ’ s attorney , you must desire for me some of those violent and dangerous <unk> from the cure of which so much honor <unk> to the physician . ” At this moment , and as though the utterance of Villefort ’ s wish had sufficed to effect its <unk> , a servant entered the room , and whispered a few words in his ear .
Villefort immediately rose from table and quitted the room upon the <unk> of <unk> business ; he soon , however , returned , his whole face <unk> with delight .
Renée regarded him with fond affection ; and certainly his handsome features , lit up as they then were with more than usual fire and animation , seemed formed to excite the innocent admiration with which she gazed on her graceful and intelligent lover .
“ You were wishing just now , ” said Villefort , addressing her , “ that I were a doctor instead of a lawyer .
Well , I at least resemble the <unk> of <unk> in one thing &#91; people spoke in this style in 1815 &#93; , that of not being able to call a day my own , not even that of my <unk> . ” “ And <unk> were you called away just now ? ” asked Mademoiselle de Saint-Méran , with an air of deep interest .
“ For a very serious matter , which <unk> fair to make work for the executioner . ” “ How dreadful ! ” exclaimed Renée , turning pale .
“ Is it possible ? ” burst <unk> from all who were near enough to the magistrate to hear his words .
“ Why , if my information prove correct , a sort of Bonapartist <unk> has just been discovered . ” “ Can I believe my ears ? ” cried the marquise .
“ I will read you the letter containing the accusation , at least , ” said Villefort : “ ‘ The king ’ s attorney is informed by a friend to the throne and the religious <unk> of his country , that one named Edmond Dantès , mate of the ship _ Pharaon _ , this day arrived from <unk> , after having touched at Naples and <unk> , has been the <unk> of a letter from <unk> to the usurper , and again taken charge of another letter from the usurper to the Bonapartist club in Paris .
<unk> <unk> of this statement may be obtained by <unk> the <unk> Edmond Dantès , who either <unk> the letter for Paris about with him , or has it at his father ’ s abode .
Should it not be found in the possession of father or son , then it will assuredly be discovered in the <unk> belonging to the said Dantès on board the _ Pharaon _ . ’ ” “ But , ” said Renée , “ this letter , which , after all , is but an <unk> <unk> , is not even addressed to you , but to the king ’ s attorney . ” <unk> “ True ; but that gentleman being absent , his secretary , by his orders , opened his letters ; thinking this one of importance , he sent for me , but not finding me , took upon himself to give the necessary orders for <unk> the accused party . ” “ Then the guilty person is absolutely in <unk> ? ” said the marquise .
“ Nay , dear mother , say the accused person .
You know we cannot yet pronounce him guilty . ” “ He is in safe <unk> , ” answered Villefort ; “ and rely upon it , if the letter is found , he will not be likely to be trusted abroad again , unless he goes forth under the <unk> protection of the <unk> . ” “ And where is the unfortunate being ? ” asked Renée .
“ He is at my house . ” “ Come , come , my friend , ” interrupted the marquise , “ do not neglect your duty to <unk> with us .
You are the king ’ s servant , and must go wherever that service calls you . ” “ Oh , Villefort ! ” cried Renée , <unk> her hands , and looking towards her lover with <unk> <unk> , “ be <unk> on this the day of our <unk> . ” The young man passed round to the side of the table where the fair <unk> sat , and leaning over her chair said tenderly : “ To give you pleasure , my sweet Renée , I promise to show all the <unk> in my power ; but if the <unk> brought against this Bonapartist hero prove correct , why , then , you really must give me leave to order his head to be cut off . ” Renée shuddered at the word _ cut _ , for the growth in question had a head .
“ Never mind that foolish girl , Villefort , ” said the marquise .
“ She will soon get over these things . ” So saying , Madame de Saint-Méran extended her dry <unk> hand to Villefort , who , while <unk> a <unk> ’ s respectful salute on it , looked at Renée , as much as to say , “ I must try and fancy ’ <unk> your dear hand I kiss , as it should have been . ” “ These are mournful <unk> to accompany a <unk> , ” sighed poor Renée .
“ Upon my word , child ! ” exclaimed the angry marquise , “ your folly <unk> all bounds .
I should be glad to know what connection there can possibly be between your <unk> <unk> and the affairs of the state ! ” “ Oh , mother ! ” murmured Renée .
“ Nay , madame , I pray you pardon this little <unk> .
I promise you that to make up for her want of <unk> , I will be most <unk> severe ; ” then casting an expressive glance at his betrothed , which seemed to say , “ <unk> not , for your dear sake my justice shall be <unk> with mercy , ” and receiving a sweet and <unk> smile in return , Villefort departed with paradise in his heart .
Chapter 7 .
The <unk> No sooner had Villefort left the salon , than he assumed the grave air of a man who holds the balance of life and death in his hands .
Now , in spite of the nobility of his countenance , the command of which , like a finished <unk> , he had carefully studied before the glass , it was by no means easy for him to assume an air of <unk> severity .
Except the recollection of the line of politics his father had adopted , and which might interfere , unless he acted with the greatest prudence , with his own career , <unk> de Villefort was as happy as a man could be .
<unk> rich , he held a high official situation , though only <unk> .
He was about to marry a young and charming woman , whom he loved , not <unk> , but <unk> , as became a deputy attorney of the king ; and besides her personal <unk> , which were very great , Mademoiselle de Saint-Méran ’ s family possessed considerable political influence , which they would , of course , <unk> in his favor .
The <unk> of his wife <unk> to fifty thousand crowns , and he had , besides , the prospect of seeing her fortune increased to half a million at her father ’ s death .
These <unk> naturally gave Villefort a feeling of such complete felicity that his mind was fairly dazzled in its contemplation .
At the door he met the <unk> of police , who was waiting for him .
The sight of this officer recalled Villefort from the third heaven to earth ; he composed his face , as we have before described , and said , “ I have read the letter , sir , and you have acted rightly in <unk> this man ; now inform me what you have discovered concerning him and the <unk> . ” “ We know nothing as yet of the <unk> , monsieur ; all the papers found have been sealed up and placed on your desk .
The prisoner himself is named Edmond Dantès , mate on board the <unk> the _ Pharaon _ , <unk> in <unk> with <unk> and <unk> , and belonging to Morrel &amp; <unk> , of Marseilles . ” “ Before he entered the merchant service , had he ever served in the <unk> ? ” “ Oh , no , monsieur , he is very young . ” “ How old ? ” “ <unk> or twenty at the most . ” At this moment , and as Villefort had arrived at the corner of the Rue des <unk> , a man , who seemed to have been waiting for him , approached ; it was M. Morrel .
“ Ah , M. de Villefort , ” cried he , “ I am delighted to see you .
Some of your people have committed the <unk> mistake — they have just arrested Edmond Dantès , mate of my vessel . ” “ I know it , monsieur , ” replied Villefort , “ and I am now going to examine him . ” “ Oh , ” said Morrel , carried away by his friendship , “ you do not know him , and I do .
He is the most <unk> , the most <unk> creature in the world , and I will venture to say , there is not a better <unk> in all the merchant service .
Oh , M. de Villefort , I <unk> your indulgence for him . ” Villefort , as we have seen , belonged to the <unk> party at Marseilles , Morrel to the <unk> ; the first was a <unk> , the other suspected of <unk> .
Villefort looked <unk> at Morrel , and replied coldly : “ You are aware , monsieur , that a man may be <unk> and <unk> in private life , and the best <unk> in the merchant service , and yet be , <unk> speaking , a great criminal .
Is it not true ? ” The magistrate laid <unk> on these words , as if he wished to apply them to the owner himself , while his eyes seemed to <unk> into the heart of one who , <unk> for another , had himself need of indulgence .
Morrel <unk> , for his own conscience was not quite clear on politics ; besides , what Dantès had told him of his interview with the <unk> , and what the emperor had said to him , embarrassed him .
He replied , however , in a tone of deep interest : “ I entreat you , M. de Villefort , be , as you always are , kind and <unk> , and give him back to us soon . ” This _ give us _ sounded revolutionary in the deputy ’ s ears .
“ Ah , <unk> , ” murmured he , “ is Dantès then a member of some <unk> society , that his protector thus <unk> the <unk> form ?
He was , if I recollect , arrested in a tavern , in company with a great many others . ” Then he added , “ Monsieur , you may rest assured I shall perform my duty <unk> , and that if he be innocent you shall not have <unk> to me in vain ; should he , however , be guilty , in this present epoch , <unk> would furnish a dangerous example , and I must do my duty . ” <unk> As he had now arrived at the door of his own house , which <unk> the <unk> de <unk> , he entered , after having , coldly <unk> the <unk> , who stood , as if petrified , on the spot where Villefort had left him .
The antechamber was full of police agents and gendarmes , in the midst of whom , carefully watched , but calm and smiling , stood the prisoner .
Villefort traversed the antechamber , cast a side glance at Dantès , and taking a packet which a gendarme offered him , disappeared , saying , “ <unk> in the prisoner . ” <unk> as had been Villefort ’ s glance , it had served to give him an idea of the man he was about to <unk> .
He had recognized intelligence in the high forehead , courage in the dark eye and bent brow , and <unk> in the thick lips that showed a set of <unk> teeth .
Villefort ’ s first impression was favorable ; but he had been so often warned to <unk> first <unk> , that he applied the <unk> to the impression , forgetting the difference between the two words .
He stifled , therefore , the feelings of compassion that were rising , composed his features , and sat down , grim and sombre , at his desk .
An instant after Dantès entered .
He was pale , but calm and collected , and <unk> his judge with easy politeness , looked round for a seat , as if he had been in M. Morrel ’ s salon .
It was then that he encountered for the first time Villefort ’ s look , — that look peculiar to the magistrate , who , while seeming to read the thoughts of others , <unk> nothing of his own .
“ Who and what are you ? ” demanded Villefort , turning over a pile of papers , containing information relative to the prisoner , that a police agent had given to him on his entry , and that , already , in an hour ’ s time , had <unk> to <unk> <unk> , thanks to the <unk> <unk> of which “ the accused ” is always made the victim .
“ My name is Edmond Dantès , ” replied the young man calmly ; “ I am mate of the _ Pharaon _ , belonging to <unk> Morrel &amp; <unk> . ” “ Your age ? ” continued Villefort .
“ <unk> , ” returned Dantès .
“ What were you doing at the moment you were arrested ? ” “ I was at the festival of my marriage , monsieur , ” said the young man , his voice slightly <unk> , so great was the contrast between that happy moment and the painful ceremony he was now <unk> ; so great was the contrast between the sombre aspect of M. de Villefort and the radiant face of Mercédès .
“ You were at the festival of your marriage ? ” said the deputy , shuddering in spite of himself .
“ Yes , monsieur ; I am on the point of marrying a young girl I have been attached to for three years . ” Villefort , <unk> as he was , was struck with this <unk> ; and the <unk> voice of Dantès , surprised in the midst of his happiness , struck a <unk> <unk> in his own bosom — he also was on the point of being married , and he was summoned from his own happiness to destroy that of another .
“ This <unk> reflection , ” thought he , “ will make a great sensation at M. de Saint-Méran ’ s ; ” and he arranged <unk> , while Dantès awaited further questions , the <unk> by which <unk> often create a reputation for <unk> .
When this speech was arranged , Villefort turned to Dantès .
<unk> “ Go on , sir , ” said he .
“ What would you have me say ? ” “ Give all the information in your power . ” “ Tell me on which point you desire information , and I will tell all I know ; only , ” added he , with a smile , “ I warn you I know very little . ” “ Have you served under the usurper ? ” “ I was about to be <unk> into the <unk> <unk> when he fell . ” “ It is reported your political opinions are extreme , ” said Villefort , who had never heard anything of the kind , but was not sorry to make this inquiry , as if it were an accusation .
“ My political opinions ! ” replied Dantès .
“ Alas , sir , I never had any opinions .
I am hardly nineteen ; I know nothing ; I have no part to play .
If I obtain the situation I desire , I shall owe it to M. Morrel .
Thus all my opinions — I will not say public , but private — are confined to these three sentiments , — I love my father , I respect M. Morrel , and I adore Mercédès .
This , sir , is all I can tell you , and you see how <unk> it is . ” As Dantès spoke , Villefort gazed at his <unk> and open countenance , and recollected the words of Renée , who , without knowing who the <unk> was , had <unk> his indulgence for him .
With the deputy ’ s knowledge of crime and <unk> , every word the young man uttered convinced him more and more of his innocence .
This lad , for he was scarcely a man , — simple , natural , <unk> with that <unk> of the heart never found when sought for ; full of affection for everybody , because he was happy , and because happiness renders even the wicked good — extended his affection even to his judge , spite of Villefort ’ s severe look and stern accent .
Dantès seemed full of kindness .
_ “ <unk> ! ” _ said Villefort , “ he is a noble fellow .
I hope I shall gain Renée ’ s favor easily by <unk> the first command she ever imposed on me .
I shall have at least a pressure of the hand in public , and a sweet kiss in private . ” <unk> of this idea , Villefort ’ s face became so joyous , that when he turned to Dantès , the latter , who had watched the change on his physiognomy , was smiling also .
“ Sir , ” said Villefort , “ have you any enemies , at least , that you know . ” “ I have enemies ? ” replied Dantès ; “ my position is not sufficiently elevated for that .
As for my disposition , that is , perhaps , somewhat too hasty ; but I have <unk> to <unk> it .
I have had ten or twelve sailors under me , and if you question them , they will tell you that they love and respect me , not as a father , for I am too young , but as an elder brother . ” “ But you may have excited jealousy .
You are about to become captain at nineteen — an elevated post ; you are about to marry a pretty girl , who loves you ; and these two pieces of good fortune may have excited the envy of someone . ” “ You are right ; you know men better than I do , and what you say may possibly be the case , I confess ; but if such persons are among my <unk> I prefer not to know it , because then I should be forced to hate them . ” “ You are wrong ; you should always <unk> to see clearly around you .
You seem a worthy young man ; I will depart from the strict line of my duty to aid you in <unk> the author of this accusation .
Here is the paper ; do you know the writing ? ” As he spoke , Villefort drew the letter from his pocket , and presented it to Dantès .
Dantès read it .
A cloud passed over his brow as he said : “ No , monsieur , I do not know the writing , and yet it is tolerably plain .
<unk> did it writes well .
I am very fortunate , ” added he , looking <unk> at Villefort , “ to be examined by such a man as you ; for this <unk> person is a real enemy . ” And by the rapid glance that the young man ’ s eyes shot forth , Villefort saw how much energy lay hid beneath this <unk> .
“ Now , ” said the deputy , “ answer me <unk> , not as a prisoner to a judge , but as one man to another who takes an interest in him , what truth is there in the accusation contained in this <unk> letter ? ” And Villefort threw <unk> on his desk the letter Dantès had just given back to him .
“ None at all .
I will tell you the real facts .
I swear by my honor as a sailor , by my love for Mercédès , by the life of my father — — ” “ Speak , monsieur , ” said Villefort .
Then , <unk> , “ If Renée could see me , I hope she would be satisfied , and would no longer call me a <unk> . ” “ Well , when we quitted Naples , Captain <unk> was attacked with a brain fever .
As we had no doctor on board , and he was so anxious to arrive at Elba , that he would not touch at any other port , his disorder rose to such a height , that at the end of the third day , feeling he was dying , he called me to him .
‘ My dear Dantès , ’ said he , ‘ swear to perform what I am going to tell you , for it is a matter of the <unk> importance . ’ “ ‘ I swear , captain , ’ replied I.
“ ‘ Well , as after my death the command <unk> on you as mate , assume the command , and bear up for the Island of Elba , <unk> at <unk> , ask for the <unk> , give him this letter — perhaps they will give you another letter , and charge you with a commission .
You will accomplish what I was to have done , and <unk> all the honor and profit from it . ’ “ ‘ I will do it , captain ; but perhaps I shall not be admitted to the <unk> ’ s presence as easily as you expect ? ’ “ ‘ Here is a ring that will obtain audience of him , and remove every difficulty , ’ said the captain .
At these words he gave me a ring .
It was time — two hours after he was <unk> ; the next day he died . ” “ And what did you do then ? ” “ What I ought to have done , and what everyone would have done in my place .
<unk> the last <unk> of a dying man are sacred ; but with a sailor the last <unk> of his superior are <unk> .
I <unk> for the Island of Elba , where I arrived the next day ; I ordered everybody to remain on board , and went on shore alone .
As I had expected , I found some difficulty in obtaining access to the <unk> ; but I sent the ring I had received from the captain to him , and was instantly admitted .
He questioned me concerning Captain <unk> ’ s death ; and , as the latter had told me , gave me a letter to carry on to a person in Paris .
I <unk> it because it was what my captain had bade me do .
I landed here , <unk> the affairs of the vessel , and hastened to visit my <unk> bride , whom I found more lovely than ever .
Thanks to M. Morrel , all the forms were got over ; in a word I was , as I told you , at my marriage feast ; and I should have been married in an hour , and tomorrow I intended to start for Paris , had I not been arrested on this charge which you as well as I now see to be unjust . ” “ Ah , ” said Villefort , “ this seems to me the truth .
If you have been <unk> , it was <unk> , and this <unk> was in obedience to the orders of your captain .
Give up this letter you have brought from Elba , and pass your word you will appear should you be required , and go and <unk> your friends .
“ I am free , then , sir ? ” cried Dantès <unk> .
“ Yes ; but first give me this letter . ” “ You have it already , for it was taken from me with some others which I see in that packet . ” “ Stop a moment , ” said the deputy , as Dantès took his hat and gloves .
“ To whom is it addressed ? ” _ “ To Monsieur Noirtier , Rue <unk> , Paris . ” _ Had a <unk> fallen into the room , Villefort could not have been more stupefied .
He sank into his seat , and hastily turning over the packet , drew forth the fatal letter , at which he glanced with an expression of terror .
“ M.
Noirtier , Rue <unk> , No .
<unk> , ” murmured he , growing still <unk> .
“ Yes , ” said Dantès ; “ do you know him ? ” “ No , ” replied Villefort ; “ a faithful servant of the king does not know <unk> . ” <unk> “ It is a <unk> , then ? ” asked Dantès , who after believing himself free , now began to feel a <unk> alarm .
“ I have , however , already told you , sir , I was entirely ignorant of the contents of the letter . ” “ Yes ; but you knew the name of the person to whom it was addressed , ” said Villefort .
“ I was forced to read the address to know to whom to give it . ” “ Have you shown this letter to anyone ? ” asked Villefort , becoming still more pale .
“ To no one , on my honor . ” “ <unk> is ignorant that you are the <unk> of a letter from the Island of Elba , and addressed to M. Noirtier ? ” “ <unk> , except the person who gave it to me . ” “ And that was too much , far too much , ” murmured Villefort .
Villefort ’ s brow <unk> more and more , his white lips and clenched teeth filled Dantès with apprehension .
After reading the letter , Villefort covered his face with his hands .
“ Oh , ” said Dantès <unk> , “ what is the matter ? ” Villefort made no answer , but raised his head at the expiration of a few seconds , and again <unk> the letter .
“ And you say that you are ignorant of the contents of this letter ? ” “ I give you my word of honor , sir , ” said Dantès ; “ but what is the matter ?
You are ill — shall I ring for assistance ? — shall I call ? ” “ No , ” said Villefort , rising hastily ; “ stay where you are .
It is for me to give orders here , and not you . ” “ Monsieur , ” replied Dantès <unk> , “ it was only to summon assistance for you . ” “ I want none ; it was a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> to yourself ; answer me . ” Dantès waited , expecting a question , but in vain .
Villefort fell back on his chair , passed his hand over his brow , <unk> with perspiration , and , for the third time , read the letter .
“ Oh , if he knows the contents of this ! ” murmured he , “ and that Noirtier is the father of Villefort , I am lost ! ” And he fixed his eyes upon Edmond as if he would have penetrated his thoughts .
“ Oh , it is impossible to doubt it , ” cried he , suddenly .
“ In heaven ’ s name ! ” cried the unhappy young man , “ if you doubt me , question me ; I will answer you . ” Villefort made a violent effort , and in a tone he strove to render firm : “ Sir , ” said he , “ I am no longer able , as I had hoped , to restore you immediately to liberty ; before doing so , I must consult the trial justice ; what my own feeling is you already know . ” “ Oh , monsieur , ” cried Dantès , “ you have been rather a friend than a judge . ” <unk> “ Well , I must <unk> you some time longer , but I will <unk> to make it as short as possible .
The principal charge against you is this letter , and you see — — ” Villefort approached the fire , cast it in , and waited until it was entirely <unk> .
“ You see , I destroy it ? ” “ Oh , ” exclaimed Dantès , “ you are goodness itself . ” “ Listen , ” continued Villefort ; “ you can now have confidence in me after what I have done . ” “ Oh , command , and I will obey . ” “ Listen ; this is not a command , but advice I give you . ” “ Speak , and I will follow your advice . ” “ I shall <unk> you until this evening in the <unk> de <unk> .
Should anyone else <unk> you , say to him what you have said to me , but do not breathe a word of this letter . ” “ I promise . ” It was Villefort who seemed to entreat , and the prisoner who reassured him .
“ You see , ” continued he , glancing toward the <unk> , where <unk> of burnt paper <unk> in the flames , “ the letter is destroyed ; you and I alone know of its existence ; should you , therefore , be questioned , deny all knowledge of it — deny it <unk> , and you are saved . ” “ Be satisfied ; I will deny it . ” “ It was the only letter you had ? ” “ It was . ” “ <unk> it . ” “ I swear it . ” Villefort rang .
A police agent entered .
Villefort whispered some words in his ear , to which the officer replied by a motion of his head .
“ <unk> him , ” said Villefort to Dantès .
Dantès <unk> Villefort and retired .
<unk> had the door closed when Villefort threw himself <unk> into a chair .
“ Alas , alas , ” murmured he , “ if the procureur himself had been at Marseilles I should have been ruined .
This <unk> letter would have destroyed all my hopes .
Oh , my father , must your past career always interfere with my <unk> ? ” Suddenly a light passed over his face , a smile played round his set mouth , and his haggard eyes were fixed in thought .
“ This will do , ” said he , “ and from this letter , which might have ruined me , I will make my fortune .
Now to the work I have in hand . ” And after having assured himself that the prisoner was gone , the deputy procureur hastened to the house of his betrothed .
<unk> Chapter <unk> .
The Château d ’ If The <unk> of police , as he traversed the antechamber , made a sign to two gendarmes , who placed themselves one on Dantès ’ right and the other on his left .
A door that communicated with the <unk> de <unk> was opened , and they went through a long <unk> of gloomy <unk> , whose appearance might have made even the <unk> shudder .
The <unk> de <unk> communicated with the prison , — a sombre <unk> , that from its grated windows looks on the <unk> of the <unk> .
After <unk> <unk> , Dantès saw a door with an iron <unk> .
The <unk> took up an iron <unk> and knocked <unk> , every blow seeming to Dantès as if struck on his heart .
The door opened , the two gendarmes gently pushed him forward , and the door closed with a loud sound behind him .
The air he <unk> was no longer pure , but thick and <unk> , — he was in prison .
He was conducted to a tolerably <unk> chamber , but grated and barred , and its appearance , therefore , did not greatly alarm him ; besides , the words of Villefort , who seemed to interest himself so much , <unk> still in his ears like a promise of freedom .
It was four o ’ clock when Dantès was placed in this chamber .
It was , as we have said , the <unk> of March , and the prisoner was soon buried in darkness .
The obscurity augmented the <unk> of his hearing ; at the slightest sound he rose and hastened to the door , convinced they were about to <unk> him , but the sound died away , and Dantès sank again into his seat .
At last , about ten o ’ clock , and just as Dantès began to despair , steps were heard in the corridor , a key turned in the lock , the bolts <unk> , the <unk> <unk> door flew open , and a <unk> of light from two <unk> <unk> the apartment .
By the <unk> Dantès saw the <unk> <unk> and <unk> of four gendarmes .
He had advanced at first , but stopped at the sight of this display of force .
“ Are you come to fetch me ? ” asked he .
“ Yes , ” replied a gendarme .
“ By the orders of the deputy procureur ? ” “ I believe so . ” The conviction that they came from M. de Villefort relieved all Dantès ’ <unk> ; he advanced calmly , and placed himself in the centre of the <unk> .
A carriage waited at the door , the coachman was on the box , and a police officer sat beside him .
“ Is this carriage for me ? ” said Dantès .
“ It is for you , ” replied a gendarme .
Dantès was about to speak ; but feeling himself urged forward , and having neither the power nor the intention to resist , he mounted the steps , and was in an instant seated inside between two gendarmes ; the two others took their places opposite , and the carriage rolled heavily over the stones .
The prisoner glanced at the windows — they were grated ; he had changed his prison for another that was <unk> him he knew not whither .
Through the grating , however , Dantès saw they were passing through the Rue <unk> , and by the Rue <unk> and the Rue <unk> , to the quay .
Soon he saw the lights of La <unk> .
The carriage stopped , the officer descended , approached the <unk> , a dozen soldiers came out and formed themselves in order ; Dantès saw the reflection of their <unk> by the light of the lamps on the quay .
“ Can all this force be summoned on my account ? ” thought he .
The officer opened the door , which was locked , and , without speaking a word , answered Dantès ’ question ; for he saw between the ranks of the soldiers a passage formed from the carriage to the port .
The two gendarmes who were opposite to him descended first , then he was ordered to <unk> and the gendarmes on each side of him followed his example .
They advanced towards a boat , which a <unk> officer held by a chain , near the quay .
The soldiers looked at Dantès with an air of stupid curiosity .
In an instant he was placed in the <unk> of the boat , between the gendarmes , while the officer stationed himself at the bow ; a <unk> sent the boat <unk> , and four <unk> <unk> <unk> it rapidly towards the <unk> .
At a shout from the boat , the chain that <unk> the mouth of the port was lowered and in a second they were , as Dantès knew , in the <unk> and outside the inner <unk> .
The prisoner ’ s first feeling was of joy at again breathing the pure air — for air is freedom ; but he soon sighed , for he passed before La <unk> , where he had that morning been so happy , and now through the open windows came the laughter and <unk> of a ball .
Dantès folded his hands , raised his eyes to heaven , and <unk> <unk> .
<unk> The boat continued her voyage .
They had passed the <unk> de <unk> , were now off the <unk> du <unk> , and about to double the <unk> .
This <unk> was <unk> to Dantès .
“ <unk> are you taking me ? ” asked he .
“ You will soon know . ” “ But still — — ” “ We are forbidden to give you any explanation . ” Dantès , <unk> in <unk> , knew that nothing would be more absurd than to question <unk> , who were forbidden to reply ; and so he remained silent .
The most vague and wild thoughts passed through his mind .
The boat they were in could not make a long voyage ; there was no vessel at anchor outside the <unk> ; he thought , perhaps , they were going to leave him on some distant point .
He was not bound , nor had they made any attempt to <unk> him ; this seemed a good <unk> .
Besides , had not the deputy , who had been so kind to him , told him that provided he did not pronounce the dreaded name of Noirtier , he had nothing to <unk> ?
Had not Villefort in his presence destroyed the fatal letter , the only proof against him ?
He waited silently , <unk> to <unk> through the darkness .
They had left the <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> stood , on the right , and were now opposite the <unk> des Catalans .
It seemed to the prisoner that he could distinguish a <unk> form on the <unk> , for it was there Mercédès dwelt .
How was it that a <unk> did not warn Mercédès that her lover was within three hundred <unk> of her ?
One light alone was visible ; and Dantès saw that it came from Mercédès ’ chamber .
Mercédès was the only one awake in the whole <unk> .
A loud cry could be heard by her .
But pride restrained him and he did not utter it .
What would his guards think if they heard him shout like a madman ?
He remained silent , his eyes fixed upon the light ; the boat went on , but the prisoner thought only of Mercédès .
An <unk> <unk> of land hid the light .
Dantès turned and perceived that they had got out to sea .
While he had been absorbed in thought , they had <unk> their <unk> and <unk> sail ; the boat was now moving with the wind .
In spite of his <unk> to address the guards , Dantès turned to the nearest gendarme , and taking his hand , “ <unk> , ” said he , “ I <unk> you , as a Christian and a soldier , to tell me where we are going .
I am Captain Dantès , a <unk> Frenchman , thought accused of <unk> ; tell me where you are <unk> me , and I promise you on my honor I will submit to my fate . ” The gendarme looked <unk> at his companion , who returned for answer a sign that said , “ I see no great harm in telling him now , ” and the gendarme replied : “ You are a native of Marseilles , and a sailor , and yet you do not know where you are going ? ” “ On my honor , I have no idea . ” “ Have you no idea whatever ? ” “ None at all . ” “ That is impossible . ” “ I swear to you it is true .
Tell me , I entreat . ” “ But my orders . ” “ Your orders do not <unk> your telling me what I must know in ten minutes , in half an hour , or an hour .
You see I cannot escape , even if I intended . ” “ <unk> you are blind , or have never been outside the <unk> , you must know . ” “ I do not . ” “ Look round you then . ” Dantès rose and looked forward , when he saw rise within a hundred <unk> of him the black and <unk> rock on which stands the Château d ’ If .
This gloomy <unk> , which has for more than three hundred years furnished food for so many wild <unk> , seemed to Dantès like a scaffold to a <unk> .
“ The Château d ’ If ? ” cried he , “ what are we going there for ? ” The gendarme smiled .
“ I am not going there to be <unk> , ” said Dantès ; “ it is only used for political prisoners .
I have committed no crime .
Are there any <unk> or judges at the Château d ’ If ? ” “ There are only , ” said the gendarme , “ a governor , a <unk> , <unk> , and good thick walls .
Come , come , do not look so astonished , or you will make me think you are laughing at me in return for my good nature . ” Dantès pressed the gendarme ’ s hand as though he would crush it .
“ You think , then , ” said he , “ that I am taken to the Château d ’ If to be <unk> there ? ” “ It is probable ; but there is no occasion to <unk> so hard . ” “ Without any inquiry , without any <unk> ? ” “ All the <unk> have been gone through ; the inquiry is already made . ” “ And so , in spite of M. de Villefort ’ s promises ? ” “ I do not know what M. de Villefort promised you , ” said the gendarme , “ but I know we are taking you to the Château d ’ If .
But what are you doing ?
<unk> , comrades , help ! ” By a rapid movement , which the gendarme ’ s <unk> eye had perceived , Dantès sprang forward to <unk> himself into the sea ; but four <unk> arms seized him as his feet quitted the bottom of the boat .
He fell back <unk> with rage .
“ Good ! ” said the gendarme , placing his knee on his chest ; “ this is the way you keep your word as a sailor !
Believe <unk> gentlemen again !
<unk> ye , my friend , I have <unk> my first order , but I will not <unk> the second ; and if you move , I will blow your brains out . ” And he <unk> his <unk> at Dantès , who felt the <unk> against his <unk> .
For a moment the idea of <unk> crossed his mind , and of so <unk> the unexpected evil that had <unk> him .
But he <unk> him of M. de Villefort ’ s promise ; and , besides , death in a boat from the hand of a gendarme seemed too terrible .
He remained motionless , but <unk> his teeth and <unk> his hands with fury .
At this moment the boat came to a landing with a violent shock .
One of the sailors leaped on shore , a <unk> <unk> as it ran through a <unk> , and Dantès guessed they were at the end of the voyage , and that they were <unk> the boat .
His guards , taking him by the arms and <unk> , forced him to rise , and dragged him towards the steps that lead to the gate of the <unk> , while the police officer carrying a <unk> with fixed <unk> followed behind .
Dantès made no resistance ; he was like a man in a dream ; he saw soldiers drawn up on the <unk> ; he knew vaguely that he was <unk> a flight of steps ; he was conscious that he passed through a door , and that the door closed behind him ; but all this <unk> as through a mist .
He did not even see the ocean , that terrible barrier against freedom , which the prisoners look upon with utter despair .
They halted for a minute , during which he strove to collect his thoughts .
He looked around ; he was in a court surrounded by high walls ; he heard the measured tread of <unk> , and as they passed before the light he saw the <unk> of their <unk> <unk> .
They waited <unk> of ten minutes .
Certain Dantès could not escape , the gendarmes released him .
They seemed awaiting orders .
The orders came .
“ Where is the prisoner ? ” said a voice .
“ Here , ” replied the gendarmes .
“ Let him follow me ; I will take him to his cell . ” “ Go ! ” said the gendarmes , <unk> Dantès forward .
The prisoner followed his guide , who led him into a room almost under ground , whose bare and <unk> walls seemed as though <unk> with tears ; a lamp placed on a <unk> <unk> the apartment <unk> , and showed Dantès the features of his <unk> , an <unk> , <unk> , and of <unk> appearance .
<unk> “ Here is your chamber for tonight , ” said he .
“ It is late , and the governor is asleep .
<unk> , perhaps , he may change you .
In the meantime there is bread , water , and fresh straw ; and that is all a prisoner can wish for .
<unk> . ” And before Dantès could open his mouth — before he had noticed where the jailer placed his bread or the water — before he had glanced towards the corner where the straw was , the jailer disappeared , taking with him the lamp and closing the door , leaving stamped upon the prisoner ’ s mind the dim reflection of the <unk> walls of his dungeon .
Dantès was alone in darkness and in silence — cold as the shadows that he felt breathe on his burning forehead .
With the first dawn of day the jailer returned , with orders to leave Dantès where he was .
He found the prisoner in the same position , as if fixed there , his eyes <unk> with weeping .
He had passed the night standing , and without sleep .
The jailer advanced ; Dantès appeared not to perceive him .
He touched him on the shoulder .
Edmond started .
“ Have you not slept ? ” said the jailer .
“ I do not know , ” replied Dantès .
The jailer stared .
“ Are you hungry ? ” continued he .
“ I do not know . ” “ Do you wish for anything ? ” “ I wish to see the governor . ” The jailer shrugged his shoulders and left the chamber .
Dantès followed him with his eyes , and stretched forth his hands towards the open door ; but the door closed .
All his emotion then burst forth ; he cast himself on the ground , weeping bitterly , and asking himself what crime he had committed that he was thus punished .
The day passed thus ; he scarcely <unk> food , but walked round and round the cell like a wild beast in its <unk> .
One thought in particular <unk> him : <unk> , that during his journey hither he had sat so still , <unk> he might , a dozen times , have plunged into the sea , and , thanks to his powers of <unk> , for which he was famous , have gained the shore , concealed himself until the arrival of a <unk> or Spanish vessel , escaped to Spain or Italy , where Mercédès and his father could have joined him .
He had no fears as to how he should live — good <unk> are welcome everywhere .
He spoke Italian like a <unk> , and Spanish like a <unk> ; he would have been free , and happy with Mercédès and his father , <unk> he was now confined in the Château d ’ If , that <unk> <unk> , ignorant of the future destiny of his father and Mercédès ; and all this because he had trusted to Villefort ’ s promise .
The thought was <unk> , and Dantès threw himself <unk> down on his straw .
The next morning at the same hour , the jailer came again .
“ Well , ” said the jailer , “ are you more reasonable today ? ” Dantès made no reply .
“ Come , <unk> up ; is there anything that I can do for you ? ” “ I wish to see the governor . ” “ I have already told you it was impossible . ” “ Why so ? ” “ Because it is against prison <unk> , and prisoners must not even ask for it . ” “ What is allowed , then ? ” “ <unk> <unk> , if you pay for it , books , and leave to walk about . ” “ I do not want books , I am satisfied with my food , and do not care to walk about ; but I wish to see the governor . ” “ If you <unk> me by <unk> the same thing , I will not bring you any more to eat . ” “ Well , then , ” said Edmond , “ if you do not , I shall die of hunger — that is all . ” The jailer saw by his tone he would be happy to die ; and as every prisoner is worth ten sous a day to his jailer , he replied in a more <unk> tone .
“ What you ask is impossible ; but if you are very well behaved you will be allowed to walk about , and some day you will meet the governor , and if he <unk> to reply , that is his affair . ” “ But , ” asked Dantès , “ how long shall I have to wait ? ” “ Ah , a month — six months — a year . ” “ It is too long a time .
I wish to see him at once . ” “ Ah , ” said the jailer , “ do not always <unk> over what is impossible , or you will be mad in a fortnight . ” “ You think so ? ” “ Yes ; we have an instance here ; it was by always offering a million of francs to the governor for his liberty that an abbé became mad , who was in this chamber before you . ” <unk> “ How long has he left it ? ” “ Two years . ” “ Was he <unk> , then ? ” “ No ; he was put in a dungeon . ” “ Listen ! ” said Dantès .
“ I am not an abbé , I am not mad ; perhaps I shall be , but at present , unfortunately , I am not .
I will make you another offer . ” “ What is that ? ” “ I do not offer you a million , because I have it not ; but I will give you a hundred crowns if , the first time you go to Marseilles , you will seek out a young girl named Mercédès , at the Catalans , and give her two lines from me . ” <unk> “ If I took them , and were <unk> , I should lose my place , which is worth two thousand francs a year ; so that I should be a great fool to run such a risk for three hundred . ” “ Well , ” said Dantès , “ mark this ; if you refuse at least to tell Mercédès I am here , I will some day hide myself behind the door , and when you enter I will <unk> out your brains with this <unk> . ” “ <unk> ! ” cried the jailer , retreating and putting himself on the <unk> ; “ you are certainly going mad .
The abbé began like you , and in three days you will be like him , mad enough to <unk> up ; but , fortunately , there are <unk> here . ” Dantès <unk> the <unk> round his head .
“ All right , all right , ” said the jailer ; “ all right , since you will have it so .
I will send word to the governor . ” “ Very well , ” returned Dantès , <unk> the <unk> and sitting on it as if he were in reality mad .
The jailer went out , and returned in an instant with a <unk> and four soldiers .
“ By the governor ’ s orders , ” said he , “ conduct the prisoner to the <unk> beneath . ” “ To the dungeon , then , ” said the <unk> .
“ Yes ; we must put the madman with the <unk> . ” The soldiers seized Dantès , who followed <unk> .
He descended fifteen steps , and the door of a dungeon was opened , and he was thrust in .
The door closed , and Dantès advanced with <unk> hands until he touched the wall ; he then sat down in the corner until his eyes became accustomed to the darkness .
The jailer was right ; Dantès wanted but little of being utterly mad .
Chapter <unk> .
The <unk> of the <unk> Villefort had , as we have said , hastened back to Madame de Saint-Méran ’ s in the Place du <unk> <unk> , and on entering the house found that the guests whom he had left at table were taking coffee in the salon .
Renée was , with all the rest of the company , anxiously awaiting him , and his entrance was followed by a general exclamation .
“ Well , <unk> , <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , what is the matter ? ” said one .
“ Speak out . ” “ Are we threatened with a fresh <unk> of <unk> ? ” asked another .
“ Has the Corsican <unk> broken loose ? ” cried a third .
“ <unk> , ” said Villefort , approaching his future <unk> , “ I request your pardon for thus leaving you .
Will the marquis honor me by a few moments ’ private conversation ? ” “ Ah , it is really a serious matter , then ? ” asked the marquis , <unk> the cloud on Villefort ’ s brow .
“ So serious that I must take leave of you for a few days ; so , ” added he , turning to Renée , “ judge for yourself if it be not important . ” “ You are going to leave us ? ” cried Renée , unable to hide her emotion at this unexpected <unk> .
“ Alas , ” returned Villefort , “ I must ! ” “ Where , then , are you going ? ” asked the marquise .
“ That , madame , is an official secret ; but if you have any <unk> for Paris , a friend of mine is going there tonight , and will with pleasure <unk> them . ” The guests looked at each other .
“ You wish to speak to me alone ? ” said the marquis .
“ Yes , let us go to the library , please . ” The marquis took his arm , and they left the salon .
“ Well , ” asked he , as soon as they were by themselves , “ tell me what it is ? ” “ An affair of the greatest importance , that demands my immediate presence in Paris .
Now , excuse the <unk> , marquis , but have you any landed property ? ” “ All my fortune is in the <unk> ; seven or eight hundred thousand francs . ” “ Then sell out — sell out , marquis , or you will lose it all . ” <unk> “ But how can I sell out here ? ” “ You have a <unk> , have you not ? ” “ Yes . ” “ Then give me a letter to him , and tell him to sell out without an instant ’ s delay , perhaps even now I shall arrive too late . ” “ The deuce you say ! ” replied the marquis , “ let us lose no time , then ! ” And , sitting down , he wrote a letter to his <unk> , <unk> him to sell out at the <unk> price .
“ Now , then , ” said Villefort , placing the letter in his <unk> , “ I must have another ! ” “ To whom ? ” “ To the king . ” “ To the king ? ” “ Yes . ” “ I dare not write to his majesty . ” “ I do not ask you to write to his majesty , but ask M. de <unk> to do so .
I want a letter that will <unk> me to reach the king ’ s presence without all the <unk> of <unk> an audience ; that would occasion a loss of precious time . ” “ But address yourself to the <unk> of the <unk> ; he has the right of entry at the Tuileries , and can procure you audience at any hour of the day or night . ” “ <unk> ; but there is no occasion to <unk> the <unk> of my discovery with him .
The <unk> would leave me in the background , and take all the glory to himself .
I tell you , marquis , my fortune is made if I only reach the Tuileries the first , for the king will not forget the service I do him . ” “ In that case go and get ready .
I will call <unk> and make him write the letter . ” “ Be as quick as possible , I must be on the road in a quarter of an hour . ” “ Tell your coachman to stop at the door . ” “ You will present my <unk> to the marquise and Mademoiselle Renée , whom I leave on such a day with great regret . ” “ You will find them both here , and can make your <unk> in person . ” “ A thousand thanks — and now for the letter . ” The marquis rang , a servant entered .
“ Say to the Comte de <unk> that I would like to see him . ” “ Now , then , go , ” said the marquis .
“ I shall be gone only a few moments . ” Villefort hastily quitted the apartment , but <unk> that the sight of the deputy procureur running through the streets would be enough to throw the whole city into confusion , he resumed his ordinary pace .
At his door he perceived a figure in the shadow that seemed to wait for him .
It was Mercédès , who , hearing no news of her lover , had come <unk> to inquire after him .
As Villefort drew near , she advanced and stood before him .
Dantès had spoken of Mercédès , and Villefort instantly recognized her .
Her beauty and high bearing surprised him , and when she inquired what had become of her lover , it seemed to him that she was the judge , and he the accused .
“ The young man you speak of , ” said Villefort abruptly , “ is a great criminal , and I can do nothing for him , mademoiselle . ” Mercédès burst into tears , and , as Villefort strove to pass her , again addressed him .
“ But , at least , tell me where he is , that I may know whether he is alive or dead , ” said she .
<unk> “ I do not know ; he is no longer in my hands , ” replied Villefort .
And desirous of putting an end to the interview , he pushed by her , and closed the door , as if to <unk> the pain he felt .
But remorse is not thus <unk> ; like <unk> ’ s wounded hero , he carried the <unk> in his wound , and , arrived at the salon , Villefort uttered a sigh that was almost a sob , and sank into a chair .
Then the first <unk> of an <unk> torture seized upon his heart .
The man he <unk> to his ambition , that innocent victim <unk> on the altar of his father ’ s faults , appeared to him pale and threatening , leading his <unk> bride by the hand , and bringing with him remorse , not such as the <unk> <unk> , furious and terrible , but that slow and <unk> agony whose <unk> are <unk> from hour to hour up to the very moment of death .
Then he had a moment ’ s hesitation .
He had frequently called for capital punishment on <unk> , and owing to his irresistible <unk> they had been condemned , and yet the slightest shadow of remorse had never <unk> Villefort ’ s brow , because they were guilty ; at least , he believed so ; but here was an innocent man whose happiness he had destroyed .
In this case he was not the judge , but the executioner .
As he thus reflected , he felt the sensation we have described , and which had hitherto been unknown to him , arise in his bosom , and fill him with vague <unk> .
It is thus that a wounded man <unk> instinctively at the approach of the finger to his wound until it be <unk> , but Villefort ’ s was one of those that never close , or if they do , only close to <unk> more <unk> than ever .
If at this moment the sweet voice of Renée had sounded in his ears <unk> for mercy , or the fair Mercédès had entered and said , “ In the name of God , I <unk> you to restore me my <unk> husband , ” his cold and trembling hands would have signed his <unk> ; but no voice broke the <unk> of the chamber , and the door was opened only by Villefort ’ s valet , who came to tell him that the travelling carriage was in readiness .
Villefort rose , or rather sprang , from his chair , hastily opened one of the <unk> of his desk , <unk> all the gold it contained into his pocket , stood motionless an instant , his hand pressed to his head , muttered a few <unk> sounds , and then , perceiving that his servant had placed his cloak on his shoulders , he sprang into the carriage , <unk> the <unk> to drive to M. de Saint-Méran ’ s .
The <unk> Dantès was <unk> .
As the marquis had promised , Villefort found the marquise and Renée in waiting .
He started when he saw Renée , for he fancied she was again about to <unk> for Dantès .
Alas , her emotions were wholly personal : she was thinking only of Villefort ’ s departure .
She loved Villefort , and he left her at the moment he was about to become her husband .
Villefort knew not when he should return , and Renée , far from <unk> for Dantès , hated the man whose crime separated her from her lover .
<unk> Meanwhile what of Mercédès ?
She had met Fernand at the corner of the Rue de la <unk> ; she had returned to the Catalans , and had <unk> cast herself on her <unk> .
Fernand , kneeling by her side , took her hand , and covered it with <unk> that Mercédès did not even feel .
She passed the night thus .
The lamp went out for want of <unk> , but she paid no heed to the darkness , and dawn came , but she knew not that it was day .
<unk> had made her blind to all but one object — that was Edmond .
“ Ah , you are there , ” said she , at length , turning towards Fernand .
“ I have not quitted you since yesterday , ” returned Fernand <unk> .
M. Morrel had not readily given up the fight .
He had learned that Dantès had been taken to prison , and he had gone to all his friends , and the <unk> persons of the city ; but the report was already in <unk> that Dantès was arrested as a Bonapartist agent ; and as the most <unk> looked upon any attempt of Napoleon to <unk> the throne as impossible , he met with nothing but refusal , and had returned home in despair , <unk> that the matter was serious and that nothing more could be done .
Caderousse was equally <unk> and uneasy , but instead of seeking , like M. Morrel , to aid Dantès , he had shut himself up with two bottles of black <unk> brandy , in the hope of <unk> reflection .
But he did not succeed , and became too intoxicated to fetch any more drink , and yet not so intoxicated as to forget what had happened .
With his elbows on the table he sat between the two empty bottles , while <unk> danced in the light of the <unk> candle — <unk> such as <unk> <unk> over his <unk> pages , like black , fantastic dust .
Danglars alone was content and joyous — he had got rid of an enemy and made his own situation on the _ Pharaon _ secure .
Danglars was one of those men born with a pen behind the ear , and an <unk> in place of a heart .
Everything with him was <unk> or <unk> .
The life of a man was to him of far less value than a <unk> , especially when , by taking it away , he could increase the sum total of his own desires .
He went to bed at his usual hour , and slept in peace .
Villefort , after having received M. de <unk> ’ s letter , embraced Renée , kissed the marquise ’ s hand , and shaken that of the marquis , started for Paris along the <unk> road .
Old Dantès was dying with anxiety to know what had become of Edmond .
But we know very well what had become of Edmond .
Chapter <unk> .
The King ’ s <unk> at the Tuileries We will leave Villefort on the road to Paris , travelling — thanks to <unk> fees — with all speed , and passing through two or three apartments , enter at the Tuileries the little room with the <unk> window , so well known as having been the favorite <unk> of Napoleon and Louis XVIII . , and now of Louis Philippe .
There , seated before a <unk> table he had brought with him from <unk> , and to which , from one of those fancies not <unk> to great people , he was particularly attached , the king , Louis XVIII . , was <unk> listening to a man of fifty or <unk> years of age , with gray hair , <unk> bearing , and exceedingly <unk> <unk> , and meanwhile making a <unk> note in a volume of <unk> ’ s rather <unk> , but much <unk> , <unk> of <unk> — a work which was much indebted to the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
“ You say , sir — — ” said the king .
“ That I am exceedingly <unk> , sire . ” “ Really , have you had a vision of the seven fat <unk> and the seven <unk> <unk> ? ” “ No , sire , for that would only <unk> for us seven years of plenty and seven years of <unk> ; and with a king as full of <unk> as your majesty , <unk> is not a thing to be feared . ” “ Then of what other <unk> are you afraid , my dear Blacas ? ” “ Sire , I have every reason to believe that a storm is <unk> in the south . ” “ Well , my dear duke , ” replied Louis XVIII . , “ I think you are <unk> informed , and know positively that , on the contrary , it is very fine weather in that direction . ” Man of <unk> as he was , Louis XVIII .
liked a pleasant jest .
“ Sire , ” continued M. de Blacas , “ if it only be to <unk> a faithful servant , will your majesty send into <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> men , who will bring you back a faithful report as to the feeling in these three <unk> ? ” “ _ <unk> <unk> _ , ” replied the king , <unk> the <unk> in his <unk> .
“ Sire , ” replied the <unk> , laughing , in order that he might seem to comprehend the <unk> , “ your majesty may be perfectly right in <unk> on the good feeling of France , but I fear I am not altogether wrong in <unk> some desperate attempt . ” “ By whom ? ” “ By Bonaparte , or , at least , by his <unk> . ” “ My dear Blacas , ” said the king , “ you with your <unk> prevent me from working . ” “ And you , sire , prevent me from sleeping with your security . ” “ Wait , my dear sir , wait a moment ; for I have such a delightful note on the _ <unk> <unk> <unk> _ — wait , and I will listen to you afterwards . ” There was a brief pause , during which Louis XVIII .
wrote , in a hand as small as possible , another note on the <unk> of his <unk> , and then looking at the duke with the air of a man who thinks he has an idea of his own , while he is only <unk> upon the idea of another , said : “ Go on , my dear duke , go on — I listen . ” “ Sire , ” said Blacas , who had for a moment the hope of <unk> Villefort to his own profit , “ I am compelled to tell you that these are not mere <unk> <unk> of foundation which thus <unk> me ; but a <unk> man , <unk> all my confidence , and charged by me to watch over the south ” ( the duke hesitated as he pronounced these words ) , “ has arrived by post to tell me that a great peril <unk> the king , and so I hastened to you , sire . ” “ _ <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> _ , ” continued Louis XVIII . , still <unk> .
“ Does your majesty wish me to drop the subject ? ” “ By no means , my dear duke ; but just <unk> out your hand . ” “ Which ? ” “ <unk> you please — there to the left . ” “ Here , sire ? ” “ I tell you to the left , and you are looking to the right ; I mean on my left — yes , there .
You will find yesterday ’ s report of the minister of police .
But here is M. <unk> himself ; ” and M. <unk> , announced by the <unk> , entered .
“ Come in , ” said Louis XVIII . , with <unk> smile , “ come in , Baron , and tell the duke all you know — the <unk> news of M. de Bonaparte ; do not conceal anything , however serious , — let us see , the Island of Elba is a <unk> , and we may expect to have <unk> thence <unk> and bristling war — _ <unk> , <unk> <unk> _ . ” M. <unk> leaned very <unk> on the back of a chair with his two hands , and said : “ Has your majesty <unk> yesterday ’ s report ? ” “ Yes , yes ; but tell the duke himself , who cannot find anything , what the report contains — give him the particulars of what the usurper is doing in his <unk> . ” “ Monsieur , ” said the baron to the duke , “ all the servants of his majesty must approve of the <unk> intelligence which we have from the Island of Elba .
Bonaparte — — ” M. <unk> looked at Louis XVIII . , who , employed in writing a note , did not even raise his head .
“ Bonaparte , ” continued the baron , “ is <unk> <unk> , and passes whole days in watching his <unk> at work at <unk> . ” “ And <unk> himself for amusement , ” added the king .
“ <unk> himself ? ” inquired the duke , “ what does your majesty mean ? ” “ Yes , indeed , my dear duke .
Did you forget that this great man , this hero , this <unk> , is attacked with a malady of the skin which <unk> him to death , _ <unk> _ ? ” “ And , moreover , my dear duke , ” continued the minister of police , “ we are almost assured that , in a very short time , the usurper will be <unk> . ” “ <unk> ? ” “ <unk> mad ; his head becomes <unk> .
Sometimes he <unk> bitterly , sometimes <unk> <unk> , at other time he passes hours on the <unk> , <unk> stones in the water and when the <unk> makes ‘ <unk> ’ five or six times , he appears as delighted as if he had gained another <unk> or Austerlitz .
Now , you must agree that these are <unk> symptoms of <unk> . ” “ Or of wisdom , my dear baron — or of wisdom , ” said Louis XVIII . , laughing ; “ the greatest <unk> of <unk> amused themselves by casting <unk> into the ocean — see <unk> ’ s life of <unk> <unk> . ” M. de Blacas <unk> deeply between the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> minister .
Villefort , who did not choose to reveal the whole secret , lest another should <unk> all the benefit of the <unk> , had yet communicated enough to cause him the greatest uneasiness .
“ Well , well , <unk> , ” said Louis XVIII . , “ Blacas is not yet convinced ; let us proceed , therefore , to the usurper ’ s <unk> . ” The minister of police bowed .
“ The usurper ’ s <unk> ! ” murmured the duke , looking at the king and <unk> , who spoke <unk> , like <unk> ’ s <unk> .
“ The usurper converted ! ” “ <unk> , my dear duke . ” “ In what way converted ? ” “ To good principles .
Tell him all about it , baron . ” “ Why , this is the way of it , ” said the minister , with the <unk> air in the world : “ Napoleon lately had a <unk> , and as two or three of his old <unk> expressed a desire to return to France , he gave them their <unk> , and <unk> them to ‘ serve the good king . ’ These were his own words , of that I am certain . ” “ Well , Blacas , what think you of this ? ” inquired the king <unk> , and <unk> for a moment from the <unk> <unk> before him .
“ I say , sire , that the minister of police is greatly deceived or I am ; and as it is impossible it can be the minister of police as he has the <unk> of the safety and honor of your majesty , it is probable that I am in error .
However , sire , if I might advise , your majesty will <unk> the person of whom I spoke to you , and I will <unk> your majesty to do him this honor . ” “ Most willingly , duke ; under your <unk> I will receive any person you please , but you must not expect me to be too <unk> .
Baron , have you any report more recent than this , <unk> the <unk> February , and this is the <unk> of March ? ” “ No , sire , but I am <unk> expecting one ; it may have arrived since I left my office . ” “ Go thither , and if there be none — well , well , ” continued Louis XVIII . , “ make one ; that is the usual way , is it not ? ” and the king laughed <unk> .
“ Oh , sire , ” replied the minister , “ we have no occasion to <unk> any ; every day our <unk> are loaded with most <unk> <unk> , coming from <unk> of people who hope for some return for services which they seek to render , but cannot ; they trust to fortune , and rely upon some unexpected event in some way to <unk> their <unk> . ” “ Well , sir , go , ” said Louis XVIII . , “ and remember that I am waiting for you . ” “ I will but go and return , sire ; I shall be back in ten minutes . ” “ And I , sire , ” said M. de Blacas , “ will go and find my messenger . ” “ Wait , sir , wait , ” said Louis XVIII .
“ Really , M. de Blacas , I must change your <unk> <unk> ; I will give you an eagle with <unk> wings , holding in its <unk> a prey which <unk> in vain to escape , and bearing this <unk> — _ <unk> _ . ” <unk> “ Sire , I listen , ” said De Blacas , <unk> his nails with impatience .
“ I wish to consult you on this passage , ‘ _ <unk> <unk> <unk> _ , ’ you know it <unk> to a <unk> flying from a wolf .
Are you not a <unk> and a great <unk> ?
Well , then , what do you think of the _ <unk> <unk> _ ? ” “ <unk> , sire ; but my messenger is like the <unk> you <unk> to , for he has posted two hundred and twenty leagues in scarcely three days . ” “ Which is <unk> great fatigue and anxiety , my dear duke , when we have a telegraph which <unk> <unk> in three or four hours , and that without getting in the least out of breath . ” “ Ah , sire , you recompense but badly this poor young man , who has come so far , and with so much <unk> , to give your majesty useful information .
If only for the sake of M. de <unk> , who <unk> him to me , I entreat your majesty to receive him <unk> . ” “ M.
de <unk> , my brother ’ s <unk> ? ” “ Yes , sire . ” “ He is at Marseilles . ” “ And writes me thence . ” “ Does he speak to you of this <unk> ? ” “ No ; but strongly <unk> M. de Villefort , and <unk> me to present him to your majesty . ” “ M.
de Villefort ! ” cried the king , “ is the messenger ’ s name M. de Villefort ? ” “ Yes , sire . ” “ And he comes from Marseilles ? ” “ In person . ” “ Why did you not mention his name at once ? ” replied the king , <unk> some uneasiness .
“ Sire , I thought his name was unknown to your majesty . ” “ No , no , Blacas ; he is a man of strong and elevated understanding , <unk> , too , and , _ <unk> ! _ you know his father ’ s name ! ” “ His father ? ” “ Yes , Noirtier . ” “ Noirtier the <unk> ? — Noirtier the <unk> ? ” “ He himself . ” “ And your majesty has employed the son of such a man ? ” “ Blacas , my friend , you have but limited <unk> .
I told you Villefort was <unk> , and to <unk> this ambition Villefort would sacrifice everything , even his father . ” “ Then , sire , may I present him ? ” “ This instant , duke !
Where is he ? ” “ <unk> below , in my carriage . ” “ <unk> him at once . ” “ I hasten to do so . ” The duke left the royal presence with the speed of a young man ; his really sincere <unk> made him youthful again .
Louis XVIII .
remained alone , and turning his eyes on his <unk> <unk> , muttered : “ _ <unk> et <unk> <unk> <unk> _ . ” M. de Blacas returned as speedily as he had departed , but in the antechamber he was forced to appeal to the king ’ s authority .
Villefort ’ s <unk> <unk> , his costume , which was not of <unk> cut , excited the <unk> of M. de <unk> , who was all astonishment at finding that this young man had the <unk> to enter before the king in such <unk> .
The duke , however , <unk> all difficulties with a word — his majesty ’ s order ; and , in spite of the <unk> which the master of <unk> made for the honor of his office and principles , Villefort was introduced .
The king was seated in the same place where the duke had left him .
On opening the door , Villefort found himself facing him , and the young magistrate ’ s first impulse was to pause .
“ Come in , M. de Villefort , ” said the king , “ come in . ” Villefort bowed , and advancing a few steps , waited until the king should <unk> him .
“ M.
de Villefort , ” said Louis XVIII . , “ the Duc de Blacas <unk> me you have some interesting information to communicate . ” “ Sire , the duke is right , and I believe your majesty will think it equally important . ” <unk> “ In the first place , and before everything else , sir , is the news as bad in your opinion as I am asked to believe ? ” “ Sire , I believe it to be most <unk> , but I hope , by the speed I have used , that it is not <unk> . ” “ Speak as fully as you please , sir , ” said the king , who began to give way to the emotion which had showed itself in Blacas ’ s face and affected Villefort ’ s voice .
“ Speak , sir , and pray begin at the beginning ; I like order in everything . ” “ Sire , ” said Villefort , “ I will render a faithful report to your majesty , but I must entreat your <unk> if my anxiety leads to some obscurity in my language . ” A glance at the king after this <unk> and <unk> <unk> , assured Villefort of the <unk> of his august <unk> , and he went on : “ Sire , I have come as rapidly to Paris as possible , to inform your majesty that I have discovered , in the exercise of my duties , not a <unk> and <unk> plot , such as is every day got up in the lower ranks of the people and in the army , but an actual <unk> — a storm which <unk> no less than your majesty ’ s throne .
Sire , the usurper is <unk> three <unk> , he <unk> some project , which , however mad , is yet , perhaps , terrible .
At this moment he will have left Elba , to go whither I know not , but assuredly to attempt a landing either at Naples , or on the coast of <unk> , or perhaps on the <unk> of France .
Your majesty is well aware that the sovereign of the Island of Elba has <unk> his relations with Italy and France ? ” “ I am , sir , ” said the king , much agitated ; “ and recently we have had information that the Bonapartist <unk> have had <unk> in the Rue Saint-Jacques .
But proceed , I beg of you .
How did you obtain these details ? ” “ Sire , they are the results of an examination which I have made of a man of Marseilles , whom I have watched for some time , and arrested on the day of my departure .
This person , a sailor , of <unk> character , and whom I suspected of <unk> , has been <unk> to the Island of Elba .
There he saw the <unk> , who charged him with an <unk> message to a Bonapartist in Paris , whose name I could not <unk> from him ; but this mission was to prepare men ’ s minds for a return ( it is the man who says this , sire ) — a return which will soon occur . ” “ And where is this man ? ” “ In prison , sire . ” “ And the matter seems serious to you ? ” “ So serious , sire , that when the circumstance surprised me in the midst of a family festival , on the very day of my <unk> , I left my bride and friends , <unk> everything , that I might hasten to lay at your majesty ’ s feet the fears which impressed me , and the assurance of my devotion . ” “ True , ” said Louis XVIII . , “ was there not a marriage engagement between you and Mademoiselle de Saint-Méran ? ” “ <unk> of one of your majesty ’ s most faithful servants . ” “ Yes , yes ; but let us talk of this plot , M. de Villefort . ” “ Sire , I fear it is more than a plot ; I fear it is a <unk> . ” “ A <unk> in these times , ” said Louis XVIII . , smiling , “ is a thing very easy to <unk> , but more difficult to conduct to an end , <unk> as , <unk> so recently on the throne of our <unk> , we have our eyes open at once upon the past , the present , and the future .
For the last ten months my <unk> have redoubled their <unk> , in order to watch the shore of the <unk> .
If Bonaparte landed at Naples , the whole <unk> would be on foot before he could even reach <unk> ; if he land in <unk> , he will be in an <unk> <unk> ; if he land in France , it must be with a handful of men , and the result of that is easily <unk> , <unk> as he is by the <unk> .
Take courage , sir ; but at the same time rely on our royal gratitude . ” “ Ah , here is M. <unk> ! ” cried de Blacas .
At this instant the minister of police appeared at the door , pale , trembling , and as if ready to faint .
Villefort was about to retire , but M. de Blacas , taking his hand , restrained him .
Chapter <unk> .
The Corsican <unk> At the sight of this agitation Louis XVIII .
pushed from him violently the table at which he was sitting .
“ What <unk> you , baron ? ” he exclaimed .
“ You appear quite <unk> .
Has your uneasiness anything to do with what M. de Blacas has told me , and M. de Villefort has just confirmed ? ” M. de Blacas moved suddenly towards the baron , but the fright of the <unk> <unk> for the <unk> of the <unk> ; and besides , as matters were , it was much more to his advantage that the prefect of police should triumph over him than that he should <unk> the prefect .
“ Sire , — — ” stammered the baron .
“ Well , what is it ? ” asked Louis XVIII .
The minister of police , giving way to an impulse of despair , was about to throw himself at the feet of Louis XVIII . , who retreated a step and <unk> .
“ Will you speak ? ” he said .
“ Oh , sire , what a dreadful misfortune !
I am , indeed , to be <unk> .
I can never forgive myself ! ” “ Monsieur , ” said Louis XVIII . , “ I command you to speak . ” “ Well , sire , the usurper left Elba on the <unk> February , and landed on the <unk> of March . ” “ And where ?
In Italy ? ” asked the king eagerly .
“ In France , sire , — at a small port , near <unk> , in the <unk> of <unk> . ” “ The usurper landed in France , near <unk> , in the <unk> of <unk> , two hundred and fifty leagues from Paris , on the <unk> of March , and you only acquired this information today , the <unk> of March !
Well , sir , what you tell me is impossible .
You must have received a false report , or you have gone mad . ” “ Alas , sire , it is but too true ! ” Louis made a gesture of indescribable anger and alarm , and then drew himself up as if this sudden blow had struck him at the same moment in heart and countenance .
“ In France ! ” he cried , “ the usurper in France !
Then they did not watch over this man .
Who knows ?
they were , perhaps , in league with him . ” “ Oh , sire , ” exclaimed the Duc de Blacas , “ M.
<unk> is not a man to be accused of <unk> !
Sire , we have all been blind , and the minister of police has shared the general blindness , that is all . ” “ But — — ” said Villefort , and then suddenly <unk> himself , he was silent ; then he continued , “ Your pardon , sire , ” he said , bowing , “ my <unk> carried me away .
Will your majesty <unk> to excuse me ? ” “ Speak , sir , speak <unk> , ” replied Louis .
“ You alone <unk> us of the evil ; now try and aid us with the remedy . ” “ Sire , ” said Villefort , “ the usurper is <unk> in the south ; and it seems to me that if he ventured into the south , it would be easy to raise <unk> and <unk> against him . ” “ Yes , assuredly , ” replied the minister ; “ but he is advancing by <unk> and <unk> . ” “ <unk> — he is advancing ! ” said Louis XVIII .
“ Is he then advancing on Paris ? ” The minister of police <unk> a silence which was <unk> to a complete <unk> .
“ And <unk> , sir ? ” inquired the king , of Villefort .
“ Do you think it possible to <unk> that as well as <unk> ? ” “ Sire , I am sorry to tell your majesty a cruel fact ; but the feeling in <unk> is quite the <unk> of that in <unk> or <unk> .
The <unk> are <unk> , sire . ” “ Then , ” murmured Louis , “ he was well informed .
And how many men had he with him ? ” “ I do not know , sire , ” answered the minister of police .
“ What , you do not know !
Have you neglected to obtain information on that point ?
Of course it is of no consequence , ” he added , with a <unk> smile .
“ Sire , it was impossible to learn ; the <unk> simply stated the fact of the landing and the <unk> taken by the usurper . ” “ And how did this <unk> reach you ? ” inquired the king .
The minister bowed his head , and while a deep color <unk> his cheeks , he stammered out : “ By the telegraph , sire . ” Louis XVIII .
advanced a step , and folded his arms over his chest as Napoleon would have done .
<unk> “ So then , ” he exclaimed , turning pale with anger , “ seven <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> that man .
A miracle of heaven replaced me on the throne of my fathers after <unk> years of <unk> .
I have , during those <unk> years , spared no pains to understand the people of France and the interests which were <unk> to me ; and now , when I see the <unk> of my wishes almost within reach , the power I hold in my hands <unk> and <unk> me to <unk> ! ” “ Sire , it is fatality ! ” murmured the minister , feeling that the pressure of circumstances , however light a thing to destiny , was too much for any human strength to endure .
“ What our enemies say of us is then true .
We have <unk> nothing , forgotten nothing !
If I were betrayed as he was , I would console myself ; but to be in the midst of persons elevated by myself to places of honor , who ought to watch over me more carefully than over themselves , — for my fortune is <unk> — before me they were nothing — after me they will be nothing , and <unk> <unk> from <unk> — <unk> !
Oh , yes , sir , you are right — it is fatality ! ” The minister <unk> before this <unk> of <unk> .
M. de Blacas wiped the <unk> from his brow .
Villefort smiled within himself , for he felt his increased importance .
“ To fall , ” continued King Louis , who at the first glance had sounded the abyss on which the monarchy hung suspended , — “ to fall , and learn of that fall by telegraph !
Oh , I would rather <unk> the scaffold of my brother , Louis <unk> . , than thus descend the staircase at the Tuileries driven away by <unk> .
<unk> , sir — why , you know not its power in France , and yet you ought to know it ! ” “ Sire , sire , ” murmured the minister , “ for pity ’ s — — ” “ <unk> , M. de Villefort , ” resumed the king , addressing the young man , who , motionless and breathless , was listening to a conversation on which depended the destiny of a <unk> .
“ <unk> , and tell monsieur that it is possible to know beforehand all that he has not known . ” “ Sire , it was really impossible to learn secrets which that man concealed from all the world . ” “ Really impossible !
Yes — that is a great word , sir .
<unk> , there are great words , as there are great men ; I have measured them .
Really impossible for a minister who has an office , agents , <unk> , and fifteen hundred thousand francs for secret service money , to know what is going on at sixty leagues from the coast of France !
Well , then , see , here is a gentleman who had none of these resources at his disposal — a gentleman , only a simple magistrate , who learned more than you with all your police , and who would have saved my crown , if , like you , he had the power of <unk> a telegraph . ” The look of the minister of police was turned with <unk> spite on Villefort , who bent his head in modest triumph .
“ I do not mean that for you , Blacas , ” continued Louis XVIII .
; “ for if you have discovered nothing , at least you have had the good sense to <unk> in your suspicions .
Any other than yourself would have considered the <unk> of M. de Villefort <unk> , or else <unk> by <unk> ambition . ” These words were an allusion to the sentiments which the minister of police had uttered with so much confidence an hour before .
Villefort understood the king ’ s <unk> .
Any other person would , perhaps , have been overcome by such an <unk> draught of praise ; but he feared to make for himself a mortal enemy of the police minister , although he saw that <unk> was <unk> lost .
In fact , the minister , who , in the <unk> of his power , had been unable to <unk> Napoleon ’ s secret , might in despair at his own <unk> <unk> Dantès and so lay bare the motives of Villefort ’ s plot .
<unk> this , Villefort came to the <unk> of the <unk> minister , instead of <unk> to crush him .
“ Sire , ” said Villefort , “ the <unk> of this event must prove to your majesty that the issue is in the hands of Providence ; what your majesty is pleased to <unk> to me as profound <unk> is simply owing to chance , and I have <unk> by that chance , like a good and devoted servant — that ’ s all .
Do not <unk> to me more than I deserve , sire , that your majesty may never have occasion to recall the first opinion you have been pleased to form of me . ” The minister of police thanked the young man by an <unk> look , and Villefort understood that he had succeeded in his design ; that is to say , that without <unk> the gratitude of the king , he had made a friend of one on whom , in case of necessity , he might rely .
“ ’ Tis well , ” resumed the king .
“ And now , gentlemen , ” he continued , turning towards M. de Blacas and the minister of police , “ I have no further occasion for you , and you may retire ; what now remains to do is in the <unk> of the minister of war . ” “ Fortunately , sire , ” said M. de Blacas , “ we can rely on the army ; your majesty knows how every report <unk> their <unk> and attachment . ” “ Do not mention reports , duke , to me , for I know now what confidence to place in them .
Yet , speaking of reports , baron , what have you learned with regard to the affair in the Rue Saint-Jacques ? ” “ The affair in the Rue Saint-Jacques ! ” exclaimed Villefort , unable to <unk> an exclamation .
Then , suddenly <unk> , he added , “ Your pardon , sire , but my devotion to your majesty has made me forget , not the respect I have , for that is too deeply <unk> in my heart , but the <unk> of <unk> . ” “ Go on , go on , sir , ” replied the king ; “ you have today earned the right to make inquiries here . ” “ Sire , ” <unk> the minister of police , “ I came a moment ago to give your majesty fresh information which I had obtained on this head , when your majesty ’ s attention was attracted by the terrible event that has occurred in the gulf , and now these facts will cease to interest your majesty . ” “ On the contrary , sir , — on the contrary , ” said Louis XVIII . , “ this affair seems to me to have a decided connection with that which <unk> our attention , and the death of General <unk> will , perhaps , put us on the direct track of a great <unk> <unk> . ” At the name of General <unk> , Villefort trembled .
“ Everything points to the conclusion , sire , ” said the minister of police , “ that death was not the result of suicide , as we first believed , but of <unk> .
General <unk> , it appears , had just left a Bonapartist club when he disappeared .
An unknown person had been with him that morning , and made an <unk> with him in the Rue Saint-Jacques ; unfortunately , the general ’ s valet , who was <unk> his hair at the moment when the stranger entered , heard the street mentioned , but did not catch the number . ” As the police minister related this to the king , Villefort , who looked as if his very life hung on the <unk> ’ s lips , turned <unk> red and pale .
The king looked towards him .
“ Do you not think with me , M. de Villefort , that General <unk> , whom they believed attached to the usurper , but who was really entirely devoted to me , has <unk> the victim of a Bonapartist <unk> ? ” “ It is probable , sire , ” replied Villefort .
“ But is this all that is known ? ” “ They are on the track of the man who appointed the meeting with him . ” “ On his track ? ” said Villefort .
“ Yes , the servant has given his description .
He is a man of from fifty to <unk> years of age , dark , with black eyes covered with <unk> eyebrows , and a thick <unk> .
He was dressed in a blue <unk> , <unk> up to the chin , and wore at his <unk> the <unk> of an officer of the Legion of Honor .
<unk> a person exactly <unk> with this description was followed , but he was lost sight of at the corner of the Rue de la <unk> and the Rue <unk> . ” Villefort leaned on the back of an armchair , for as the minister of police went on speaking he felt his legs bend under him ; but when he learned that the unknown had escaped the <unk> of the agent who followed him , he breathed again .
“ <unk> to seek for this man , sir , ” said the king to the minister of police ; “ for if , as I am all but convinced , General <unk> , who would have been so useful to us at this moment , has been murdered , his <unk> , <unk> or not , shall be <unk> punished . ” It required all Villefort ’ s coolness not to betray the terror with which this declaration of the king inspired him .
“ How strange , ” continued the king , with some <unk> ; “ the police think that they have disposed of the whole matter when they say , ‘ A murder has been committed , ’ and especially so when they can add , ‘ And we are on the track of the guilty persons . ’ ” “ Sire , your majesty will , I trust , be <unk> satisfied on this point at least . ” “ We shall see .
I will no longer <unk> you , M. de Villefort , for you must be fatigued after so long a journey ; go and rest .
Of course you stopped at your father ’ s ? ” A feeling of <unk> came over Villefort .
<unk> “ No , sire , ” he replied , “ I <unk> at the <unk> de <unk> , in the Rue de <unk> . ” “ But you have seen him ? ” “ Sire , I went straight to the Duc de Blacas . ” “ But you will see him , then ? ” “ I think not , sire . ” “ Ah , I forgot , ” said Louis , smiling in a manner which proved that all these questions were not made without a motive ; “ I forgot you and M. Noirtier are not on the best terms possible , and that is another sacrifice made to the royal cause , and for which you should be <unk> . ” “ Sire , the kindness your majesty <unk> to <unk> towards me is a recompense which so far <unk> my utmost ambition that I have nothing more to ask for . ” “ Never mind , sir , we will not forget you ; make your mind easy .
In the meanwhile ” ( the king here detached the cross of the Legion of Honor which he usually wore over his blue coat , near the cross of St. Louis , above the order of <unk> and St. <unk> , and gave it to Villefort ) — “ in the meanwhile take this cross . ” “ Sire , ” said Villefort , “ your majesty <unk> ; this is an officer ’ s cross . ” “ _ Ma foi ! _ ” said Louis XVIII . , “ take it , such as it is , for I have not the time to procure you another .
Blacas , let it be your care to see that the <unk> is made out and sent to M. de Villefort . ” Villefort ’ s eyes were filled with tears of joy and pride ; he took the cross and kissed it .
“ And now , ” he said , “ may I inquire what are the orders with which your majesty <unk> to honor me ? ” “ Take what rest you require , and remember that if you are not able to serve me here in Paris , you may be of the greatest service to me at Marseilles . ” “ Sire , ” replied Villefort , bowing , “ in an hour I shall have quitted Paris . ” “ Go , sir , ” said the king ; “ and should I forget you ( kings ’ memories are short ) , do not be afraid to bring yourself to my recollection .
Baron , send for the minister of war .
Blacas , remain . ” “ Ah , sir , ” said the minister of police to Villefort , as they left the Tuileries , “ you entered by luck ’ s door — your fortune is made . ” “ Will it be long first ? ” muttered Villefort , <unk> the minister , whose career was ended , and looking about him for a <unk> .
One passed at the moment , which he <unk> ; he gave his address to the driver , and <unk> in , threw himself on the seat , and gave loose to dreams of ambition .
Ten minutes afterwards Villefort reached his hotel , ordered horses to be ready in two hours , and asked to have his breakfast brought to him .
He was about to begin his <unk> when the sound of the bell rang sharp and loud .
The valet opened the door , and Villefort heard someone speak his name .
<unk> “ Who could know that I was here already ? ” said the young man .
The valet entered .
“ Well , ” said Villefort , “ what is it ? — Who rang ? — Who asked for me ? ” “ A stranger who will not send in his name . ” “ A stranger who will not send in his name !
What can he want with me ? ” “ He wishes to speak to you . ” “ To me ? ” “ Yes . ” “ Did he mention my name ? ” “ Yes . ” “ What sort of person is he ? ” “ Why , sir , a man of about fifty . ” “ <unk> or tall ? ” “ About your own height , sir . ” “ <unk> or fair ? ” “ <unk> , — very dark ; with black eyes , black hair , black eyebrows . ” “ And how dressed ? ” asked Villefort quickly .
“ In a blue <unk> , <unk> up close , <unk> with the Legion of Honor . ” “ It is he ! ” said Villefort , turning pale .
<unk> “ <unk> , _ <unk> ! _ ” said the individual whose description we have twice given , entering the door , “ what a great deal of ceremony !
Is it the custom in Marseilles for <unk> to keep their fathers waiting in their <unk> ? ” “ Father ! ” cried Villefort , “ then I was not deceived ; I felt sure it must be you . ” “ Well , then , if you felt so sure , ” replied the <unk> , putting his cane in a corner and his hat on a chair , “ allow me to say , my dear <unk> , that it was not very <unk> of you to keep me waiting at the door . ” “ Leave us , <unk> , ” said Villefort .
The servant quitted the apartment with evident signs of astonishment .
Chapter <unk> .
Father and <unk> M. Noirtier — for it was , indeed , he who entered — looked after the servant until the door was closed , and then , fearing , no doubt , that he might be <unk> in the antechamber , he opened the door again , nor was the precaution useless , as appeared from the rapid retreat of <unk> , who proved that he was not exempt from the sin which ruined our first parents .
M. Noirtier then took the trouble to close and bolt the antechamber door , then that of the <unk> , and then extended his hand to Villefort , who had followed all his <unk> with surprise which he could not conceal .
“ Well , now , my dear <unk> , ” said he to the young man , with a very significant look , “ do you know , you seem as if you were not very glad to see me ? ” “ My dear father , ” said Villefort , “ I am , on the contrary , delighted ; but I so little expected your visit , that it has somewhat overcome me . ” “ But , my dear fellow , ” replied M. Noirtier , <unk> himself , “ I might say the same thing to you , when you announce to me your wedding for the <unk> of February , and on the <unk> of March you turn up here in Paris . ” “ And if I have come , my dear father , ” said <unk> , drawing closer to M. Noirtier , “ do not complain , for it is for you that I came , and my journey will be your <unk> . ” “ Ah , indeed ! ” said M. Noirtier , <unk> himself out at his ease in the chair .
“ Really , pray tell me all about it , for it must be interesting . ” “ Father , you have heard speak of a certain Bonapartist club in the Rue Saint-Jacques ? ” “ No .
<unk> ; yes , I am <unk> . ” “ Father , your coolness makes me shudder . ” “ Why , my dear boy , when a man has been <unk> by the <unk> , has escaped from Paris in a <unk> , been hunted over the <unk> of <unk> by <unk> ’ s <unk> , he becomes accustomed to most things .
But go on , what about the club in the Rue Saint-Jacques ? ” “ Why , they induced General <unk> to go there , and General <unk> , who quitted his own house at nine o ’ clock in the evening , was found the next day in the Seine . ” <unk> “ And who told you this fine story ? ” “ The king himself . ” “ Well , then , in return for your story , ” continued Noirtier , “ I will tell you another . ” “ My dear father , I think I already know what you are about to tell me . ” “ Ah , you have heard of the landing of the emperor ? ” “ Not so loud , father , I entreat of you — for your own sake as well as mine .
Yes , I heard this news , and knew it even before you could ; for three days ago I posted from Marseilles to Paris with all possible speed , <unk> at the <unk> delay . ” “ Three days ago ?
You are <unk> .
Why , three days ago the emperor had not landed . ” “ No matter , I was aware of his intention . ” “ How did you know about it ? ” “ By a letter addressed to you from the Island of Elba . ” “ To me ? ” “ To you ; and which I discovered in the pocket-book of the messenger .
Had that letter fallen into the hands of another , you , my dear father , would probably ere this have been shot . ” Villefort ’ s father laughed .
“ Come , come , ” said he , “ will the Restoration <unk> <unk> <unk> so <unk> ?
<unk> , my dear boy ?
What an idea !
Where is the letter you speak of ?
I know you too well to suppose you would allow such a thing to pass you . ” “ I burnt it , for fear that even a fragment should remain ; for that letter must have led to your <unk> . ” “ And the destruction of your future prospects , ” replied Noirtier ; “ yes , I can easily comprehend that .
But I have nothing to fear while I have you to protect me . ” “ I do better than that , sir — I save you . ” “ You do ?
Why , really , the thing becomes more and more <unk> — explain yourself . ” “ I must <unk> again to the club in the Rue Saint-Jacques . ” “ It appears that this club is rather a bore to the police .
Why didn ’ t they search more <unk> ?
they would have found — — ” “ They have not found ; but they are on the track . ” “ Yes , that the usual phrase ; I am quite familiar with it .
When the police is at fault , it <unk> that it is on the track ; and the government <unk> <unk> the day when it comes to say , with a <unk> air , that the track is lost . ” “ Yes , but they have found a corpse ; the general has been killed , and in all countries they call that a murder . ” “ A murder do you call it ?
why , there is nothing to prove that the general was murdered .
People are found every day in the Seine , having thrown themselves in , or having been <unk> from not knowing how to <unk> . ” “ Father , you know very well that the general was not a man to <unk> himself in despair , and people do not <unk> in the Seine in the month of <unk> .
No , no , do not be deceived ; this was murder in every sense of the word . ” “ And who thus designated it ? ” “ The king himself . ” “ The king !
I thought he was philosopher enough to allow that there was no murder in politics .
In politics , my dear fellow , you know , as well as I do , there are no men , but ideas — no feelings , but interests ; in politics we do not kill a man , we only remove an obstacle , that is all .
Would you like to know how matters have <unk> ?
Well , I will tell you .
It was thought <unk> might be placed in General <unk> ; he was recommended to us from the Island of Elba ; one of us went to him , and invited him to the Rue Saint-Jacques , where he would find some friends .
He came there , and the plan was unfolded to him for leaving Elba , the projected landing , etc .
When he had heard and comprehended all to the <unk> extent , he replied that he was a <unk> .
Then all looked at each other , — he was made to take an oath , and did so , but with such an ill grace that it was really <unk> Providence to swear thus , and yet , in spite of that , the general was allowed to depart free — perfectly free .
Yet he did not return home .
What could that mean ?
why , my dear fellow , that on leaving us he lost his way , that ’ s all .
A murder ?
really , Villefort , you surprise me .
You , a deputy procureur , to found an accusation on such bad <unk> !
Did I ever say to you , when you were <unk> your character as a <unk> , and cut off the head of one of my party , ‘ My son , you have committed a murder ? ’ No , I said , ‘ Very well , sir , you have gained the victory ; tomorrow , <unk> , it will be our turn . ’ ” “ But , father , take care ; when our turn comes , our revenge will be <unk> . ” “ I do not understand you . ” “ You rely on the usurper ’ s return ? ” “ We do . ” “ You are mistaken ; he will not advance two leagues into the interior of France without being followed , <unk> , and caught like a wild beast . ” “ My dear fellow , the emperor is at this moment on the way to <unk> ; on the <unk> or <unk> he will be at <unk> , and on the <unk> or <unk> at Paris . ” “ The people will rise . ” “ Yes , to go and meet him . ” “ He has but a handful of men with him , and <unk> will be <unk> against him . ” “ Yes , to <unk> him into the capital .
Really , my dear <unk> , you are but a child ; you think yourself well informed because the telegraph has told you , three days after the landing , ‘ The usurper has landed at <unk> with several men .
He is pursued . ’ But where is he ?
what is he doing ?
You do not know at all , and in this way they will <unk> him to Paris , without drawing a <unk> . ” “ <unk> and <unk> are faithful <unk> , and will oppose to him an <unk> barrier . ” “ <unk> will open her gates to him with enthusiasm — all <unk> will hasten to welcome him .
Believe me , we are as well informed as you , and our police are as good as your own .
Would you like a proof of it ?
well , you wished to conceal your journey from me , and yet I knew of your arrival half an hour after you had passed the barrier .
You gave your direction to no one but your <unk> , yet I have your address , and in proof I am here the very instant you are going to sit at table .
<unk> , then , if you please , for a second knife , <unk> , and plate , and we will dine together . ” “ Indeed ! ” replied Villefort , looking at his father with astonishment , “ you really do seem very well informed . ” “ <unk> ?
the thing is simple enough .
You who are in power have only the means that money produces — we who are in expectation , have those which devotion <unk> . ” “ <unk> ! ” said Villefort , with a <unk> .
“ Yes , devotion ; for that is , I believe , the phrase for <unk> ambition . ” And Villefort ’ s father extended his hand to the <unk> , to summon the servant whom his son had not called .
Villefort caught his arm .
“ Wait , my dear father , ” said the young man , “ one word more . ” “ Say on . ” “ However stupid the <unk> police may be , they do know one terrible thing . ” “ What is that ? ” “ The description of the man who , on the morning of the day when General <unk> disappeared , presented himself at his house . ” “ Oh , the admirable police have found that out , have they ?
And what may be that description ? ” “ <unk> complexion ; hair , eyebrows , and <unk> black ; blue <unk> , <unk> up to the chin ; <unk> of an officer of the Legion of Honor in his <unk> ; a hat with wide <unk> , and a cane . ” “ Ah , <unk> , that ’ s it , is it ? ” said Noirtier ; “ and why , then , have they not laid hands on him ? ” “ Because yesterday , or the day before , they lost sight of him at the corner of the Rue <unk> . ” “ <unk> ’ t I say that your police were good for nothing ? ” “ Yes ; but they may catch him yet . ” “ True , ” said Noirtier , looking <unk> around him , “ true , if this person were not on his guard , as he is ; ” and he added with a smile , “ He will consequently make a few changes in his personal appearance . ” At these words he rose , and put off his <unk> and cravat , went towards a table on which lay his son ’ s toilet <unk> , <unk> his face , took a <unk> , and , with a firm hand , cut off the <unk> <unk> .
Villefort watched him with alarm not <unk> of admiration .
His <unk> cut off , Noirtier gave another turn to his hair ; took , instead of his black cravat , a <unk> <unk> which lay at the top of an open <unk> ; put on , in lieu of his blue and <unk> <unk> , a coat of Villefort ’ s of dark brown , and cut away in front ; tried on before the glass a <unk> hat of his son ’ s , which appeared to fit him perfectly , and , leaving his cane in the corner where he had deposited it , he took up a small <unk> <unk> , cut the air with it once or twice , and walked about with that easy <unk> which was one of his principal <unk> .
“ Well , ” he said , turning towards his <unk> son , when this disguise was completed , “ well , do you think your police will recognize me now . ” “ No , father , ” stammered Villefort ; “ at least , I hope not . ” “ And now , my dear boy , ” continued Noirtier , “ I rely on your prudence to remove all the things which I leave in your care . ” “ Oh , rely on me , ” said Villefort .
“ Yes , yes ; and now I believe you are right , and that you have really saved my life ; be assured I will return the favor <unk> . ” Villefort shook his head .
“ You are not convinced yet ? ” “ I hope at least , that you may be mistaken . ” “ Shall you see the king again ? ” “ Perhaps . ” “ Would you pass in his eyes for a <unk> ? ” “ <unk> of evil are not in favor at the court , father . ” “ True , but some day they do them justice ; and supposing a second <unk> , you would then pass for a great man . ” “ Well , what should I say to the king ? ” “ Say this to him : ‘ Sire , you are deceived as to the feeling in France , as to the opinions of the <unk> , and the prejudices of the army ; he whom in Paris you call the Corsican <unk> , who at <unk> is <unk> the usurper , is already <unk> as Bonaparte at <unk> , and emperor at <unk> .
You think he is <unk> , pursued , captured ; he is advancing as rapidly as his own <unk> .
The soldiers you believe to be dying with hunger , worn out with fatigue , ready to desert , <unk> like <unk> of snow about the rolling ball as it <unk> <unk> .
Sire , go , leave France to its real master , to him who acquired it , not by purchase , but by right of <unk> ; go , sire , not that you <unk> any risk , for your <unk> is powerful enough to show you mercy , but because it would be <unk> for a <unk> of Saint Louis to owe his life to the man of <unk> , <unk> , Austerlitz . ’ Tell him this , <unk> ; or , rather , tell him nothing .
<unk> your journey a secret ; do not boast of what you have come to Paris to do , or have done ; return with all speed ; enter Marseilles at night , and your house by the <unk> , and there remain , quiet , <unk> , secret , and , above all , <unk> ; for this time , I swear to you , we shall act like powerful men who know their enemies .
Go , my son — go , my dear <unk> , and by your obedience to my paternal orders , or , if you prefer it , friendly <unk> , we will keep you in your place .
This will be , ” added Noirtier , with a smile , “ one means by which you may a second time save me , if the political balance should some day take another turn , and cast you <unk> while <unk> me down .
Adieu , my dear <unk> , and at your next journey <unk> at my door . ” Noirtier left the room when he had finished , with the same calmness that had <unk> him during the whole of this remarkable and trying conversation .
Villefort , pale and agitated , ran to the window , put aside the curtain , and saw him pass , cool and collected , by two or three <unk> men at the corner of the street , who were there , perhaps , to arrest a man with black <unk> , and a blue <unk> , and hat with broad <unk> .
Villefort stood watching , breathless , until his father had disappeared at the Rue <unk> .
Then he turned to the various <unk> he had left behind him , put the black cravat and blue <unk> at the bottom of the <unk> , threw the hat into a dark <unk> , broke the cane into small <unk> and flung it in the fire , put on his <unk> , and calling his valet , <unk> with a look the thousand questions he was ready to ask , paid his bill , sprang into his carriage , which was ready , learned at <unk> that Bonaparte had entered <unk> , and in the midst of the tumult which prevailed along the road , at length reached Marseilles , a prey to all the hopes and fears which enter into the heart of man with ambition and its first <unk> .
Chapter <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> M. Noirtier was a true <unk> , and things <unk> rapidly , as he had <unk> .
<unk> knows the history of the famous return from Elba , a return which was <unk> in the past , and will probably remain without a <unk> in the future .
Louis XVIII .
made but a faint attempt to <unk> this unexpected blow ; the monarchy he had scarcely <unk> <unk> on its <unk> foundation , and at a sign from the emperor the <unk> <unk> of ancient prejudices and new ideas fell to the ground .
Villefort , therefore , gained nothing save the king ’ s gratitude ( which was rather likely to <unk> him at the present time ) and the cross of the Legion of Honor , which he had the prudence not to wear , although M. de Blacas had <unk> <unk> the <unk> .
Napoleon would , doubtless , have deprived Villefort of his office had it not been for Noirtier , who was all powerful at court , and thus the <unk> of ’ 93 and the <unk> of <unk> protected him who so lately had been his protector .
All Villefort ’ s influence barely enabled him to <unk> the secret Dantès had so nearly <unk> .
The king ’ s procureur alone was deprived of his office , being suspected of <unk> .
However , scarcely was the <unk> power established — that is , scarcely had the emperor re-entered the Tuileries and begun to issue orders from the <unk> into which we have introduced our <unk> , — he found on the table there Louis XVIII . ’ s <unk> <unk> , — scarcely had this occurred when Marseilles began , in spite of the authorities , to <unk> the flames of civil war , always <unk> in the south , and it required but little to excite the populace to <unk> of far greater violence than the shouts and <unk> with which they <unk> the <unk> whenever they ventured abroad .
<unk> <unk> to this change , the worthy <unk> became at that moment — we will not say all powerful , because Morrel was a prudent and rather a timid man , so much so , that many of the most <unk> <unk> of Bonaparte accused him of “ <unk> ” — but sufficiently <unk> to make a demand in favor of Dantès .
Villefort retained his place , but his marriage was put off until a more favorable opportunity .
If the emperor remained on the throne , <unk> required a different alliance to aid his career ; if Louis XVIII .
returned , the influence of M. de Saint-Méran , like his own , could be <unk> increased , and the marriage be still more suitable .
The deputy procureur was , therefore , the first magistrate of Marseilles , when one morning his door opened , and M. Morrel was announced .
<unk> else would have hastened to receive him ; but Villefort was a man of <unk> , and he knew this would be a sign of weakness .
He made Morrel wait in the antechamber , although he had no one with him , for the simple reason that the king ’ s procureur always makes everyone wait , and after passing a quarter of an hour in reading the papers , he ordered M. Morrel to be admitted .
Morrel expected Villefort would be <unk> ; he found him as he had found him six weeks before , calm , firm , and full of that <unk> politeness , that most <unk> barrier which <unk> the <unk> from the vulgar man .
He had entered Villefort ’ s office expecting that the magistrate would tremble at the sight of him ; on the contrary , he felt a cold shudder all over him when he saw Villefort sitting there with his elbow on his desk , and his head leaning on his hand .
He stopped at the door ; Villefort gazed at him as if he had some difficulty in <unk> him ; then , after a brief interval , during which the honest <unk> turned his hat in his hands , “ M.
Morrel , I believe ? ” said Villefort .
“ Yes , sir . ” “ Come nearer , ” said the magistrate , with a <unk> wave of the hand , “ and tell me to what circumstance I owe the honor of this visit . ” “ Do you not guess , monsieur ? ” asked Morrel .
“ Not in the least ; but if I can serve you in any way I shall be delighted . ” “ Everything depends on you . ” “ <unk> yourself , pray . ” “ Monsieur , ” said Morrel , <unk> his assurance as he proceeded , “ do you recollect that a few days before the landing of his majesty the emperor , I came to <unk> for a young man , the mate of my ship , who was accused of being concerned in <unk> with the Island of Elba ?
What was the other day a crime is today a title to favor .
You then served Louis XVIII . , and you did not show any favor — it was your duty ; today you serve Napoleon , and you ought to protect him — it is equally your duty ; I come , therefore , to ask what has become of him ? ” <unk> Villefort by a strong effort sought to <unk> himself .
“ What is his name ? ” said he .
“ Tell me his name . ” “ Edmond Dantès . ” Villefort would probably have rather stood opposite the <unk> of a pistol at <unk> paces than have heard this name spoken ; but he did not <unk> .
“ Dantès , ” repeated he , “ Edmond Dantès . ” “ Yes , monsieur . ” Villefort opened a large <unk> , then went to a table , from the table turned to his <unk> , and then , turning to Morrel , “ Are you quite sure you are not mistaken , monsieur ? ” said he , in the most natural tone in the world .
Had Morrel been a more <unk> man , or better <unk> in these matters , he would have been surprised at the king ’ s procureur answering him on such a subject , instead of <unk> him to the <unk> of the prison or the prefect of the <unk> .
But Morrel , disappointed in his <unk> of <unk> fear , was conscious only of the other ’ s <unk> .
Villefort had calculated rightly .
“ No , ” said Morrel ; “ I am not mistaken .
I have known him for ten years , the last four of which he was in my service .
Do not you recollect , I came about six weeks ago to <unk> for <unk> , as I come today to <unk> for justice .
You received me very coldly .
Oh , the <unk> were very severe with the <unk> in those days . ” “ Monsieur , ” returned Villefort , “ I was then a <unk> , because I believed the <unk> not only the <unk> to the throne , but the chosen of the nation .
The <unk> return of Napoleon has conquered me , the <unk> <unk> is he who is loved by his people . ” “ That ’ s right ! ” cried Morrel .
“ I like to hear you speak thus , and I <unk> well for Edmond from it . ” “ Wait a moment , ” said Villefort , turning over the leaves of a <unk> ; “ I have it — a sailor , who was about to marry a young <unk> girl .
I recollect now ; it was a very serious charge . ” “ How so ? ” “ You know that when he left here he was taken to the <unk> de <unk> . ” “ Well ? ” “ I made my report to the authorities at Paris , and a week after he was carried off . ” “ <unk> off ! ” said Morrel .
“ What can they have done with him ? ” “ Oh , he has been taken to <unk> , to <unk> , or to the <unk> <unk> .
Some fine morning he will return to take command of your vessel . ” “ Come when he will , it shall be kept for him .
But how is it he is not already returned ?
It seems to me the first care of government should be to set at liberty those who have suffered for their <unk> to it . ” “ Do not be too hasty , M. Morrel , ” replied Villefort .
“ The order of <unk> came from high authority , and the order for his <unk> must proceed from the same source ; and , as Napoleon has scarcely been <unk> a fortnight , the letters have not yet been <unk> . ” “ But , ” said Morrel , “ is there no way of <unk> all these <unk> — of <unk> him from arrest ? ” “ There has been no arrest . ” “ How ? ” “ It is sometimes <unk> to government to cause a man ’ s disappearance without leaving any traces , so that no written forms or documents may <unk> their wishes . ” “ It might be so under the <unk> , but at present — — ” “ It has always been so , my dear Morrel , since the <unk> of Louis <unk> .
The emperor is more strict in prison <unk> than even Louis himself , and the number of prisoners whose names are not on the <unk> is <unk> . ” Had Morrel even any suspicions , so much kindness would have <unk> them .
“ Well , M. de Villefort , how would you advise me to act ? ” asked he .
“ <unk> the minister . ” “ Oh , I know what that is ; the minister <unk> two hundred <unk> every day , and does not read three . ” “ That is true ; but he will read a <unk> <unk> and presented by me . ” “ And will you <unk> to deliver it ? ” “ With the greatest pleasure .
Dantès was then guilty , and now he is innocent , and it is as much my duty to free him as it was to <unk> him . ” Villefort thus <unk> any danger of an inquiry , which , however <unk> it might be , if it did take place would leave him <unk> .
“ But how shall I address the minister ? ” “ <unk> down there , ” said Villefort , giving up his place to Morrel , “ and write what I <unk> . ” “ Will you be so good ? ” “ Certainly .
But lose no time ; we have lost too much already . ” “ That is true .
Only think what the poor fellow may even now be suffering . ” Villefort shuddered at the <unk> ; but he had gone too far to draw back .
Dantès must be crushed to <unk> Villefort ’ s ambition .
Villefort <unk> a <unk> , in which , from an excellent intention , no doubt , Dantès ’ <unk> services were <unk> , and he was made out one of the most active agents of Napoleon ’ s return .
It was evident that at the sight of this <unk> the minister would instantly <unk> him .
The <unk> finished , Villefort read it aloud .
“ That will do , ” said he ; “ leave the rest to me . ” “ Will the <unk> go soon ? ” “ <unk> . ” “ <unk> by you ? ” “ The best thing I can do will be to <unk> the truth of the contents of your <unk> . ” And , sitting down , Villefort wrote the <unk> at the bottom .
“ What more is to be done ? ” “ I will do whatever is necessary . ” This assurance delighted Morrel , who took leave of Villefort , and hastened to announce to old Dantès that he would soon see his son .
As for Villefort , instead of sending to Paris , he carefully preserved the <unk> that so <unk> <unk> Dantès , in the hopes of an event that seemed not <unk> , — that is , a second <unk> .
Dantès remained a prisoner , and heard not the noise of the fall of Louis XVIII . ’ s throne , or the still more tragic destruction of the <unk> .
<unk> during the <unk> <unk> had Morrel renewed his demand , and twice had Villefort <unk> him with promises .
At last there was Waterloo , and Morrel came no more ; he had done all that was in his power , and any fresh attempt would only <unk> himself <unk> .
Louis XVIII .
<unk> the throne ; Villefort , to whom Marseilles had become filled with <unk> memories , sought and obtained the situation of king ’ s procureur at <unk> , and a fortnight afterwards he married Mademoiselle de Saint-Méran , whose father now stood higher at court than ever .
And so Dantès , after the <unk> <unk> and after Waterloo , remained in his dungeon , forgotten of earth and heaven .
Danglars comprehended the full extent of the wretched fate that overwhelmed Dantès ; and , when Napoleon returned to France , he , after the manner of <unk> minds , <unk> the <unk> , _ a <unk> of Providence _ .
But when Napoleon returned to Paris , Danglars ’ heart failed him , and he lived in constant fear of Dantès ’ return on a mission of vengeance .
He therefore informed M. Morrel of his wish to quit the sea , and obtained a <unk> from him to a Spanish merchant , into whose service he entered at the end of March , that is , ten or twelve days after Napoleon ’ s return .
He then left for <unk> , and was no more heard of .
Fernand understood nothing except that Dantès was absent .
What had become of him he cared not to inquire .
Only , during the <unk> the absence of his <unk> afforded him , he reflected , partly on the means of <unk> Mercédès as to the cause of his absence , partly on plans of <unk> and <unk> , as from time to time he sat sad and motionless on the summit of <unk> <unk> , at the spot from whence Marseilles and the Catalans are visible , watching for the apparition of a young and handsome man , who was for him also the messenger of vengeance .
Fernand ’ s mind was made up ; he would <unk> Dantès , and then kill himself .
But Fernand was mistaken ; a man of his disposition never <unk> himself , for he constantly hopes .
During this time the <unk> made its last <unk> , and every man in France capable of bearing arms rushed to obey the <unk> of the emperor .
Fernand departed with the rest , bearing with him the terrible thought that while he was away , his <unk> would perhaps return and marry Mercédès .
Had Fernand really meant to kill himself , he would have done so when he parted from Mercédès .
His devotion , and the compassion he showed for her misfortunes , produced the effect they always produce on noble minds — Mercédès had always had a sincere regard for Fernand , and this was now <unk> by gratitude .
“ My brother , ” said she , as she placed his <unk> on his shoulders , “ be careful of yourself , for if you are killed , I shall be alone in the world . ” These words carried a ray of hope into Fernand ’ s heart .
Should Dantès not return , Mercédès might one day be his .
<unk> Mercédès was left alone face to face with the vast plain that had never seemed so <unk> , and the sea that had never seemed so vast .
<unk> in tears she wandered about the <unk> village .
Sometimes she stood mute and motionless as a statue , looking towards Marseilles , at other times gazing on the sea , and <unk> as to whether it were not better to cast herself into the abyss of the ocean , and thus end her <unk> .
It was not want of courage that prevented her putting this resolution into execution ; but her religious feelings came to her aid and saved her .
Caderousse was , like Fernand , <unk> in the army , but , being married and eight years older , he was merely sent to the <unk> .
Old Dantès , who was only sustained by hope , lost all hope at Napoleon ’ s <unk> .
Five months after he had been separated from his son , and almost at the hour of his arrest , he breathed his last in Mercédès ’ arms .
M. Morrel paid the expenses of his funeral , and a few small debts the poor old man had contracted .
There was more than <unk> in this action ; there was courage ; the south was <unk> , and to assist , even on his <unk> , the father of so dangerous a Bonapartist as Dantès , was <unk> as a crime .
Chapter <unk> .
The Two <unk> A year after Louis XVIII . ’ s <unk> , a visit was made by the <unk> of prisons .
Dantès in his cell heard the noise of preparation , — sounds that at the depth where he lay would have been <unk> to any but the ear of a prisoner , who could hear the <unk> of the drop of water that every hour fell from the roof of his dungeon .
He guessed something <unk> was passing among the living ; but he had so long ceased to have any intercourse with the world , that he looked upon himself as dead .
The inspector visited , one after another , the <unk> and <unk> of several of the prisoners , whose good <unk> or <unk> recommended them to the <unk> of the government .
He inquired how they were <unk> , and if they had any request to make .
The universal <unk> was , that the <unk> was <unk> , and that they wanted to be set free .
The inspector asked if they had anything else to ask for .
They shook their heads .
What could they desire beyond their liberty ?
The inspector turned <unk> to the governor .
“ I do not know what reason government can <unk> for these useless visits ; when you see one prisoner , you see all , — always the same thing , — ill <unk> and innocent .
Are there any others ? ” “ Yes ; the dangerous and mad prisoners are in the <unk> . ” “ Let us visit them , ” said the inspector with an air of fatigue .
“ We must play the <unk> to the end .
Let us see the <unk> . ” “ Let us first send for two soldiers , ” said the governor .
“ The prisoners sometimes , through mere uneasiness of life , and in order to be <unk> to death , commit <unk> of useless violence , and you might fall a victim . ” “ Take all <unk> precautions , ” replied the inspector .
Two soldiers were accordingly sent for , and the inspector descended a <unk> , so foul , so <unk> , so dark , as to be <unk> to sight , smell , and <unk> .
“ Oh , ” cried the inspector , “ who can live here ? ” “ A most dangerous <unk> , a man we are ordered to keep the most strict watch over , as he is daring and resolute . ” “ He is alone ? ” “ Certainly . ” “ How long has he been there ? ” “ Nearly a year . ” “ Was he placed here when he first arrived ? ” “ No ; not until he attempted to kill the turnkey , who took his food to him . ” “ To kill the turnkey ? ” “ Yes , the very one who is <unk> us .
Is it not true , <unk> ? ” asked the governor .
“ True enough ; he wanted to kill me ! ” returned the turnkey .
“ He must be mad , ” said the inspector .
“ He is worse than that , — he is a devil ! ” returned the turnkey .
“ Shall I complain of him ? ” demanded the inspector .
“ Oh , no ; it is useless .
Besides , he is almost mad now , and in another year he will be quite so . ” “ So much the better for him , — he will suffer less , ” said the inspector .
He was , as this remark shows , a man full of <unk> , and in every way fit for his office .
“ You are right , sir , ” replied the governor ; “ and this remark <unk> that you have deeply considered the subject .
Now we have in a dungeon about twenty feet distant , and to which you descend by another <unk> , an old abbé , formerly leader of a party in Italy , who has been here since <unk> , and in <unk> he went mad , and the change is astonishing .
He used to weep , he now <unk> ; he grew thin , he now grows fat .
You had better see him , for his madness is amusing . ” “ I will see them both , ” returned the inspector ; “ I must <unk> perform my duty . ” This was the inspector ’ s first visit ; he wished to display his authority .
“ Let us visit this one first , ” added he .
“ By all means , ” replied the governor , and he signed to the turnkey to open the door .
At the sound of the key turning in the lock , and the <unk> of the hinges , Dantès , who was <unk> in a corner of the dungeon , whence he could see the ray of light that came through a narrow iron grating above , raised his head .
<unk> a stranger , <unk> by two <unk> holding <unk> and accompanied by two soldiers , and to whom the governor spoke <unk> , Dantès , who guessed the truth , and that the moment to address himself to the superior authorities was come , sprang forward with clasped hands .
The soldiers <unk> their bayonets , for they thought that he was about to attack the inspector , and the latter recoiled two or three steps .
Dantès saw that he was looked upon as dangerous .
Then , <unk> all the <unk> he possessed into his eyes and voice , he addressed the inspector , and sought to inspire him with pity .
The inspector listened attentively ; then , turning to the governor , observed , “ He will become religious — he is already more gentle ; he is afraid , and retreated before the bayonets — <unk> are not afraid of anything ; I made some curious <unk> on this at <unk> . ” Then , turning to the prisoner , “ What is it you want ? ” said he .
“ I want to know what crime I have committed — to be tried ; and if I am guilty , to be shot ; if innocent , to be set at liberty . ” “ Are you well <unk> ? ” said the inspector .
“ I believe so ; I don ’ t know ; it ’ s of no consequence .
What matters really , not only to me , but to officers of justice and the king , is that an innocent man should <unk> in prison , the victim of an infamous <unk> , to die here <unk> his <unk> . ” “ You are very humble today , ” remarked the governor ; “ you are not so always ; the other day , for instance , when you tried to kill the turnkey . ” “ It is true , sir , and I beg his pardon , for he has always been very good to me , but I was mad . ” “ And you are not so any longer ? ” “ No ; <unk> has <unk> me — I have been here so long . ” “ So long ? — when were you arrested , then ? ” asked the inspector .
“ The <unk> of February , 1815 , at half-past two in the afternoon . ” “ <unk> is the <unk> of July , <unk> , — why , it is but seventeen months . ” “ Only seventeen months , ” replied Dantès .
“ Oh , you do not know what is seventeen months in prison ! — seventeen <unk> rather , especially to a man who , like me , had arrived at the summit of his ambition — to a man , who , like me , was on the point of marrying a woman he adored , who saw an honorable career opened before him , and who <unk> all in an instant — who sees his prospects destroyed , and is ignorant of the fate of his <unk> wife , and whether his aged father be still living !
<unk> months ’ <unk> to a sailor accustomed to the <unk> ocean , is a worse punishment than human crime ever <unk> .
Have pity on me , then , and ask for me , not intelligence , but a trial ; not pardon , but a <unk> — a trial , sir , I ask only for a trial ; that , surely , cannot be denied to one who is accused ! ” “ We shall see , ” said the inspector ; then , turning to the governor , “ On my word , the poor devil <unk> me .
You must show me the proofs against him . ” “ Certainly ; but you will find terrible <unk> . ” “ Monsieur , ” continued Dantès , “ I know it is not in your power to <unk> me ; but you can <unk> for me — you can have me tried — and that is all I ask .
Let me know my crime , and the reason why I was condemned .
<unk> is worse than all . ” “ Go on with the lights , ” said the inspector .
“ Monsieur , ” cried Dantès , “ I can tell by your voice you are touched with pity ; tell me at least to hope . ” “ I cannot tell you that , ” replied the inspector ; “ I can only promise to examine into your case . ” “ Oh , I am free — then I am saved ! ” “ Who arrested you ? ” “ M.
Villefort .
See him , and hear what he says . ” “ M.
Villefort is no longer at Marseilles ; he is now at <unk> . ” “ I am no longer surprised at my <unk> , ” murmured Dantès , “ since my only protector is removed . ” “ Had M. de Villefort any cause of personal dislike to you ? ” “ None ; on the contrary , he was very kind to me . ” “ I can , then , rely on the notes he has left concerning you ? ” “ <unk> . ” “ That is well ; wait <unk> , then . ” Dantès fell on his knees , and <unk> earnestly .
The door closed ; but this time a fresh <unk> was left with Dantès — <unk> .
<unk> “ Will you see the <unk> at once , ” asked the governor , “ or proceed to the other cell ? ” “ Let us visit them all , ” said the inspector .
“ If I once went up those stairs .
I should never have the courage to come down again . ” “ Ah , this one is not like the other , and his madness is less <unk> than this one ’ s display of reason . ” “ What is his folly ? ” “ He fancies he possesses an immense treasure .
The first year he offered government a million of francs for his <unk> ; the second , two ; the third , three ; and so on <unk> .
He is now in his fifth year of <unk> ; he will ask to speak to you in private , and offer you five millions . ” “ How curious ! — what is his name ? ” “ The Abbé Faria . ” “ No .
<unk> , ” said the inspector .
“ It is here ; <unk> the door , <unk> . ” The turnkey obeyed , and the inspector gazed <unk> into the chamber of the _ mad abbé _ , as the prisoner was usually called .
In the centre of the cell , in a circle traced with a fragment of plaster detached from the wall , sat a man whose <unk> garments scarcely covered him .
He was drawing in this circle <unk> lines , and seemed as much absorbed in his problem as <unk> was when the soldier of <unk> <unk> him .
He did not move at the sound of the door , and continued his <unk> until the flash of the <unk> lighted up with an <unk> <unk> the sombre walls of his cell ; then , raising his head , he perceived with astonishment the number of persons present .
He hastily seized the <unk> of his bed , and wrapped it round him .
“ What is it you want ? ” said the inspector .
“ I , monsieur , ” replied the abbé with an air of surprise , — “ I want nothing . ” “ You do not understand , ” continued the inspector ; “ I am sent here by government to visit the prison , and hear the <unk> of the prisoners . ” “ Oh , that is different , ” cried the abbé ; “ and we shall understand each other , I hope . ” “ There , now , ” whispered the governor , “ it is just as I told you . ” “ Monsieur , ” continued the prisoner , “ I am the Abbé Faria , born at Rome .
I was for twenty years Cardinal Spada ’ s secretary ; I was arrested , why , I know not , toward the beginning of the year <unk> ; since then I have demanded my liberty from the Italian and French government . ” “ Why from the French government ? ” “ Because I was arrested at <unk> , and I presume that , like <unk> and <unk> , <unk> has become the capital of some French <unk> . ” “ Ah , ” said the inspector , “ you have not the <unk> news from Italy ? ” “ My information <unk> from the day on which I was arrested , ” returned the Abbé Faria ; “ and as the emperor had created the <unk> of Rome for his infant son , I presume that he has realized the dream of <unk> and Cæsar <unk> , which was to make Italy a united <unk> . ” “ Monsieur , ” returned the inspector , “ Providence has changed this gigantic plan you <unk> so warmly . ” “ It is the only means of <unk> Italy strong , happy , and independent . ” “ Very possibly ; only I am not come to <unk> politics , but to inquire if you have anything to ask or to complain of . ” “ The food is the same as in other prisons , — that is , very bad ; the <unk> is very <unk> , but , on the whole , <unk> for a dungeon ; but it is not that which I wish to speak of , but a secret I have to reveal of the greatest importance . ” “ We are coming to the point , ” whispered the governor .
“ It is for that reason I am delighted to see you , ” continued the abbé , “ although you have disturbed me in a most important <unk> , which , if it succeeded , would possibly change <unk> ’ s system .
Could you allow me a few words in private . ” “ What did I tell you ? ” said the governor .
“ You knew him , ” returned the inspector with a smile .
“ What you ask is impossible , monsieur , ” continued he , addressing Faria .
<unk> “ But , ” said the abbé , “ I would speak to you of a large sum , <unk> to five millions . ” “ The very sum you named , ” whispered the inspector in his turn .
“ However , ” continued Faria , seeing that the inspector was about to depart , “ it is not absolutely necessary for us to be alone ; the governor can be present . ” “ <unk> , ” said the governor , “ I know beforehand what you are about to say ; it concerns your treasures , does it not ? ” Faria fixed his eyes on him with an expression that would have convinced anyone else of his <unk> .
“ Of course , ” said he ; “ of what else should I speak ? ” “ Mr.
<unk> , ” continued the governor , “ I can tell you the story as well as he , for it has been <unk> in my ears for the last four or five years . ” “ That <unk> , ” returned the abbé , “ that you are like those of Holy <unk> , who having eyes see not , and having ears hear not . ” “ My dear sir , the government is rich and does not want your treasures , ” replied the inspector ; “ keep them until you are <unk> . ” The abbé ’ s eyes <unk> ; he seized the inspector ’ s hand .
“ But what if I am not <unk> , ” cried he , “ and am <unk> here until my death ?
this treasure will be lost .
Had not government better profit by it ?
I will offer six millions , and I will content myself with the rest , if they will only give me my liberty . ” “ On my word , ” said the inspector in a low tone , “ had I not been told beforehand that this man was mad , I should believe what he says . ” “ I am not mad , ” replied Faria , with that <unk> of hearing peculiar to prisoners .
“ The treasure I speak of really exists , and I offer to sign an agreement with you , in which I promise to lead you to the spot where you shall <unk> ; and if I deceive you , bring me here again , — I ask no more . ” The governor laughed .
“ Is the spot far from here ? ” “ A hundred leagues . ” “ It is not <unk> , ” said the governor .
“ If all the prisoners took it into their heads to travel a hundred leagues , and their <unk> <unk> to accompany them , they would have a capital chance of <unk> . ” “ The scheme is well known , ” said the inspector ; “ and the abbé ’ s plan has not even the merit of <unk> . ” Then turning to Faria , “ I inquired if you are well <unk> ? ” said he .
“ <unk> to me , ” replied Faria , “ to free me if what I tell you prove true , and I will stay here while you go to the spot . ” “ Are you well <unk> ? ” repeated the inspector .
“ Monsieur , you run no risk , for , as I told you , I will stay here ; so there is no chance of my <unk> . ” “ You do not reply to my question , ” replied the inspector impatiently .
“ Nor you to mine , ” cried the abbé .
“ You will not accept my gold ; I will keep it for myself .
You refuse me my liberty ; God will give it me . ” And the abbé , casting away his <unk> , resumed his place , and continued his <unk> .
<unk> “ What is he doing there ? ” said the inspector .
“ <unk> his treasures , ” replied the governor .
Faria replied to this <unk> with a glance of profound contempt .
They went out .
The turnkey closed the door behind them .
“ He was wealthy once , perhaps ? ” said the inspector .
“ Or dreamed he was , and awoke mad . ” “ After all , ” said the inspector , “ if he had been rich , he would not have been here . ” So the matter ended for the Abbé Faria .
He remained in his cell , and this visit only increased the belief in his <unk> .
<unk> or <unk> , those <unk> , those <unk> of the impossible , would have <unk> to the poor wretch , in exchange for his wealth , the liberty he so earnestly <unk> for .
But the kings of modern times , restrained by the <unk> of mere probability , have neither courage nor desire .
They fear the ear that hears their orders , and the eye that <unk> their actions .
<unk> they believed themselves sprung from <unk> , and <unk> by their birth ; but nowadays they are not <unk> .
It has always been against the <unk> of <unk> <unk> to suffer the <unk> of their <unk> to <unk> .
As the <unk> rarely allowed its <unk> to be seen with their limbs <unk> and their flesh <unk> by torture , so madness is always concealed in its cell , from whence , should it depart , it is conveyed to some gloomy hospital , where the doctor has no thought for man or mind in the <unk> being the jailer <unk> to him .
The very madness of the Abbé Faria , gone mad in prison , condemned him to <unk> <unk> .
The inspector kept his word with Dantès ; he examined the <unk> , and found the following note concerning him : _ Edmond Dantès : _ <unk> Bonapartist ; took an active part in the return from Elba .
The greatest <unk> and care to be exercised .
This note was in a different hand from the rest , which showed that it had been added since his <unk> .
The inspector could not <unk> against this accusation ; he simply wrote , _ Nothing to be done . _ This visit had <unk> new <unk> into Dantès ; he had , till then , forgotten the date ; but now , with a fragment of plaster , he wrote the date , <unk> July , <unk> , and made a mark every day , in order not to lose his <unk> again .
<unk> and weeks passed away , then months — Dantès still waited ; he at first expected to be <unk> in a fortnight .
This fortnight <unk> , he decided that the inspector would do nothing until his return to Paris , and that he would not reach there until his <unk> was finished , he therefore fixed three months ; three months passed away , then six more .
Finally ten months and a half had gone by and no favorable change had taken place , and Dantès began to fancy the inspector ’ s visit but a dream , an <unk> of the brain .
At the expiration of a year the governor was <unk> ; he had obtained charge of the <unk> at <unk> .
He took with him several of his <unk> , and amongst them Dantès ’ jailer .
A new governor arrived ; it would have been too <unk> to <unk> the names of the prisoners ; he learned their numbers instead .
This horrible place contained fifty <unk> ; their inhabitants were designated by the numbers of their cell , and the unhappy young man was no longer called Edmond Dantès — he was now number <unk> .
Chapter <unk> .
<unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> Dantès passed through all the <unk> of torture natural to prisoners in suspense .
He was sustained at first by that pride of conscious innocence which is the <unk> to hope ; then he began to doubt his own innocence , which <unk> in some measure the governor ’ s belief in his mental <unk> ; and then , <unk> his sentiment of pride , he addressed his <unk> , not to God , but to man .
God is always the last resource .
<unk> , who ought to begin with God , do not have any hope in him till they have exhausted all other means of <unk> .
Dantès asked to be removed from his present dungeon into another , even if it were <unk> and deeper , for a change , however <unk> , was still a change , and would afford him some amusement .
He <unk> to be allowed to walk about , to have fresh air , books , and writing <unk> .
His <unk> were not granted , but he went on asking all the same .
He accustomed himself to speaking to the new jailer , although the latter was , if possible , more <unk> than the old one ; but still , to speak to a man , even though mute , was something .
Dantès spoke for the sake of hearing his own voice ; he had tried to speak when alone , but the sound of his voice terrified him .
<unk> , before his <unk> , Dantès ’ mind had <unk> at the idea of <unk> of prisoners , made up of thieves , <unk> , and <unk> .
He now wished to be amongst them , in order to see some other face besides that of his jailer ; he sighed for the galleys , with the infamous costume , the chain , and the <unk> on the shoulder .
The <unk> breathed the fresh air of heaven , and saw each other .
They were very happy .
He <unk> the jailer one day to let him have a companion , were it even the mad abbé .
The jailer , though rough and <unk> by the constant sight of so much suffering , was yet a man .
At the bottom of his heart he had often had a feeling of pity for this unhappy young man who suffered so ; and he laid the request of number <unk> before the governor ; but the latter <unk> imagined that Dantès wished to <unk> or attempt an escape , and refused his request .
Dantès had exhausted all human resources , and he then turned to God .
All the <unk> ideas that had been so long forgotten , returned ; he recollected the prayers his mother had taught him , and discovered a new meaning in every word ; for in prosperity prayers seem but a mere <unk> of words , until misfortune comes and the unhappy <unk> first <unk> the meaning of the sublime language in which he <unk> the pity of heaven !
He <unk> , and <unk> aloud , no longer terrified at the sound of his own voice , for he fell into a sort of ecstasy .
He laid every action of his life before the <unk> , proposed <unk> to accomplish , and at the end of every prayer introduced the <unk> <unk> addressed to man than to God : “ <unk> us our <unk> as we forgive them that <unk> against us . ” Yet in spite of his earnest prayers , Dantès remained a prisoner .
Then gloom settled heavily upon him .
Dantès was a man of great simplicity of thought , and without education ; he could not , therefore , in the solitude of his dungeon , traverse in mental vision the history of the <unk> , bring to life the nations that had <unk> , and <unk> the ancient <unk> so vast and <unk> in the light of the imagination , and that pass before the eye <unk> with celestial colors in Martin ’ s <unk> <unk> .
He could not do this , he whose past life was so short , whose present so melancholy , and his future so doubtful .
<unk> years of light to reflect upon in eternal darkness !
No <unk> could come to his aid ; his energetic spirit , that would have <unk> in thus <unk> the past , was <unk> like an eagle in a <unk> .
He clung to one idea — that of his happiness , destroyed , without apparent cause , by an <unk> fatality ; he considered and <unk> this idea , <unk> it ( so to speak ) , as the <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> .
<unk> <unk> religious <unk> .
Dantès uttered <unk> that made his jailer <unk> with horror , dashed himself <unk> against the walls of his prison , <unk> his anger upon everything , and chiefly upon himself , so that the least thing , — a <unk> of sand , a straw , or a breath of air that <unk> him , led to <unk> of fury .
Then the letter that Villefort had showed to him recurred to his mind , and every line <unk> forth in <unk> letters on the wall like the _ <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> _ of <unk> .
He told himself that it was the <unk> of man , and not the vengeance of Heaven , that had thus plunged him into the <unk> misery .
He <unk> his unknown <unk> to the most horrible <unk> he could imagine , and found them all <unk> , because after torture came death , and after death , if not repose , at least the <unk> of <unk> .
By dint of constantly dwelling on the idea that tranquillity was death , and if punishment were the end in view other <unk> than death must be invented , he began to reflect on suicide .
<unk> he , who , on the brink of misfortune , <unk> over ideas like these !
Before him is a dead sea that <unk> in azure calm before the eye ; but he who <unk> <unk> within its embrace finds himself <unk> with a monster that would drag him down to <unk> .
Once thus <unk> , unless the <unk> hand of God <unk> him thence , all is over , and his <unk> but <unk> to hasten his destruction .
This state of mental anguish is , however , less terrible than the sufferings that <unk> or the punishment that possibly will follow .
There is a sort of consolation at the contemplation of the <unk> abyss , at the bottom of which lie darkness and obscurity .
Edmond found some <unk> in these ideas .
All his sorrows , all his sufferings , with their train of gloomy <unk> , fled from his cell when the angel of death seemed about to enter .
Dantès <unk> his past life with composure , and , looking forward with terror to his future existence , chose that middle line that seemed to afford him a refuge .
“ Sometimes , ” said he , “ in my <unk> , when I was a man and commanded other men , I have seen the heavens <unk> , the sea rage and <unk> , the storm arise , and , like a monstrous bird , beating the two <unk> with its wings .
Then I felt that my vessel was a vain refuge , that trembled and shook before the tempest .
Soon the fury of the waves and the sight of the sharp rocks announced the approach of death , and death then terrified me , and I used all my skill and intelligence as a man and a sailor to struggle against the wrath of God .
But I did so because I was happy , because I had not <unk> death , because to be cast upon a bed of rocks and <unk> seemed terrible , because I was unwilling that I , a creature made for the service of God , should serve for food to the <unk> and <unk> .
But now it is different ; I have lost all that bound me to life , death smiles and <unk> me to repose ; I die after my own manner , I die exhausted and <unk> , as I fall asleep when I have <unk> three thousand times round my cell , — that is thirty thousand steps , or about ten leagues . ” No sooner had this idea taken possession of him than he became more composed , arranged his <unk> to the best of his power , ate little and slept less , and found existence almost <unk> , because he felt that he could throw it off at pleasure , like a <unk> <unk> .
Two <unk> of <unk> were at his disposal .
He could hang himself with his handkerchief to the window bars , or refuse food and die of <unk> .
But the first was <unk> to him .
Dantès had always entertained the greatest horror of <unk> , who are hung up to the <unk> ; he would not die by what seemed an infamous death .
He resolved to <unk> the second , and began that day to carry out his resolve .
<unk> Nearly four years had passed away ; at the end of the second he had ceased to mark the <unk> of time .
Dantès said , “ I wish to die , ” and had chosen the manner of his death , and fearful of changing his mind , he had taken an oath to die .
“ When my morning and evening <unk> are brought , ” thought he , “ I will cast them out of the window , and they will think that I have eaten them . ” He kept his word ; twice a day he cast out , through the barred aperture , the provisions his jailer brought him — at first <unk> , then with <unk> , and at last with regret .
Nothing but the recollection of his oath gave him strength to proceed .
<unk> made <unk> once <unk> , now <unk> ; he held the plate in his hand for an hour at a time , and gazed <unk> at the <unk> of bad meat , of <unk> fish , of black and <unk> bread .
It was the last <unk> for life <unk> with the resolution of despair ; then his dungeon seemed less sombre , his prospects less desperate .
He was still young — he was only four or <unk> — he had nearly fifty years to live .
What <unk> events might not open his prison door , and restore him to liberty ?
Then he raised to his lips the <unk> that , like a <unk> <unk> , he refused himself ; but he thought of his oath , and he would not break it .
He <unk> until , at last , he had not sufficient strength to rise and cast his supper out of the <unk> .
The next morning he could not see or hear ; the jailer feared he was <unk> ill . Edmond hoped he was dying .
Thus the day passed away .
Edmond felt a sort of <unk> <unk> over him which brought with it a feeling almost of content ; the <unk> pain at his stomach had ceased ; his thirst had <unk> ; when he closed his eyes he saw <unk> of lights dancing before them like the <unk> ’ <unk> that play about the <unk> .
It was the twilight of that mysterious country called Death !
Suddenly , about nine o ’ clock in the evening , Edmond heard a hollow sound in the wall against which he was lying .
So many <unk> animals inhabited the prison , that their noise did not , in general , awake him ; but whether <unk> had <unk> his <unk> , or whether the noise was really <unk> than usual , Edmond raised his head and listened .
It was a continual <unk> , as if made by a huge <unk> , a powerful <unk> , or some iron instrument <unk> the stones .
Although <unk> , the young man ’ s brain instantly responded to the idea that <unk> all prisoners — liberty !
It seemed to him that heaven had at length taken pity on him , and had sent this noise to warn him on the very brink of the abyss .
Perhaps one of those beloved ones he had so often thought of was thinking of him , and <unk> to <unk> the distance that separated them .
No , no , doubtless he was deceived , and it was but one of those dreams that <unk> death !
Edmond still heard the sound .
It lasted nearly three hours ; he then heard a noise of something falling , and all was silent .
Some hours afterwards it began again , nearer and more distinct .
Edmond was <unk> interested .
Suddenly the jailer entered .
For a week since he had resolved to die , and during the four days that he had been carrying out his purpose , Edmond had not spoken to the attendant , had not answered him when he inquired what was the matter with him , and turned his face to the wall when he looked too <unk> at him ; but now the jailer might hear the noise and put an end to it , and so destroy a ray of something like hope that <unk> his last moments .
The jailer brought him his breakfast .
Dantès raised himself up and began to talk about everything ; about the bad quality of the food , about the <unk> of his dungeon , <unk> and <unk> , in order to have an excuse for speaking <unk> , and <unk> the patience of his jailer , who out of kindness of heart had brought <unk> and white bread for his prisoner .
Fortunately , he fancied that Dantès was <unk> ; and placing the food on the <unk> table , he withdrew .
Edmond listened , and the sound became more and more distinct .
“ There can be no doubt about it , ” thought he ; “ it is some prisoner who is <unk> to obtain his freedom .
Oh , if I were only there to help him ! ” Suddenly another idea took possession of his mind , so used to misfortune , that it was scarcely capable of hope — the idea that the noise was made by <unk> the governor had ordered to <unk> the neighboring dungeon .
It was easy to ascertain this ; but how could he risk the question ?
It was easy to call his jailer ’ s attention to the noise , and watch his countenance as he listened ; but might he not by this means destroy hopes far more important than the <unk> satisfaction of his own curiosity ?
<unk> , Edmond ’ s brain was still so feeble that he could not bend his thoughts to anything in particular .
He saw but one means of <unk> <unk> and <unk> to his judgment .
He turned his eyes towards the <unk> which the jailer had brought , rose , <unk> towards it , raised the vessel to his lips , and drank off the contents with a feeling of indescribable pleasure .
He had the resolution to stop with this .
He had often heard that <unk> persons had died through having eagerly <unk> too much food .
Edmond replaced on the table the bread he was about to <unk> , and returned to his <unk> — he did not wish to die .
He soon felt that his ideas became again collected — he could think , and <unk> his thoughts by reasoning .
Then he said to himself : “ I must put this to the <unk> , but without <unk> anybody .
If it is a <unk> , I need but knock against the wall , and he will cease to work , in order to find out who is <unk> , and why he does so ; but as his occupation is <unk> by the governor , he will soon <unk> it .
If , on the contrary , it is a prisoner , the noise I make will alarm him , he will cease , and not begin again until he thinks everyone is asleep . ” Edmond rose again , but this time his legs did not tremble , and his sight was clear ; he went to a corner of his dungeon , detached a stone , and with it knocked against the wall where the sound came .
He struck <unk> .
At the first blow the sound ceased , as if by <unk> .
Edmond listened intently ; an hour passed , two hours passed , and no sound was heard from the wall — all was silent there .
<unk> of hope , Edmond swallowed a few <unk> of bread and water , and , thanks to the <unk> of his <unk> , found himself <unk> recovered .
The day passed away in utter silence — night came without <unk> of the noise .
“ It is a prisoner , ” said Edmond <unk> .
His brain was on fire , and life and energy returned .
The night passed in perfect silence .
Edmond did not close his eyes .
In the morning the jailer brought him fresh provisions — he had already <unk> those of the previous day ; he ate these listening anxiously for the sound , walking round and round his cell , shaking the iron bars of the <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> to his limbs by exercise , and so preparing himself for his future destiny .
At intervals he listened to learn if the noise had not begun again , and grew impatient at the prudence of the prisoner , who did not guess he had been disturbed by a <unk> as anxious for liberty as himself .
Three days passed — <unk> long <unk> hours which he counted off by minutes !
At length one evening , as the jailer was visiting him for the last time that night , Dantès , with his ear for the <unk> time at the wall , fancied he heard an almost imperceptible movement among the stones .
He moved away , walked up and down his cell to collect his thoughts , and then went back and listened .
The matter was no longer doubtful .
Something was at work on the other side of the wall ; the prisoner had discovered the danger , and had <unk> a <unk> for a <unk> .
<unk> by this discovery , Edmond determined to assist the <unk> <unk> .
He began by moving his bed , and looked around for anything with which he could <unk> the wall , penetrate the <unk> <unk> , and <unk> a stone .
He saw nothing , he had no knife or sharp instrument , the window grating was of iron , but he had too often assured himself of its <unk> .
All his furniture consisted of a bed , a chair , a table , a <unk> , and a jug .
The bed had iron <unk> , but they were <unk> to the wood , and it would have required a <unk> to take them off .
The table and chair had nothing , the <unk> had once possessed a handle , but that had been removed .
<unk> Dantès had but one resource , which was to break the jug , and with one of the sharp <unk> attack the wall .
He let the jug fall on the floor , and it broke in pieces .
Dantès concealed two or three of the <unk> <unk> in his bed , leaving the rest on the floor .
The breaking of his jug was too natural an accident to excite suspicion .
Edmond had all the night to work in , but in the darkness he could not do much , and he soon felt that he was working against something very hard ; he pushed back his bed , and waited for day .
All night he heard the subterranean <unk> , who continued to mine his way .
<unk> came , the jailer entered .
Dantès told him that the jug had fallen from his hands while he was drinking , and the jailer went <unk> to fetch another , without giving himself the trouble to remove the <unk> of the broken one .
He returned speedily , <unk> the prisoner to be more careful , and departed .
Dantès heard <unk> the key <unk> in the lock ; he listened until the sound of steps died away , and then , hastily <unk> his bed , saw by the faint light that penetrated into his cell , that he had <unk> <unk> the previous evening in <unk> the stone instead of <unk> the plaster that surrounded it .
The damp had rendered it <unk> , and Dantès was able to break it off — in small <unk> , it is true , but at the end of half an hour he had <unk> off a handful ; a <unk> might have calculated that in two years , supposing that the rock was not encountered , a passage twenty feet long and two feet broad , might be formed .
The prisoner <unk> himself with not having thus employed the hours he had passed in vain hopes , prayer , and <unk> .
During the six years that he had been <unk> , what might he not have accomplished ?
This idea <unk> new energy , and in three days he had succeeded , with the utmost precaution , in <unk> the <unk> , and <unk> the <unk> .
The wall was built of rough stones , among which , to give strength to the <unk> , <unk> of <unk> stone were at intervals <unk> .
It was one of these he had <unk> , and which he must remove from its <unk> .
Dantès strove to do this with his nails , but they were too weak .
The <unk> of the jug broke , and after an hour of useless toil , Dantès paused with anguish on his brow .
Was he to be thus stopped at the beginning , and was he to wait <unk> until his fellow <unk> had completed his task ?
Suddenly an idea occurred to him — he smiled , and the perspiration dried on his forehead .
The jailer always brought Dantès ’ <unk> in an iron <unk> ; this <unk> contained <unk> for both prisoners , for Dantès had noticed that it was either quite full , or half empty , according as the turnkey gave it to him or to his companion first .
The handle of this <unk> was of iron ; Dantès would have given ten years of his life in exchange for it .
<unk> The jailer was accustomed to <unk> the contents of the <unk> into Dantès ’ plate , and Dantès , after eating his <unk> with a wooden <unk> , <unk> the plate , which thus served for every day .
Now when evening came Dantès put his plate on the ground near the door ; the jailer , as he entered , stepped on it and broke it .
This time he could not blame Dantès .
He was wrong to leave it there , but the jailer was wrong not to have looked before him .
The jailer , therefore , only <unk> .
Then he looked about for something to <unk> the <unk> into ; Dantès ’ entire dinner service consisted of one plate — there was no <unk> .
“ Leave the <unk> , ” said Dantès ; “ you can take it away when you bring me my breakfast . ” This advice was to the jailer ’ s taste , as it spared him the necessity of making another trip .
He left the <unk> .
Dantès was beside himself with joy .
He rapidly <unk> his food , and after waiting an hour , lest the jailer should change his mind and return , he removed his bed , took the handle of the <unk> , <unk> the point between the <unk> stone and rough stones of the wall , and employed it as a <unk> .
A slight <unk> showed Dantès that all went well .
At the end of an hour the stone was <unk> from the wall , leaving a <unk> a foot and a half in <unk> .
Dantès carefully collected the plaster , carried it into the corner of his cell , and covered it with earth .
Then , wishing to make the best use of his time while he had the means of labor , he continued to work without <unk> .
At the dawn of day he replaced the stone , pushed his bed against the wall , and lay down .
The breakfast consisted of a piece of bread ; the jailer entered and placed the bread on the table .
“ Well , don ’ t you intend to bring me another plate ? ” said Dantès .
“ No , ” replied the turnkey ; “ you destroy everything .
First you break your jug , then you make me break your plate ; if all the prisoners followed your example , the government would be ruined .
I shall leave you the <unk> , and <unk> your <unk> into that .
So for the future I hope you will not be so <unk> . ” Dantès raised his eyes to heaven and clasped his hands beneath the <unk> .
He felt more gratitude for the possession of this piece of iron than he had ever felt for anything .
He had noticed , however , that the prisoner on the other side had ceased to labor ; no matter , this was a greater reason for proceeding — if his neighbor would not come to him , he would go to his neighbor .
All day he <unk> on <unk> , and by the evening he had succeeded in <unk> ten <unk> of plaster and <unk> of stone .
When the hour for his jailer ’ s visit arrived , Dantès <unk> the handle of the <unk> as well as he could , and placed it in its accustomed place .
The turnkey poured his <unk> of <unk> into it , together with the fish — for <unk> a week the prisoners were deprived of meat .
This would have been a method of <unk> time , had not Dantès long ceased to do so .
Having poured out the <unk> , the turnkey retired .
Dantès wished to ascertain whether his neighbor had really ceased to work .
He listened — all was silent , as it had been for the last three days .
Dantès sighed ; it was evident that his neighbor <unk> him .
However , he <unk> on all the night without being <unk> ; but after two or three hours he encountered an obstacle .
The iron made no impression , but met with a smooth surface ; Dantès touched it , and found that it was a <unk> .
This <unk> crossed , or rather <unk> up , the hole Dantès had made ; it was necessary , therefore , to <unk> above or under it .
The unhappy young man had not thought of this .
“ Oh , my God , my God ! ” murmured he , “ I have so earnestly <unk> to you , that I hoped my prayers had been heard .
After having deprived me of my liberty , after having deprived me of death , after having recalled me to existence , my God , have pity on me , and do not let me die in despair ! ” <unk> “ Who <unk> of God and despair at the same time ? ” said a voice that seemed to come from beneath the earth , and , <unk> by the distance , sounded hollow and <unk> in the young man ’ s ears .
Edmond ’ s hair stood on end , and he rose to his knees .
“ Ah , ” said he , “ I hear a human voice . ” Edmond had not heard anyone speak save his jailer for four or five years ; and a jailer is no man to a prisoner — he is a living door , a barrier of flesh and blood <unk> strength to <unk> of <unk> and iron .
“ In the name of Heaven , ” cried Dantès , “ speak again , though the sound of your voice <unk> me .
Who are you ? ” “ Who are you ? ” said the voice .
“ An unhappy prisoner , ” replied Dantès , who made no hesitation in answering .
“ Of what country ? ” “ A Frenchman . ” “ Your name ? ” “ Edmond Dantès . ” “ Your profession ? ” “ A sailor . ” “ How long have you been here ? ” “ Since the <unk> of February , 1815 . ” “ Your crime ? ” “ I am innocent . ” “ But of what are you accused ? ” “ Of having <unk> to aid the emperor ’ s return . ” “ What !
For the emperor ’ s return ? — the emperor is no longer on the throne , then ? ” “ He <unk> at <unk> in <unk> , and was sent to the Island of Elba .
But how long have you been here that you are ignorant of all this ? ” “ Since <unk> . ” Dantès shuddered ; this man had been four years longer than himself in prison .
“ Do not <unk> any more , ” said the voice ; “ only tell me how high up is your <unk> ? ” “ On a level with the floor . ” “ How is it concealed ? ” “ Behind my bed . ” “ Has your bed been moved since you have been a prisoner ? ” “ No . ” “ What does your chamber open on ? ” “ A corridor . ” “ And the corridor ? ” “ On a court . ” “ Alas ! ” murmured the voice .
“ Oh , what is the matter ? ” cried Dantès .
“ I have made a mistake owing to an error in my plans .
I took the wrong angle , and have come out fifteen feet from where I intended .
I took the wall you are <unk> for the outer wall of the <unk> . ” “ But then you would be close to the sea ? ” “ That is what I hoped . ” “ And supposing you had succeeded ? ” “ I should have thrown myself into the sea , gained one of the <unk> near here — the <unk> de <unk> or the <unk> de <unk> — and then I should have been safe . ” “ Could you have <unk> so far ? ” “ Heaven would have given me strength ; but now all is lost . ” “ All ? ” “ Yes ; stop up your <unk> carefully , do not work any more , and wait until you hear from me . ” “ Tell me , at least , who you are ? ” “ I am — I am No .
<unk> . ” “ You <unk> me , then , ” said Dantès .
Edmond fancied he heard a bitter laugh <unk> from the depths .
“ Oh , I am a Christian , ” cried Dantès , <unk> instinctively that this man meant to abandon him .
“ I swear to you by him who died for us that <unk> shall induce me to breathe one syllable to my <unk> ; but I <unk> you do not abandon me .
If you do , I swear to you , for I have got to the end of my strength , that I will <unk> my brains out against the wall , and you will have my death to reproach yourself with . ” “ How old are you ?
Your voice is that of a young man . ” “ I do not know my age , for I have not counted the years I have been here .
All I do know is , that I was just nineteen when I was arrested , the <unk> of February , 1815 . ” “ Not quite <unk> ! ” murmured the voice ; “ at that age he cannot be a <unk> . ” “ Oh , no , no , ” cried Dantès .
“ I swear to you again , rather than betray you , I would allow myself to be <unk> in pieces ! ” “ You have done well to speak to me , and ask for my assistance , for I was about to form another plan , and leave you ; but your age <unk> me .
I will not forget you .
Wait . ” “ How long ? ” “ I must <unk> our chances ; I will give you the signal . ” “ But you will not leave me ; you will come to me , or you will let me come to you .
We will escape , and if we cannot escape we will talk ; you of those whom you love , and I of those whom I love .
You must love somebody ? ” “ No , I am alone in the world . ” “ Then you will love me .
If you are young , I will be your comrade ; if you are old , I will be your son .
I have a father who is <unk> if he yet lives ; I only love him and a young girl called Mercédès .
My father has not yet forgotten me , I am sure , but God alone knows if she loves me still ; I shall love you as I loved my father . ” “ It is well , ” returned the voice ; “ tomorrow . ” These few words were uttered with an accent that left no doubt of his sincerity ; Dantès rose , <unk> the <unk> with the same precaution as before , and pushed his bed back against the wall .
He then gave himself up to his happiness .
He would no longer be alone .
He was , perhaps , about to <unk> his liberty ; at the worst , he would have a companion , and <unk> that is shared is but half <unk> .
<unk> made in common are almost prayers , and prayers where two or three are gathered together <unk> the mercy of heaven .
All day Dantès walked up and down his cell .
He sat down occasionally on his bed , pressing his hand on his heart .
At the slightest noise he bounded towards the door .
Once or twice the thought crossed his mind that he might be separated from this unknown , whom he loved already ; and then his mind was made up — when the jailer moved his bed and <unk> to examine the opening , he would kill him with his water jug .
He would be condemned to die , but he was about to die of grief and despair when this <unk> noise recalled him to life .
The jailer came in the evening .
Dantès was on his bed .
It seemed to him that thus he better guarded the <unk> opening .
<unk> there was a strange expression in his eyes , for the jailer said , “ Come , are you going mad again ? ” Dantès did not answer ; he feared that the emotion of his voice would betray him .
The jailer went away shaking his head .
Night came ; Dantès hoped that his neighbor would profit by the silence to address him , but he was mistaken .
The next morning , however , just as he removed his bed from the wall , he heard three <unk> ; he threw himself on his knees .
“ Is it you ? ” said he ; “ I am here . ” “ Is your jailer gone ? ” “ Yes , ” said Dantès ; “ he will not return until the evening ; so that we have twelve hours before us . ” “ I can work , then ? ” said the voice .
“ Oh , yes , yes ; this instant , I entreat you . ” In a moment that part of the floor on which Dantès was resting his two hands , as he knelt with his head in the opening , suddenly gave way ; he drew back <unk> , while a mass of stones and earth disappeared in a hole that opened beneath the aperture he himself had formed .
Then from the bottom of this passage , the depth of which it was impossible to measure , he saw appear , first the head , then the shoulders , and <unk> the body of a man , who sprang lightly into his cell .
<unk> Chapter <unk> .
A <unk> Italian <unk> in his arms the friend so long and <unk> desired , Dantès almost carried him towards the window , in order to obtain a better view of his features by the aid of the <unk> light that struggled through the grating .
He was a man of small stature , with hair <unk> rather by suffering and sorrow than by age .
He had a <unk> , penetrating eye , almost buried beneath the thick gray <unk> , and a long ( and still black ) beard reaching down to his breast .
His thin face , deeply <unk> by care , and the bold <unk> of his strongly marked features , <unk> a man more accustomed to exercise his mental <unk> than his physical strength .
<unk> drops of perspiration were now standing on his brow , while the garments that hung about him were so <unk> that one could only guess at the pattern upon which they had <unk> been <unk> .
The stranger might have <unk> sixty or <unk> years ; but a certain <unk> and appearance of <unk> in his movements made it probable that he was aged more from <unk> than the course of time .
He received the enthusiastic <unk> of his young acquaintance with evident pleasure , as though his chilled affections were <unk> and <unk> by his contact with one so warm and ardent .
He thanked him with grateful <unk> for his kindly welcome , although he must at that moment have been suffering bitterly to find another dungeon where he had <unk> <unk> on <unk> a means of <unk> his liberty .
“ Let us first see , ” said he , “ whether it is possible to remove the traces of my entrance here — our future tranquillity depends upon our <unk> being entirely ignorant of it . ” <unk> to the opening , he <unk> and raised the stone easily in spite of its weight ; then , <unk> it into its place , he said : “ You removed this stone very <unk> ; but I suppose you had no tools to aid you . ” “ Why , ” exclaimed Dantès , with astonishment , “ do you possess any ? ” “ I made myself some ; and with the exception of a file , I have all that are necessary , — a <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . ” <unk> “ Oh , how I should like to see these <unk> of your <unk> and patience . ” “ Well , in the first place , here is my <unk> . ” So saying , he displayed a sharp strong <unk> , with a handle made of <unk> .
“ And with what did you <unk> to make that ? ” inquired Dantès .
“ With one of the <unk> of my <unk> ; and this very <unk> has sufficed me to hollow out the road by which I came hither , a distance of about fifty feet . ” “ <unk> feet ! ” responded Dantès , almost terrified .
“ Do not speak so loud , young man — don ’ t speak so loud .
It frequently <unk> in a state prison like this , that persons are stationed outside the doors of the <unk> <unk> to <unk> the conversation of the prisoners . ” “ But they believe I am shut up alone here . ” “ That makes no difference . ” “ And you say that you dug your way a distance of fifty feet to get here ? ” “ I do ; that is about the distance that <unk> your chamber from mine ; only , unfortunately , I did not <unk> <unk> ; for want of the necessary <unk> instruments to <unk> my scale of proportion , instead of taking an <unk> of forty feet , I made it fifty .
I expected , as I told you , to reach the outer wall , <unk> through it , and throw myself into the sea ; I have , however , kept along the corridor on which your chamber opens , instead of going beneath it .
My labor is all in vain , for I find that the corridor looks into a courtyard filled with soldiers . ” “ That ’ s true , ” said Dantès ; “ but the corridor you speak of only bounds _ one _ side of my cell ; there are three others — do you know anything of their situation ? ” “ This one is built against the solid rock , and it would take ten experienced <unk> , <unk> furnished with the requisite tools , as many years to <unk> it .
This <unk> the lower part of the governor ’ s apartments , and were we to work our way through , we should only get into some <unk> <unk> , where we must necessarily be <unk> .
The fourth and last side of your cell faces on — faces on — stop a minute , now where does it face ? ” The wall of which he spoke was the one in which was fixed the <unk> by which light was admitted to the chamber .
This <unk> , which gradually <unk> in size as it approached the outside , to an opening through which a child could not have passed , was , for better security , furnished with three iron bars , so as to quiet all <unk> even in the mind of the most suspicious jailer as to the possibility of a prisoner ’ s escape .
As the stranger asked the question , he dragged the table beneath the window .
“ <unk> up , ” said he to Dantès .
The young man obeyed , mounted on the table , and , <unk> the wishes of his companion , placed his back <unk> against the wall and held out both hands .
The stranger , whom as yet Dantès knew only by the number of his cell , sprang up with an <unk> by no means to be expected in a person of his years , and , light and steady on his feet as a cat or a <unk> , <unk> from the table to the <unk> hands of Dantès , and from them to his shoulders ; then , bending double , for the ceiling of the dungeon prevented him from holding himself erect , he managed to slip his head between the upper bars of the window , so as to be able to command a perfect view from top to bottom .
An instant afterwards he hastily drew back his head , saying , “ I thought so ! ” and <unk> from the shoulders of Dantès as <unk> as he had ascended , he <unk> leaped from the table to the ground .
“ What was it that you thought ? ” asked the young man anxiously , in his turn descending from the table .
The elder prisoner <unk> the matter .
“ Yes , ” said he at length , “ it is so .
This side of your chamber looks out upon a kind of open gallery , where <unk> are continually passing , and <unk> keep watch day and night . ” “ Are you quite sure of that ? ” “ Certain .
I saw the soldier ’ s shape and the top of his <unk> ; that made me draw in my head so quickly , for I was fearful he might also see me . ” “ Well ? ” inquired Dantès .
“ You perceive then the utter <unk> of <unk> through your dungeon ? ” “ Then — — ” pursued the young man eagerly .
“ Then , ” answered the elder prisoner , “ the will of God be done ! ” And as the old man slowly pronounced those words , an air of profound resignation spread itself over his <unk> countenance .
Dantès gazed on the man who could thus <unk> <unk> hopes so long and <unk> <unk> with an astonishment mingled with admiration .
“ Tell me , I entreat of you , who and what you are ? ” said he at length .
“ Never have I met with so remarkable a person as yourself . ” “ <unk> , ” answered the stranger ; “ if , indeed , you feel any curiosity respecting one , now , alas , <unk> to aid you in any way . ” “ Say not so ; you can console and support me by the strength of your own powerful mind .
Pray let me know who you really are ? ” The stranger smiled a melancholy smile .
“ Then listen , ” said he .
“ I am the Abbé Faria , and have been <unk> as you know in this Château d ’ If since the year <unk> ; previously to which I had been confined for three years in the <unk> of <unk> .
In the year <unk> I was <unk> to <unk> in France .
It was at this period I learned that the destiny which seemed <unk> to every wish formed by Napoleon , had bestowed on him a son , named king of Rome even in his <unk> .
I was very far then from expecting the change you have just informed me of ; <unk> , that four years afterwards , this <unk> of power would be <unk> .
Then who <unk> in France at this moment — Napoleon <unk> .
? ” “ No , Louis XVIII . ” “ The brother of Louis <unk> . !
How <unk> are the ways of Providence — for what great and mysterious purpose has it pleased Heaven to <unk> the man once so elevated , and raise up him who was so <unk> ? ” Dantès ’ whole attention was <unk> on a man who could thus forget his own misfortunes while <unk> himself with the <unk> of others .
“ Yes , yes , ” continued he , “ ’ <unk> be the same as it was in England .
After Charles I. , <unk> ; after <unk> , Charles <unk> . , and then James <unk> . , and then some <unk> or relation , some Prince of <unk> , a <unk> who becomes a king .
Then new <unk> to the people , then a <unk> , then liberty .
Ah , my friend ! ” said the abbé , turning towards Dantès , and <unk> him with the <unk> gaze of a <unk> , “ you are young , you will see all this come to pass . ” “ <unk> , if ever I get out of prison ! ” “ True , ” replied Faria , “ we are prisoners ; but I forget this sometimes , and there are even moments when my mental vision <unk> me beyond these walls , and I fancy myself at liberty . ” “ But <unk> are you here ? ” “ Because in <unk> I dreamed of the very plan Napoleon tried to realize in <unk> ; because , like <unk> , I desired to alter the political face of Italy , and instead of allowing it to be <unk> up into a quantity of petty <unk> , each held by some weak or <unk> <unk> , I sought to form one large , <unk> , and powerful <unk> ; and , <unk> , because I fancied I had found my Cæsar <unk> in a crowned <unk> , who <unk> to enter into my views only to betray me .
It was the plan of Alexander <unk> .
and <unk> <unk> . , but it will never succeed now , for they attempted it <unk> , and Napoleon was unable to complete his work .
Italy seems <unk> to misfortune . ” And the old man bowed his head .
Dantès could not understand a man <unk> his life for such matters .
Napoleon certainly he knew something of , <unk> as he had seen and spoken with him ; but of <unk> <unk> .
and Alexander <unk> .
he knew nothing .
“ Are you not , ” he asked , “ the priest who here in the Château d ’ If is generally thought to be — ill ? ” “ <unk> , you mean , don ’ t you ? ” “ I did not like to say so , ” answered Dantès , smiling .
“ Well , then , ” resumed Faria with a bitter smile , “ let me answer your question in full , by <unk> that I am the poor mad prisoner of the Château d ’ If , for many years permitted to amuse the different visitors with what is said to be my <unk> ; and , in all probability , I should be <unk> to the honor of making <unk> for the children , if such innocent beings could be found in an abode devoted like this to suffering and despair . ” Dantès remained for a short time mute and motionless ; at length he said : “ Then you abandon all hope of escape ? ” “ I perceive its utter <unk> ; and I consider it <unk> to attempt that which the <unk> evidently does not approve . ” “ Nay , be not <unk> .
Would it not be expecting too much to hope to succeed at your first attempt ?
Why not try to find an opening in another direction from that which has so unfortunately failed ? ” “ Alas , it shows how little <unk> you can have of all it has cost me to effect a purpose so <unk> <unk> , that you talk of beginning over again .
In the first place , I was four years making the tools I possess , and have been two years <unk> and <unk> out earth , hard as granite itself ; then what toil and fatigue has it not been to remove huge stones I should once have <unk> impossible to <unk> .
<unk> days have I passed in these <unk> efforts , considering my labor well <unk> if , by <unk> I had contrived to carry away a square <unk> of this <unk> <unk> , changed by <unk> into a substance <unk> as the stones themselves ; then to conceal the mass of earth and rubbish I dug up , I was compelled to break through a staircase , and throw the <unk> of my labor into the hollow part of it ; but the well is now so completely <unk> up , that I scarcely think it would be possible to add another handful of dust without leading to discovery .
<unk> also that I fully believed I had accomplished the end and aim of my <unk> , for which I had so exactly <unk> my strength as to make it just hold out to the <unk> of my <unk> ; and now , at the moment when I <unk> upon success , my hopes are forever dashed from me .
No , I repeat again , that nothing shall induce me to <unk> attempts evidently at <unk> with the <unk> ’ s pleasure . ” Dantès held down his head , that the other might not see how joy at the thought of having a companion <unk> the sympathy he felt for the failure of the abbé ’ s plans .
The abbé sank upon Edmond ’ s bed , while Edmond himself remained standing .
<unk> had never once occurred to him .
There are , indeed , some things which appear so impossible that the mind does not dwell on them for an instant .
To <unk> the ground for fifty feet — to <unk> three years to a labor which , if successful , would conduct you to a <unk> <unk> the sea — to <unk> into the waves from the height of fifty , sixty , perhaps a hundred feet , at the risk of being dashed to pieces against the rocks , should you have been fortunate enough to have escaped the fire of the <unk> ; and even , supposing all these <unk> past , then to have to <unk> for your life a distance of at least three miles ere you could reach the shore — were difficulties so startling and formidable that Dantès had never even dreamed of such a scheme , <unk> himself rather to death .
But the sight of an old man <unk> to life with so desperate a courage , gave a fresh turn to his ideas , and inspired him with new courage .
Another , older and less strong than he , had attempted what he had not had sufficient resolution to <unk> , and had failed only because of an error in <unk> .
This same person , with almost incredible patience and <unk> , had contrived to provide himself with tools requisite for so <unk> an attempt .
Another had done all this ; why , then , was it impossible to Dantès ?
Faria had dug his way through fifty feet , Dantès would <unk> a hundred ; Faria , at the age of fifty , had devoted three years to the task ; he , who was but half as old , would sacrifice six ; Faria , a priest and <unk> , had not <unk> from the idea of <unk> his life by trying to <unk> a distance of three miles to one of the <unk> — <unk> , <unk> , or <unk> ; should a <unk> sailor , an experienced <unk> , like himself , <unk> from a similar task ; should he , who had so often for mere amusement ’ s sake plunged to the bottom of the sea to fetch up the bright <unk> branch , hesitate to entertain the same project ?
He could do it in an hour , and how many times had he , for pure <unk> , continued in the water for more than twice as long !
At once Dantès resolved to follow the brave example of his energetic companion , and to remember that what has once been done may be done again .
After <unk> some time in profound meditation , the young man suddenly exclaimed , “ I have found what you were in search of ! ” Faria started : “ Have you , indeed ? ” cried he , raising his head with quick anxiety ; “ pray , let me know what it is you have discovered ? ” “ The corridor through which you have <unk> your way from the cell you occupy here , <unk> in the same direction as the outer gallery , does it not ? ” <unk> “ It does . ” “ And is not above fifteen feet from it ? ” “ About that . ” “ Well , then , I will tell you what we must do .
We must <unk> through the corridor by forming a side opening about the middle , as it were the top part of a cross .
This time you will lay your plans more <unk> ; we shall get out into the gallery you have described ; kill the sentinel who guards it , and make our escape .
All we require to <unk> success is courage , and that you possess , and strength , which I am not <unk> in ; as for patience , you have <unk> proved yours — you shall now see me prove mine . ” “ One instant , my dear friend , ” replied the abbé ; “ it is clear you do not understand the nature of the courage with which I am <unk> , and what use I intend making of my strength .
As for patience , I consider that I have <unk> exercised that in beginning every morning the task of the night before , and every night <unk> the task of the day .
But then , young man ( and I pray of you to give me your full attention ) , then I thought I could not be doing anything <unk> to the <unk> in trying to set an innocent being at liberty — one who had committed no offence , and <unk> not <unk> . ” “ And have your <unk> changed ? ” asked Dantès with much surprise ; “ do you think yourself more guilty in making the attempt since you have encountered me ? ” “ No ; neither do I wish to <unk> guilt .
<unk> I have fancied myself merely <unk> war against circumstances , not men .
I have thought it no sin to bore through a wall , or destroy a staircase ; but I cannot so easily persuade myself to <unk> a heart or take away a life . ” A slight movement of surprise escaped Dantès .
“ Is it possible , ” said he , “ that where your liberty is at stake you can allow any such scruple to <unk> you from obtaining it ? ” “ Tell me , ” replied Faria , “ what has <unk> you from <unk> down your jailer with a piece of wood torn from your <unk> , <unk> yourself in his clothes , and endeavoring to escape ? ” “ <unk> the fact that the idea never occurred to me , ” answered Dantès .
“ Because , ” said the old man , “ the natural <unk> to the commission of such a crime prevented you from thinking of it ; and so it ever is because in simple and <unk> things our natural <unk> keep us from <unk> from the strict line of duty .
The tiger , whose nature <unk> him to delight in <unk> blood , needs but the sense of smell to show him when his prey is within his reach , and by following this instinct he is enabled to measure the <unk> necessary to permit him to spring on his victim ; but man , on the contrary , <unk> the idea of blood — it is not alone that the laws of social life inspire him with a <unk> dread of taking life ; his natural construction and <unk> <unk> — — ” Dantès was confused and silent at this explanation of the thoughts which had unconsciously been working in his mind , or rather soul ; for there are two distinct sorts of ideas , those that proceed from the head and those that <unk> from the heart .
<unk> “ Since my <unk> , ” said Faria , “ I have thought over all the most celebrated cases of escape on record .
They have rarely been successful .
Those that have been crowned with full success have been long meditated upon , and carefully arranged ; such , for instance , as the escape of the Duc de <unk> from the Château de <unk> , that of the Abbé <unk> from For l ’ <unk> ; of <unk> from the Bastille .
Then there are those for which chance sometimes <unk> opportunity , and those are the best of all .
Let us , therefore , wait <unk> for some favorable moment , and when it presents itself , profit by it . ” “ Ah , ” said Dantès , “ you might well endure the <unk> delay ; you were constantly employed in the task you set yourself , and when weary with toil , you had your hopes to <unk> and <unk> you . ” “ I assure you , ” replied the old man , “ I did not turn to that source for <unk> or support . ” “ What did you do then ? ” “ I wrote or studied . ” “ Were you then permitted the use of <unk> , ink , and paper ? ” “ Oh , no , ” answered the abbé ; “ I had none but what I made for myself . ” “ You made paper , <unk> and ink ? ” “ Yes . ” Dantès gazed with admiration , but he had some difficulty in believing .
Faria saw this .
“ When you pay me a visit in my cell , my young friend , ” said he , “ I will show you an entire work , the <unk> of the thoughts and reflections of my whole life ; many of them meditated over in the shades of the Colosseum at Rome , at the foot of St. <unk> ’ s column at <unk> , and on the <unk> of the <unk> at <unk> , little <unk> at the time that they would be arranged in order within the walls of the Château d ’ If .
The work I speak of is called _ A <unk> on the <unk> of a General <unk> in Italy _ , and will make one large <unk> volume . ” “ And on what have you written all this ? ” “ On two of my <unk> .
I invented a preparation that makes linen as smooth and as easy to write on as <unk> . ” “ You are , then , a <unk> ? ” “ <unk> ; I know <unk> , and was the intimate friend of <unk> . ” “ But for such a work you must have needed books — had you any ? ” “ I had nearly five thousand <unk> in my library at Rome ; but after reading them over many times , I found out that with one hundred and fifty <unk> books a man possesses , if not a complete <unk> of all human knowledge , at least all that a man need really know .
I devoted three years of my life to reading and <unk> these one hundred and fifty <unk> , till I knew them nearly by heart ; so that since I have been in prison , a very slight effort of memory has enabled me to recall their contents as readily as though the pages were open before me .
I could <unk> you the whole of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and Bossuet .
I name only the most important . ” “ You are , doubtless , acquainted with a variety of <unk> , so as to have been able to read all these ? ” “ Yes , I speak five of the modern <unk> — that is to say , German , French , Italian , English , and Spanish ; by the aid of ancient Greek I learned modern Greek — I don ’ t speak it so well as I could wish , but I am still trying to <unk> myself . ” “ <unk> yourself ! ” repeated Dantès ; “ why , how can you manage to do so ? ” “ Why , I made a <unk> of the words I knew ; turned , returned , and arranged them , so as to <unk> me to express my thoughts through their medium .
I know nearly one thousand words , which is all that is absolutely necessary , although I believe there are nearly one hundred thousand in the <unk> .
I cannot hope to be very <unk> , but I certainly should have no difficulty in <unk> my wants and wishes ; and that would be quite as much as I should ever require . ” <unk> grew the wonder of Dantès , who almost fancied he had to do with one <unk> with <unk> powers ; still hoping to find some <unk> which might bring him down to a level with human beings , he added , “ Then if you were not furnished with <unk> , how did you manage to write the work you speak of ? ” “ I made myself some excellent ones , which would be <unk> preferred to all others if once known .
You are aware what huge <unk> are served to us on _ <unk> _ days .
Well , I selected the <unk> of the heads of these <unk> , and you can scarcely imagine the delight with which I welcomed the arrival of each <unk> , <unk> , and Saturday , as <unk> me the means of increasing my stock of <unk> ; for I will freely confess that my <unk> <unk> have been my greatest <unk> and relief .
While <unk> the past , I forget the present ; and <unk> at will the path of history I cease to remember that I am myself a prisoner . ” “ But the ink , ” said Dantès ; “ of what did you make your ink ? ” “ There was formerly a fireplace in my dungeon , ” replied Faria , “ but it was closed up long ere I became an <unk> of this prison .
Still , it must have been many years in use , for it was <unk> covered with a <unk> of <unk> ; this <unk> I <unk> in a portion of the wine brought to me every Sunday , and I assure you a better ink cannot be desired .
For very important notes , for which closer attention is required , I <unk> one of my fingers , and wrote with my own blood . ” “ And when , ” asked Dantès , “ may I see all this ? ” “ <unk> you please , ” replied the abbé .
“ Oh , then let it be directly ! ” exclaimed the young man .
“ <unk> me , then , ” said the abbé , as he re-entered the subterranean passage , in which he soon disappeared , followed by Dantès .
Chapter 17 .
The Abbé ’ s Chamber After having passed with tolerable ease through the subterranean passage , which , however , did not admit of their holding themselves erect , the two friends reached the further end of the corridor , into which the abbé ’ s cell opened ; from that point the passage became much <unk> , and barely permitted one to <unk> through on hands and knees .
The floor of the abbé ’ s cell was <unk> , and it had been by raising one of the stones in the most obscure corner that Faria had been able to <unk> the <unk> task of which Dantès had witnessed the <unk> .
As he entered the chamber of his friend , Dantès cast around one eager and searching glance in <unk> of the expected <unk> , but nothing more than common met his view .
“ It is well , ” said the abbé ; “ we have some hours before us — it is now just a quarter past twelve o ’ clock . ” <unk> Dantès turned round to observe by what watch or clock the abbé had been able so <unk> to <unk> the hour .
“ Look at this ray of light which enters by my window , ” said the abbé , “ and then observe the lines traced on the wall .
Well , by means of these lines , which are in accordance with the double motion of the earth , and the <unk> it <unk> round the sun , I am enabled to ascertain the precise hour with more <unk> than if I possessed a watch ; for that might be broken or <unk> in its movements , while the sun and earth never <unk> in their appointed paths . ” This last explanation was wholly lost upon Dantès , who had always imagined , from seeing the sun rise from behind the mountains and set in the <unk> , that it moved , and not the earth .
A double movement of the <unk> he inhabited , and of which he could feel nothing , appeared to him perfectly impossible .
Each word that fell from his companion ’ s lips seemed <unk> with the mysteries of science , as worthy of <unk> out as the gold and diamonds in the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , which he could just recollect having visited during a voyage made in his <unk> youth .
“ Come , ” said he to the abbé , “ I am anxious to see your treasures . ” The abbé smiled , and , proceeding to the <unk> fireplace , raised , by the help of his <unk> , a long stone , which had doubtless been the hearth , beneath which was a <unk> of considerable depth , <unk> as a safe <unk> of the <unk> mentioned to Dantès .
<unk> “ What do you wish to see first ? ” asked the abbé .
“ Oh , your great work on the monarchy of Italy ! ” Faria then drew forth from his <unk> three or four <unk> of linen , laid one over the other , like folds of <unk> .
These <unk> consisted of <unk> of cloth about four inches wide and eighteen long ; they were all carefully <unk> and closely covered with writing , so <unk> that Dantès could easily read it , as well as make out the sense — it being in Italian , a language he , as a <unk> , perfectly understood .
“ There , ” said he , “ there is the work complete .
I wrote the word _ <unk> _ at the end of the <unk> <unk> about a week ago .
I have torn up two of my <unk> , and as many <unk> as I was master of , to complete the precious pages .
Should I ever get out of prison and find in all Italy a <unk> <unk> enough to <unk> what I have composed , my <unk> reputation is forever secured . ” “ I see , ” answered Dantès .
“ Now let me behold the curious <unk> with which you have written your work . ” “ Look ! ” said Faria , showing to the young man a <unk> stick about six inches long , and much resembling the size of the handle of a fine <unk> , to the end of which was tied , by a piece of thread , one of those <unk> of which the abbé had before spoken to Dantès ; it was pointed , and divided at the <unk> like an ordinary pen .
Dantès examined it with intense admiration , then looked around to see the instrument with which it had been <unk> so <unk> into form .
“ Ah , yes , ” said Faria ; “ the <unk> .
That ’ s my <unk> .
I made it , as well as this larger knife , out of an old iron <unk> . ” The <unk> was sharp and <unk> as a <unk> ; as for the other knife , it would serve a double purpose , and with it one could cut and thrust .
Dantès examined the various <unk> shown to him with the same attention that he had bestowed on the <unk> and strange tools exhibited in the <unk> at Marseilles as the works of the <unk> in the South <unk> from whence they had been brought by the different <unk> <unk> .
“ As for the ink , ” said Faria , “ I told you how I managed to obtain that — and I only just make it from time to time , as I require it . ” “ One thing still <unk> me , ” observed Dantès , “ and that is how you managed to do all this by daylight ? ” “ I worked at night also , ” replied Faria .
“ Night ! — why , for Heaven ’ s sake , are your eyes like <unk> ’ , that you can see to work in the dark ? ” “ Indeed they are not ; but God has supplied man with the intelligence that <unk> him to overcome the <unk> of natural conditions .
I furnished myself with a light . ” “ You did ?
Pray tell me how . ” “ I separated the fat from the meat served to me , <unk> it , and so made <unk> — here is my lamp . ” So saying , the abbé exhibited a sort of torch very similar to those used in public <unk> .
“ But how do you procure a light ? ” “ Oh , here are two <unk> and a piece of burnt linen . ” “ And <unk> ? ” “ I pretended that I had a disorder of the skin , and asked for a little <unk> , which was readily supplied . ” Dantès laid the different things he had been looking at on the table , and stood with his head drooping on his breast , as though overwhelmed by the <unk> and strength of Faria ’ s mind .
<unk> “ You have not seen all yet , ” continued Faria , “ for I did not think it wise to trust all my treasures in the same <unk> .
Let us shut this one up . ” They put the stone back in its place ; the abbé <unk> a little dust over it to conceal the traces of its having been removed , <unk> his foot well on it to make it assume the same appearance as the other , and then , going towards his bed , he removed it from the spot it stood in .
Behind the head of the bed , and concealed by a stone <unk> in so closely as to <unk> all suspicion , was a hollow space , and in this space a ladder of <unk> between twenty-five and thirty feet in length .
Dantès closely and eagerly examined it ; he found it firm , solid , and <unk> enough to bear any weight .
“ Who supplied you with the <unk> for making this wonderful work ? ” “ I tore up several of my <unk> , and <unk> out the <unk> in the sheets of my bed , during my three years ’ <unk> at <unk> ; and when I was removed to the Château d ’ If , I managed to bring the <unk> with me , so that I have been able to finish my work here . ” “ And was it not discovered that your sheets were <unk> ? ” “ Oh , no , for when I had taken out the thread I required , I <unk> the <unk> over again . ” “ With what ? ” “ With this <unk> , ” said the abbé , as , opening his <unk> <unk> , he showed Dantès a long , sharp <unk> , with a small <unk> eye for the thread , a small portion of which still remained in it .
“ I once thought , ” continued Faria , “ of <unk> these iron bars , and letting myself down from the window , which , as you see , is somewhat <unk> than yours , although I should have <unk> it still more <unk> to my flight ; however , I discovered that I should merely have dropped into a sort of inner court , and I therefore <unk> the project altogether as too full of risk and danger .
Nevertheless , I carefully preserved my ladder against one of those <unk> <unk> of which I spoke just now , and which sudden chance frequently brings about . ” While <unk> to be deeply engaged in examining the ladder , the mind of Dantès was , in fact , <unk> occupied by the idea that a person so intelligent , ingenious , and <unk> as the abbé might probably be able to <unk> the dark mystery of his own misfortunes , where he himself could see nothing .
“ What are you thinking of ? ” asked the abbé <unk> , <unk> the deep <unk> in which his visitor was plunged to the excess of his <unk> and wonder .
“ I was <unk> , in the first place , ” replied Dantès , “ upon the enormous degree of intelligence and <unk> you must have employed to reach the high perfection to which you have attained .
What would you not have accomplished if you had been free ? ” “ <unk> nothing at all ; the <unk> of my brain would probably , in a state of freedom , have <unk> in a thousand <unk> ; misfortune is needed to bring to light the treasures of the human <unk> .
<unk> is needed to <unk> <unk> .
<unk> has brought my mental <unk> to a <unk> ; and you are well aware that from the <unk> of clouds <unk> is produced — from <unk> , lightning , from lightning , <unk> . ” “ No , ” replied Dantès .
“ I know nothing .
Some of your words are to me quite empty of meaning .
You must be blessed indeed to possess the knowledge you have . ” The abbé smiled .
“ Well , ” said he , “ but you had another subject for your thoughts ; did you not say so just now ? ” “ I did ! ” “ You have told me as yet but one of them — let me hear the other . ” “ It was this , — that while you had related to me all the particulars of your past life , you were perfectly <unk> with mine . ” “ Your life , my young friend , has not been of sufficient length to admit of your having passed through any very important events . ” “ It has been long enough to <unk> on me a great and <unk> misfortune .
I would <unk> fix the source of it on man that I may no longer vent <unk> upon Heaven . ” “ Then you <unk> ignorance of the crime with which you are charged ? ” “ I do , indeed ; and this I swear by the two beings most dear to me upon earth , — my father and Mercédès . ” “ Come , ” said the abbé , closing his <unk> , and <unk> the bed back to its original situation , “ let me hear your story . ” Dantès obeyed , and <unk> what he called his history , but which consisted only of the account of a voyage to <unk> , and two or three <unk> to the <unk> , until he arrived at the <unk> of his last <unk> , with the death of Captain <unk> , and the receipt of a packet to be delivered by himself to the grand <unk> ; his interview with that personage , and his receiving , in place of the packet brought , a letter addressed to a Monsieur Noirtier — his arrival at Marseilles , and interview with his father — his affection for Mercédès , and their <unk> feast — his arrest and <unk> examination , his <unk> <unk> at the <unk> de <unk> , and his final <unk> in the Château d ’ If .
From this point everything was a <unk> to Dantès — he knew nothing more , not even the length of time he had been <unk> .
His <unk> finished , the abbé reflected long and earnestly .
“ There is , ” said he , at the end of his <unk> , “ a clever <unk> , which bears upon what I was saying to you some little while ago , and that is , that unless wicked ideas take <unk> in a naturally <unk> mind , human nature , in a right and <unk> state , <unk> at crime .
Still , from an <unk> civilization have <unk> wants , <unk> , and false <unk> , which occasionally become so powerful as to <unk> within us all good feelings , and <unk> to lead us into guilt and <unk> .
From this view of things , then , comes the <unk> that if you visit to discover the author of any bad action , seek first to discover the person to whom the <unk> of that bad action could be in any way <unk> .
Now , to apply it in your case , — to whom could your disappearance have been <unk> ? ” “ To no one , by Heaven !
I was a very <unk> person . ” “ Do not speak thus , for your reply <unk> neither <unk> nor philosophy ; everything is relative , my dear young friend , from the king who stands in the way of his <unk> , to the <unk> who keeps his <unk> out of a place .
Now , in the event of the king ’ s death , his <unk> <unk> a crown , — when the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> steps into his shoes , and <unk> his <unk> of twelve thousand livres .
Well , these twelve thousand livres are his civil list , and are as <unk> to him as the twelve millions of a king .
<unk> , from the highest to the <unk> degree , has his place on the social ladder , and is <unk> by stormy passions and <unk> interests , as in <unk> ’ theory of pressure and <unk> .
But these forces increase as we go higher , so that we have a <unk> which in <unk> of reason <unk> upon the <unk> and not on the base .
Now let us return to your particular world .
You say you were on the point of being made captain of the _ Pharaon _ ? ” “ Yes . ” “ And about to become the husband of a young and lovely girl ? ” “ Yes . ” “ Now , could anyone have had any interest in <unk> the <unk> of these two things ?
But let us first settle the question as to its being the interest of anyone to <unk> you from being captain of the _ Pharaon _ .
What say you ? ” “ I cannot believe such was the case .
I was generally liked on board , and had the sailors possessed the right of <unk> a captain themselves , I feel convinced their choice would have fallen on me .
There was only one person among the crew who had any feeling of <unk> towards me .
I had <unk> with him some time previously , and had even <unk> him to fight me ; but he refused . ” “ Now we are getting on .
And what was this man ’ s name ? ” “ Danglars . ” “ What rank did he hold on board ? ” “ He was <unk> . ” “ And had you been captain , should you have retained him in his employment ? ” “ Not if the choice had remained with me , for I had frequently observed <unk> in his accounts . ” “ Good again !
Now then , tell me , was any person present during your last conversation with Captain <unk> ? ” “ No ; we were quite alone . ” “ Could your conversation have been <unk> by anyone ? ” “ It might , for the <unk> door was open — and — stay ; now I recollect , — Danglars himself passed by just as Captain <unk> was giving me the packet for the grand <unk> . ” “ That ’ s better , ” cried the abbé ; “ now we are on the right scent .
Did you take anybody with you when you put into the port of Elba ? ” “ Nobody . ” “ <unk> there received your packet , and gave you a letter in place of it , I think ? ” “ Yes ; the grand <unk> did . ” “ And what did you do with that letter ? ” “ <unk> it into my <unk> . ” “ You had your <unk> with you , then ?
Now , how could a sailor find room in his pocket for a <unk> large enough to contain an official letter ? ” “ You are right ; it was left on board . ” “ Then it was not till your return to the ship that you put the letter in the <unk> ? ” “ No . ” “ And what did you do with this same letter while returning from <unk> to the vessel ? ” “ I carried it in my hand . ” “ So that when you went on board the _ Pharaon _ , everybody could see that you held a letter in your hand ? ” “ Yes . ” “ Danglars , as well as the rest ? ” “ Danglars , as well as others . ” “ Now , listen to me , and try to recall every circumstance attending your arrest .
Do you recollect the words in which the information against you was <unk> ? ” “ Oh yes , I read it over three times , and the words sank deeply into my memory . ” “ <unk> it to me . ” Dantès paused a moment , then said , “ This is it , word for word : ‘ The king ’ s attorney is informed by a friend to the throne and religion , that one Edmond Dantès , mate on board the _ Pharaon _ , this day arrived from <unk> , after having touched at Naples and <unk> , has been <unk> by <unk> with a packet for the usurper ; again , by the usurper , with a letter for the Bonapartist <unk> in Paris .
This proof of his guilt may be procured by his immediate arrest , as the letter will be found either about his person , at his father ’ s residence , or in his <unk> on board the _ Pharaon _ . ’ ” The abbé shrugged his shoulders .
“ The thing is clear as day , ” said he ; “ and you must have had a very <unk> nature , as well as a good heart , not to have suspected the origin of the whole affair . ” “ Do you really think so ?
Ah , that would indeed be infamous . ” “ How did Danglars usually write ? ” “ In a handsome , running hand . ” “ And how was the <unk> letter written ? ” “ <unk> . ” Again the abbé smiled .
“ <unk> . ” “ It was very <unk> written , if <unk> . ” “ Stop a bit , ” said the abbé , taking up what he called his pen , and , after <unk> it into the ink , he wrote on a piece of prepared linen , with his left hand , the first two or three words of the accusation .
Dantès drew back , and gazed on the abbé with a sensation almost <unk> to terror .
“ How very astonishing ! ” cried he at length .
“ Why your writing exactly resembles that of the accusation . ” “ <unk> because that accusation had been written with the left hand ; and I have noticed that — — ” “ What ? ” “ That while the writing of different persons done with the right hand <unk> , that performed with the left hand is <unk> uniform . ” “ You have evidently seen and observed everything . ” “ Let us proceed . ” “ Oh , yes , yes ! ” “ Now as <unk> the second question . ” “ I am listening . ” “ Was there any person whose interest it was to prevent your marriage with Mercédès ? ” “ Yes ; a young man who loved her . ” “ And his name was — — ” “ Fernand . ” “ That is a Spanish name , I think ? ” “ He was a <unk> . ” “ You imagine him capable of writing the letter ? ” “ Oh , no ; he would more likely have got rid of me by <unk> a knife into me . ” “ That is in strict accordance with the Spanish character ; an <unk> they will <unk> commit , but an act of <unk> , never . ” “ Besides , ” said Dantès , “ the various circumstances mentioned in the letter were wholly unknown to him . ” “ You had never spoken of them yourself to anyone ? ” “ To no one . ” “ Not even to your mistress ? ” “ No , not even to my betrothed . ” “ Then it is Danglars . ” “ I feel quite sure of it now . ” “ Wait a little .
Pray , was Danglars acquainted with Fernand ? ” “ No — yes , he was .
Now I recollect — — ” “ What ? ” “ To have seen them both sitting at table together under an <unk> at <unk> <unk> ’ s the evening before the day fixed for my wedding .
They were in earnest conversation .
Danglars was <unk> in a friendly way , but Fernand looked pale and agitated . ” “ Were they alone ? ” “ There was a third person with them whom I knew perfectly well , and who had , in all probability made their acquaintance ; he was a <unk> named Caderousse , but he was very drunk .
Stay ! — stay ! — How strange that it should not have occurred to me before !
Now I remember quite well , that on the table round which they were sitting were <unk> , ink , and paper .
Oh , the <unk> , <unk> <unk> ! ” exclaimed Dantès , pressing his hand to his <unk> <unk> .
“ Is there anything else I can assist you in <unk> , besides the <unk> of your friends ? ” inquired the abbé with a laugh .
“ Yes , yes , ” replied Dantès eagerly ; “ I would beg of you , who see so completely to the depths of things , and to whom the greatest mystery seems but an easy <unk> , to explain to me how it was that I <unk> no second examination , was never brought to trial , and , above all , was condemned without ever having had sentence passed on me ? ” “ That is altogether a different and more serious matter , ” responded the abbé .
“ The ways of justice are frequently too dark and mysterious to be easily penetrated .
All we have hitherto done in the matter has been child ’ s play .
If you wish me to enter upon the more difficult part of the business , you must assist me by the most minute information on every point . ” “ Pray ask me whatever questions you please ; for , in good truth , you see more clearly into my life than I do myself . ” “ In the first place , then , who examined you , — the king ’ s attorney , his deputy , or a magistrate ? ” “ The deputy . ” “ Was he young or old ? ” “ About six or <unk> years of age , I should say . ” “ So , ” answered the abbé .
“ Old enough to be <unk> , but too young to be <unk> .
And how did he treat you ? ” “ With more of <unk> than severity . ” “ Did you tell him your whole story ? ” “ I did . ” “ And did his conduct change at all in the course of your examination ? ” “ He did appear much disturbed when he read the letter that had brought me into this <unk> .
He seemed quite overcome by my misfortune . ” “ By your misfortune ? ” “ Yes . ” “ Then you feel quite sure that it was your misfortune he <unk> ? ” “ He gave me one great proof of his sympathy , at any rate . ” “ And that ? ” “ He burnt the sole evidence that could at all have <unk> me . ” “ What ?
the accusation ? ” “ No ; the letter . ” “ Are you sure ? ” “ I saw it done . ” “ That <unk> the case .
This man might , after all , be a greater <unk> than you have thought possible . ” “ Upon my word , ” said Dantès , “ you make me shudder .
Is the world filled with <unk> and <unk> ? ” “ Yes ; and remember that <unk> <unk> and <unk> are more dangerous than the others . ” “ Never mind ; let us go on . ” “ With all my heart !
You tell me he burned the letter ? ” “ He did ; saying at the same time , ‘ You see I thus destroy the only proof <unk> against you . ’ ” “ This action is somewhat too sublime to be natural . ” “ You think so ? ” “ I am sure of it .
To whom was this letter addressed ? ” “ To M. Noirtier , Rue <unk> , No .
<unk> , Paris . ” “ Now can you conceive of any interest that your heroic deputy could possibly have had in the destruction of that letter ? ” “ Why , it is not altogether impossible he might have had , for he made me promise several times never to speak of that letter to anyone , <unk> me he so <unk> me for my own interest ; and , more than this , he insisted on my taking a solemn oath never to utter the name mentioned in the address . ” “ Noirtier ! ” repeated the abbé ; “ Noirtier ! — I knew a person of that name at the court of the <unk> of <unk> , — a Noirtier , who had been a <unk> during the Revolution !
What was your deputy called ? ” “ De Villefort ! ” The abbé burst into a fit of laughter , while Dantès gazed on him in utter astonishment .
“ What <unk> you ? ” said he at length .
“ Do you see that ray of sunlight ? ” “ I do . ” “ Well , the whole thing is more clear to me than that <unk> is to you .
Poor fellow !
poor young man !
And you tell me this magistrate expressed great sympathy and <unk> for you ? ” “ He did . ” “ And the worthy man destroyed your <unk> letter ? ” “ Yes . ” “ And then made you swear never to utter the name of Noirtier ? ” “ Yes . ” “ Why , you poor <unk> <unk> , can you not guess who this Noirtier was , whose very name he was so careful to keep concealed ?
This Noirtier was his father ! ” Had a <unk> fallen at the feet of Dantès , or hell opened its <unk> gulf before him , he could not have been more completely <unk> with horror than he was at the sound of these unexpected words .
<unk> up , he clasped his hands around his head as though to prevent his very brain from <unk> , and exclaimed , “ His father !
his father ! ” “ Yes , his father , ” replied the abbé ; “ his right name was Noirtier de Villefort . ” At this instant a bright light shot through the mind of Dantès , and cleared up all that had been dark and obscure before .
The change that had come over Villefort during the examination , the destruction of the letter , the <unk> promise , the almost <unk> tones of the magistrate , who seemed rather to <unk> mercy than to pronounce punishment , — all returned with a <unk> force to his memory .
He cried out , and <unk> against the wall like a <unk> man , then he hurried to the opening that led from the abbé ’ s cell to his own , and said , “ I must be alone , to think over all this . ” When he regained his dungeon , he threw himself on his bed , where the turnkey found him in the evening visit , sitting with fixed gaze and contracted features , <unk> and motionless as a statue .
During these hours of profound meditation , which to him had seemed only minutes , he had formed a fearful resolution , and bound himself to its <unk> by a solemn oath .
Dantès was at length roused from his reverie by the voice of Faria , who , having also been visited by his jailer , had come to invite his <unk> to share his supper .
The reputation of being out of his mind , though <unk> and even <unk> so , had procured for the abbé unusual <unk> .
He was supplied with bread of a <unk> , <unk> quality than the usual prison <unk> , and even <unk> each Sunday with a small quantity of wine .
Now this was a Sunday , and the abbé had come to ask his young companion to share the <unk> with him .
Dantès followed him ; his features were no longer contracted , and now wore their usual expression , but there was that in his whole appearance that <unk> one who had come to a fixed and desperate resolve .
Faria bent on him his penetrating eye .
“ I regret now , ” said he , “ having helped you in your late inquiries , or having given you the information I did . ” “ Why so ? ” inquired Dantès .
“ Because it has <unk> a new passion in your heart — that of vengeance . ” Dantès smiled .
“ Let us talk of something else , ” said he .
Again the abbé looked at him , then <unk> shook his head ; but in accordance with Dantès ’ request , he began to speak of other matters .
The elder prisoner was one of those persons whose conversation , like that of all who have experienced many <unk> , contained many useful and important <unk> as well as sound information ; but it was never <unk> , for the unfortunate man never <unk> to his own sorrows .
Dantès listened with <unk> attention to all he said ; some of his remarks <unk> with what he already knew , or applied to the sort of knowledge his <unk> life had enabled him to <unk> .
A part of the good abbé ’ s words , however , were wholly <unk> to him ; but , like the <unk> which <unk> the <unk> in <unk> <unk> , opened new <unk> to the <unk> mind of the <unk> , and gave fantastic <unk> of new <unk> , <unk> him <unk> to <unk> the delight an intellectual mind would have in following one so <unk> <unk> as Faria along the <unk> of truth , where he was so much at home .
“ You must teach me a small part of what you know , ” said Dantès , “ if only to prevent your growing weary of me .
I can well believe that so learned a person as yourself would prefer absolute solitude to being <unk> with the company of one as ignorant and <unk> as myself .
If you will only agree to my request , I promise you never to mention another word about <unk> . ” The abbé smiled .
“ Alas , my boy , ” said he , “ human knowledge is confined within very narrow <unk> ; and when I have taught you <unk> , <unk> , history , and the three or four modern <unk> with which I am acquainted , you will know as much as I do myself .
Now , it will scarcely require two years for me to communicate to you the stock of <unk> I possess . ” “ Two years ! ” exclaimed Dantès ; “ do you really believe I can <unk> all these things in so short a time ? ” “ Not their application , certainly , but their principles you may ; to learn is not to know ; there are the <unk> and the learned .
<unk> makes the one , philosophy the other . ” “ But cannot one learn philosophy ? ” “ <unk> cannot be taught ; it is the application of the <unk> to truth ; it is like the golden cloud in which the <unk> went up into heaven . ” “ Well , then , ” said Dantès , “ What shall you teach me first ?
I am in a hurry to begin .
I want to learn . ” “ Everything , ” said the abbé .
And that very evening the prisoners <unk> a plan of education , to be entered upon the following day .
Dantès possessed a prodigious memory , combined with an astonishing <unk> and readiness of <unk> ; the <unk> turn of his mind rendered him <unk> at all <unk> of <unk> , while his naturally <unk> feelings threw a light and pleasing veil over the dry reality of <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> severity of <unk> .
He already knew Italian , and had also picked up a little of the <unk> <unk> during <unk> to the East ; and by the aid of these two <unk> he easily comprehended the construction of all the others , so that at the end of six months he began to speak Spanish , English , and German .
In strict accordance with the promise made to the abbé , Dantès spoke no more of escape .
Perhaps the delight his studies afforded him left no room for such thoughts ; perhaps the recollection that he had <unk> his word ( on which his sense of honor was <unk> ) kept him from <unk> in any way to the <unk> of flight .
<unk> , even months , passed by <unk> in one rapid and <unk> course .
At the end of a year Dantès was a new man .
Dantès observed , however , that Faria , in spite of the relief his society afforded , daily grew <unk> ; one thought seemed incessantly to <unk> and <unk> his mind .
Sometimes he would fall into long <unk> , sigh heavily and <unk> , then suddenly rise , and , with folded arms , begin <unk> the confined space of his dungeon .
One day he stopped all at once , and exclaimed : “ Ah , if there were no sentinel ! ” “ There shall not be one a minute longer than you please , ” said Dantès , who had followed the working of his thoughts as <unk> as though his brain were <unk> in <unk> so clear as to display its <unk> <unk> .
“ I have already told you , ” answered the abbé , “ that I <unk> the idea of <unk> blood . ” “ And yet the murder , if you choose to call it so , would be simply a measure of <unk> . ” “ No matter !
I could never agree to it . ” “ Still , you have thought of it ? ” “ <unk> , alas ! ” cried the abbé .
“ And you have discovered a means of <unk> our freedom , have you not ? ” asked Dantès eagerly .
“ I have ; if it were only possible to place a <unk> and blind sentinel in the gallery beyond us . ” “ He shall be both blind and <unk> , ” replied the young man , with an air of determination that made his companion shudder .
“ No , no , ” cried the abbé ; “ impossible ! ” Dantès endeavored to <unk> the subject ; the abbé shook his head in <unk> of <unk> , and refused to make any further <unk> .
Three months passed away .
“ Are you strong ? ” the abbé asked one day of Dantès .
The young man , in reply , took up the <unk> , bent it into the form of a <unk> , and then as readily <unk> it .
“ And will you engage not to do any harm to the <unk> , except as a last <unk> ? ” “ I promise on my honor . ” “ Then , ” said the abbé , “ we may hope to put our design into execution . ” “ And how long shall we be in <unk> the necessary work ? ” “ At least a year . ” “ And shall we begin at once ? ” “ At once . ” “ We have lost a year to no purpose ! ” cried Dantès .
“ Do you consider the last twelve months to have been <unk> ? ” asked the abbé .
“ <unk> me ! ” cried Edmond , <unk> deeply .
“ <unk> , <unk> ! ” answered the abbé , “ man is but man after all , and you are about the best <unk> of the <unk> I have ever known .
Come , let me show you my plan . ” The abbé then showed Dantès the <unk> he had made for their escape .
It consisted of a plan of his own cell and that of Dantès , with the passage which united them .
In this passage he proposed to drive a level as they do in <unk> ; this level would bring the two prisoners immediately beneath the gallery where the <unk> kept watch ; once there , a large <unk> would be made , and one of the <unk> with which the gallery was <unk> be so completely <unk> that at the desired moment it would give way beneath the feet of the soldier , who , <unk> by his fall , would be immediately bound and <unk> by Dantès before he had power to offer any resistance .
The prisoners were then to make their way through one of the gallery windows , and to let themselves down from the outer walls by means of the abbé ’ s ladder of <unk> .
Dantès ’ eyes <unk> with joy , and he <unk> his hands with delight at the idea of a plan so simple , yet apparently so certain to succeed .
That very day the <unk> began their <unk> , with a <unk> and <unk> <unk> to their long rest from fatigue and their hopes of <unk> success .
Nothing interrupted the progress of the work except the necessity that each was under of returning to his cell in <unk> of the turnkey ’ s visits .
They had learned to distinguish the almost imperceptible sound of his footsteps as he descended towards their <unk> , and happily , never failed of being prepared for his coming .
The fresh earth <unk> during their present work , and which would have entirely <unk> up the old passage , was thrown , by degrees and with the utmost precaution , out of the window in either Faria ’ s or Dantès ’ cell , the rubbish being first <unk> so <unk> that the night wind carried it far away without <unk> the smallest trace to remain .
More than a year had been <unk> in this <unk> , the only tools for which had been a <unk> , a knife , and a wooden <unk> ; Faria still <unk> to <unk> Dantès by conversing with him , sometimes in one language , sometimes in another ; at others , relating to him the history of nations and great men who from time to time have risen to <unk> and <unk> the path of glory .
The abbé was a man of the world , and had , moreover , mixed in the first society of the day ; he wore an air of melancholy dignity which Dantès , thanks to the <unk> powers bestowed on him by nature , easily acquired , as well as that <unk> <unk> and politeness he had before been wanting in , and which is seldom possessed except by those who have been placed in constant intercourse with persons of high birth and <unk> .
At the end of fifteen months the level was finished , and the <unk> completed beneath the gallery , and the two <unk> could distinctly hear the measured tread of the sentinel as he <unk> to and fro over their heads .
<unk> , as they were , to await a night sufficiently dark to favor their flight , they were obliged to <unk> their final attempt till that <unk> moment should arrive ; their greatest dread now was lest the stone through which the <unk> was <unk> to fall should give way before its right time , and this they had in some measure provided against by <unk> it up with a small <unk> which they had discovered in the walls through which they had worked their way .
Dantès was occupied in arranging this piece of wood when he heard Faria , who had remained in Edmond ’ s cell for the purpose of cutting a <unk> to secure their <unk> , call to him in a tone <unk> of great suffering .
Dantès hastened to his dungeon , where he found him standing in the middle of the room , pale as death , his forehead <unk> with perspiration , and his hands clenched <unk> together .
“ <unk> heavens ! ” exclaimed Dantès , “ what is the matter ?
what has happened ? ” “ <unk> !
quick ! ” returned the abbé , “ listen to what I have to say . ” Dantès looked in fear and wonder at the livid countenance of Faria , whose eyes , already dull and <unk> , were surrounded by purple <unk> , while his lips were white as those of a corpse , and his very hair seemed to stand on end .
“ Tell me , I <unk> you , what <unk> you ? ” cried Dantès , letting his <unk> fall to the floor .
“ Alas , ” <unk> out the abbé , “ all is over with me .
I am seized with a terrible , perhaps mortal illness ; I can feel that the <unk> is fast approaching .
I had a similar attack the year previous to my <unk> .
This malady <unk> but of one remedy ; I will tell you what that is .
Go into my cell as quickly as you can ; draw out one of the feet that support the bed ; you will find it has been <unk> out for the purpose of containing a small <unk> you will see there <unk> with a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> it to me — or rather — no , no ! — I may be found here , therefore help me back to my room while I have the strength to drag myself along .
Who knows what may happen , or how long the attack may last ? ” In spite of the <unk> of the misfortune which thus suddenly <unk> his hopes , Dantès did not lose his presence of mind , but descended into the passage , dragging his unfortunate companion with him ; then , <unk> , <unk> him , he managed to reach the abbé ’ s chamber , when he immediately laid the <unk> on his bed .
“ Thanks , ” said the poor abbé , shivering as though his veins were filled with ice .
“ I am about to be seized with a fit of <unk> ; when it comes to its height I shall probably lie still and motionless as though dead , uttering neither sigh nor groan .
On the other hand , the symptoms may be much more violent , and cause me to fall into fearful <unk> , <unk> at the mouth , and cry out loudly .
Take care my cries are not heard , for if they are it is more than probable I should be removed to another part of the prison , and we be separated forever .
When I become quite motionless , cold , and <unk> as a corpse , then , and not before , — be careful about this , — force open my teeth with the knife , <unk> from eight to ten drops of the <unk> contained in the <unk> down my throat , and I may perhaps <unk> . ” “ Perhaps ! ” exclaimed Dantès in <unk> tones .
“ <unk> !
help ! ” cried the abbé , “ I — I — die — I — — ” <unk> So sudden and violent was the fit that the unfortunate prisoner was unable to complete the sentence ; a violent <unk> shook his whole frame , his eyes started from their <unk> , his mouth was drawn on one side , his cheeks became purple , he struggled , <unk> , dashed himself about , and uttered the most dreadful cries , which , however , Dantès prevented from being heard by <unk> his head with the <unk> .
The fit lasted two hours ; then , more helpless than an infant , and <unk> and <unk> than marble , more crushed and broken than a <unk> <unk> under foot , he fell back , <unk> up in one last <unk> , and became as <unk> as a corpse .
Edmond waited till life seemed <unk> in the body of his friend , then , taking up the knife , he with difficulty forced open the closely fixed <unk> , carefully <unk> the appointed number of drops , and anxiously awaited the result .
An hour passed away and the old man gave no sign of returning animation .
Dantès began to fear he had delayed too long ere he <unk> the remedy , and , <unk> his hands into his hair , continued gazing on the <unk> features of his friend .
At length a slight color <unk> the livid cheeks , consciousness returned to the dull , open <unk> , a faint sigh <unk> from the lips , and the <unk> made a feeble effort to move .
“ He is saved !
he is saved ! ” cried Dantès in a <unk> of delight .
The sick man was not yet able to speak , but he pointed with evident anxiety towards the door .
Dantès listened , and plainly distinguished the approaching steps of the jailer .
It was therefore near seven o ’ clock ; but Edmond ’ s anxiety had put all thoughts of time out of his head .
The young man sprang to the entrance , darted through it , carefully drawing the stone over the opening , and hurried to his cell .
He had scarcely done so before the door opened , and the jailer saw the prisoner seated as usual on the side of his bed .
<unk> before the key had turned in the lock , and before the <unk> steps of the jailer had died away in the long corridor he had to traverse , Dantès , whose <unk> anxiety concerning his friend left him no desire to touch the food brought him , hurried back to the abbé ’ s chamber , and raising the stone by pressing his head against it , was soon beside the sick man ’ s <unk> .
Faria had now fully regained his consciousness , but he still lay helpless and exhausted on his miserable bed .
“ I did not expect to see you again , ” said he <unk> , to Dantès .
“ And why not ? ” asked the young man .
“ Did you fancy yourself dying ? ” “ No , I had no such idea ; but , knowing that all was ready for flight , I thought you might have made your escape . ” The deep glow of indignation <unk> the cheeks of Dantès .
“ Without you ?
Did you really think me capable of that ? ” “ At least , ” said the abbé , “ I now see how wrong such an opinion would have been .
Alas , alas !
I am <unk> exhausted and <unk> by this attack . ” “ Be of good <unk> , ” replied Dantès ; “ your strength will return . ” And as he spoke he seated himself near the bed beside Faria , and took his hands .
The abbé shook his head .
“ The last attack I had , ” said he , “ lasted but half an hour , and after it I was hungry , and got up without help ; now I can move neither my right arm nor leg , and my head seems <unk> , which shows that there has been a <unk> of blood on the brain .
The third attack will either carry me off , or leave me <unk> for life . ” “ No , no , ” cried Dantès ; “ you are mistaken — you will not die !
And your third attack ( if , indeed , you should have another ) will find you at liberty .
We shall save you another time , as we have done this , only with a better chance of success , because we shall be able to command every requisite assistance . ” “ My good Edmond , ” answered the abbé , “ be not deceived .
The attack which has just passed away , <unk> me forever to the walls of a prison .
None can fly from a dungeon who cannot walk . ” “ Well , we will wait , — a week , a month , two months , if need be , — and meanwhile your strength will return .
Everything is in readiness for our flight , and we can <unk> any time we choose .
As soon as you feel able to <unk> we will go . ” “ I shall never <unk> again , ” replied Faria .
“ This arm is <unk> ; not for a time , but forever .
<unk> it , and judge if I am mistaken . ” The young man raised the arm , which fell back by its own weight , perfectly <unk> and helpless .
A sigh escaped him .
“ You are convinced now , Edmond , are you not ? ” asked the abbé .
“ <unk> upon it , I know what I say .
Since the first attack I experienced of this malady , I have continually reflected on it .
Indeed , I expected it , for it is a family <unk> ; both my father and grandfather died of it in a third attack .
The physician who prepared for me the remedy I have twice <unk> taken , was no other than the celebrated <unk> , and he <unk> a similar end for me . ” <unk> “ The physician may be mistaken ! ” exclaimed Dantès .
“ And as for your poor arm , what difference will that make ?
I can take you on my shoulders , and <unk> for both of us . ” “ My son , ” said the abbé , “ you , who are a sailor and a <unk> , must know as well as I do that a man so loaded would sink before he had done fifty <unk> .
<unk> , then , to allow yourself to be <unk> by vain hopes , that even your own excellent heart <unk> to believe in .
Here I shall remain till the hour of my <unk> arrives , and that , in all human probability , will be the hour of my death .
As for you , who are young and active , delay not on my account , but fly — go — I give you back your promise . ” “ It is well , ” said Dantès .
“ Then I shall also remain . ” Then , rising and extending his hand with an air of solemnity over the old man ’ s head , he slowly added , “ By the blood of Christ I swear never to leave you while you live . ” Faria gazed <unk> on his <unk> , <unk> , <unk> young friend , and read in his countenance <unk> <unk> of the sincerity of his devotion and the <unk> of his purpose .
“ Thanks , ” murmured the invalid , extending one hand .
“ I accept .
You may one of these days <unk> the <unk> of your <unk> devotion .
But as I cannot , and you will not , quit this place , it becomes necessary to fill up the <unk> beneath the soldier ’ s gallery ; he might , by chance , hear the hollow sound of his footsteps , and call the attention of his officer to the circumstance .
That would bring about a discovery which would <unk> lead to our being separated .
Go , then , and set about this work , in which , <unk> , I can offer you no assistance ; keep at it all night , if necessary , and do not return here tomorrow till after the jailer has visited me .
I shall have something of the greatest importance to communicate to you . ” Dantès took the hand of the abbé in his , and <unk> pressed it .
Faria smiled <unk> on him , and the young man retired to his task , in the spirit of obedience and respect which he had <unk> to show towards his aged friend .
Chapter 18 .
The <unk> When Dantès returned next morning to the chamber of his companion in <unk> , he found Faria seated and looking composed .
In the ray of light which entered by the narrow window of his cell , he held open in his left hand , of which alone , it will be recollected , he retained the use , a sheet of paper , which , from being constantly rolled into a small <unk> , had the form of a <unk> , and was not easily kept open .
He did not speak , but showed the paper to Dantès .
“ What is that ? ” he inquired .
“ Look at it , ” said the abbé with a smile .
“ I have looked at it with all possible attention , ” said Dantès , “ and I only see a <unk> paper , on which are traces of <unk> characters <unk> with a peculiar kind of ink . ” “ This paper , my friend , ” said Faria , “ I may now <unk> to you , since I have the proof of your <unk> — this paper is my treasure , of which , from this day forth , <unk> belongs to you . ” The <unk> started forth on Dantès ’ brow .
<unk> this day and for how long a time ! — he had <unk> from talking of the treasure , which had brought upon the abbé the accusation of madness .
With his <unk> delicacy Edmond had preferred <unk> any touch on this painful <unk> , and Faria had been equally silent .
He had taken the silence of the old man for a return to reason ; and now these few words uttered by Faria , after so painful a crisis , seemed to indicate a serious <unk> into mental <unk> .
“ Your treasure ? ” stammered Dantès .
Faria smiled .
“ Yes , ” said he .
“ You have , indeed , a noble nature , Edmond , and I see by your <unk> and agitation what is passing in your heart at this moment .
No , be assured , I am not mad .
This treasure exists , Dantès , and if I have not been allowed to possess it , you will .
Yes — you .
No one would listen or believe me , because everyone thought me mad ; but you , who must know that I am not , listen to me , and believe me so afterwards if you will . ” “ Alas , ” murmured Edmond to himself , “ this is a terrible <unk> !
There was only this blow wanting . ” Then he said aloud , “ My dear friend , your attack has , perhaps , fatigued you ; had you not better repose <unk> ?
<unk> , if you will , I will hear your <unk> ; but today I wish to nurse you carefully .
Besides , ” he said , “ a treasure is not a thing we need hurry about . ” “ On the contrary , it is a matter of the utmost importance , Edmond ! ” replied the old man .
“ Who knows if tomorrow , or the next day after , the third attack may not come on ?
and then must not all be over ?
Yes , indeed , I have often thought with a bitter joy that these riches , which would make the wealth of a dozen families , will be forever lost to those men who <unk> me .
This idea was one of vengeance to me , and I <unk> it slowly in the night of my dungeon and the despair of my <unk> .
But now I have <unk> the world for the love of you ; now that I see you , young and with a <unk> future , — now that I think of all that may result to you in the good fortune of such a <unk> , I shudder at any delay , and tremble lest I should not assure to one as worthy as yourself the possession of so vast an amount of hidden wealth . ” Edmond turned away his head with a sigh .
“ You <unk> in your <unk> , Edmond , ” continued Faria .
“ My words have not convinced you .
I see you require proofs .
Well , then , read this paper , which I have never shown to anyone . ” “ <unk> , my dear friend , ” said Edmond , desirous of not <unk> to the old man ’ s madness .
“ I thought it was understood that we should not talk of that until tomorrow . ” “ Then we will not talk of it until tomorrow ; but read this paper today . ” “ I will not <unk> him , ” thought Edmond , and taking the paper , of which half was wanting , — having been burnt , no doubt , by some accident , — he read : “ this treasure , which may amount to two ... of Roman crowns in the most distant a ... of the second opening <unk> ... declare to belong to him <unk> ... heir .
“ <unk> April , <unk> ’ ” “ Well ! ” said Faria , when the young man had finished reading it .
“ Why , ” replied Dantès , “ I see nothing but broken lines and <unk> words , which are rendered <unk> by fire . ” “ Yes , to you , my friend , who read them for the first time ; but not for me , who have grown pale over them by many nights ’ study , and have <unk> every phrase , completed every thought . ” “ And do you believe you have discovered the hidden meaning ? ” “ I am sure I have , and you shall judge for yourself ; but first listen to the history of this paper . ” “ Silence ! ” exclaimed Dantès .
“ <unk> approach — I go — adieu ! ” And Dantès , happy to escape the history and explanation which would be sure to <unk> his belief in his friend ’ s mental <unk> , <unk> like a <unk> along the narrow passage ; while Faria , restored by his alarm to a certain amount of activity , pushed the stone into place with his foot , and covered it with a <unk> in order the more <unk> to avoid discovery .
It was the governor , who , hearing of Faria ’ s illness from the jailer , had come in person to see him .
Faria sat up to receive him , <unk> all <unk> in order that he might conceal from the governor the <unk> that had already half <unk> him with death .
His fear was lest the governor , touched with pity , might order him to be removed to better quarters , and thus separate him from his young companion .
But fortunately this was not the case , and the governor left him , convinced that the poor madman , for whom in his heart he felt a kind of affection , was only troubled with a slight <unk> .
During this time , Edmond , seated on his bed with his head in his hands , tried to collect his scattered thoughts .
Faria , since their first acquaintance , had been on all points so rational and <unk> , so <unk> <unk> , in fact , that he could not understand how so much wisdom on all points could be <unk> with madness .
Was Faria deceived as to his treasure , or was all the world deceived as to Faria ?
Dantès remained in his cell all day , not daring to return to his friend , thinking thus to <unk> the moment when he should be convinced , once for all , that the abbé was mad — such a conviction would be so terrible !
But , towards the evening after the hour for the <unk> visit had gone by , Faria , not seeing the young man appear , tried to move and get over the distance which separated them .
Edmond shuddered when he heard the painful efforts which the old man made to drag himself along ; his leg was <unk> , and he could no longer make use of one arm .
Edmond was obliged to assist him , for otherwise he would not have been able to enter by the small aperture which led to Dantès ’ chamber .
“ Here I am , pursuing you <unk> , ” he said with a <unk> smile .
“ You thought to escape my <unk> , but it is in vain .
Listen to me . ” Edmond saw there was no escape , and placing the old man on his bed , he seated himself on the <unk> beside him .
“ You know , ” said the abbé , “ that I was the secretary and intimate friend of Cardinal Spada , the last of the <unk> of that name .
I owe to this worthy lord all the happiness I ever knew .
He was not rich , although the wealth of his family had passed into a <unk> , and I heard the phrase very often , ‘ As rich as a Spada . ’ But he , like public <unk> , lived on this reputation for wealth ; his palace was my paradise .
I was <unk> to his <unk> , who are dead ; and when he was alone in the world , I tried by absolute devotion to his will , to make up to him all he had done for me during ten years of <unk> kindness .
The <unk> ’ s house had no secrets for me .
I had often seen my noble patron <unk> ancient <unk> , and eagerly searching amongst <unk> family <unk> .
One day when I was <unk> him for his <unk> <unk> , and <unk> the <unk> of mind that followed them , he looked at me , and , smiling bitterly , opened a volume relating to the <unk> of the <unk> of Rome .
There , in the <unk> <unk> of the Life of <unk> Alexander <unk> . , were the following lines , which I can never forget : — “ ‘ The great <unk> of <unk> had ended ; Cæsar <unk> , who had completed his <unk> , had need of money to purchase all Italy .
The <unk> had also need of money to bring matters to an end with Louis <unk> .
King of France , who was formidable still in spite of his recent <unk> ; and it was necessary , therefore , to have <unk> to some <unk> scheme , which was a matter of great difficulty in the <unk> condition of exhausted Italy .
His <unk> had an idea .
He determined to make two <unk> . ’ “ By <unk> two of the greatest <unk> of Rome , especially rich men — _ this _ was the return the Holy Father looked for .
In the first place , he could sell the great <unk> and splendid <unk> which the <unk> already held ; and then he had the two <unk> to sell besides .
There was a third point in view , which will appear <unk> .
“ The <unk> and Cæsar <unk> first found the two future <unk> ; they were <unk> <unk> , who held four of the highest <unk> of the Holy See , and Cæsar Spada , one of the <unk> and <unk> of the Roman nobility ; both felt the high honor of such a favor from the <unk> .
They were <unk> , and Cæsar <unk> soon found <unk> for their <unk> .
The result was , that <unk> and Spada paid for being <unk> , and eight other persons paid for the <unk> the <unk> held before their <unk> , and thus eight hundred thousand crowns entered into the <unk> of the <unk> .
<unk> “ It is time now to proceed to the last part of the <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> attentions upon <unk> and Spada , <unk> upon them the <unk> of the <unk> , and induced them to arrange their affairs and take up their residence at Rome .
Then the <unk> and Cæsar <unk> invited the two <unk> to dinner .
This was a matter of <unk> between the Holy Father and his son .
Cæsar thought they could make use of one of the means which he always had ready for his friends , that is to say , in the first place , the famous key which was given to certain persons with the request that they go and open a designated cupboard .
This key was furnished with a small iron point , — a <unk> on the part of the <unk> .
When this was pressed to effect the opening of the cupboard , of which the lock was difficult , the person was <unk> by this small point , and died next day .
Then there was the ring with the lion ’ s head , which Cæsar wore when he wanted to <unk> his friends with a <unk> of the hand .
The lion bit the hand thus <unk> , and at the end of <unk> hours , the <unk> was mortal .
“ Cæsar proposed to his father , that they should either ask the <unk> to open the cupboard , or shake hands with them ; but Alexander <unk> .
replied : ‘ Now as to the worthy <unk> , Spada and <unk> , let us ask both of them to dinner , something tells me that we shall get that money back .
Besides , you forget , Cæsar , an <unk> <unk> itself immediately , while a <unk> or a <unk> occasions a delay of a day or two . ’ Cæsar gave way before such <unk> reasoning , and the <unk> were consequently invited to dinner .
“ The table was laid in a <unk> belonging to the <unk> , near <unk> <unk> , a charming retreat which the <unk> knew very well by report .
<unk> , quite set up with his new <unk> , went with a good appetite and his most <unk> manner .
Spada , a prudent man , and greatly attached to his only nephew , a young captain of the highest promise , took paper and pen , and made his will .
He then sent word to his nephew to wait for him near the <unk> ; but it appeared the servant did not find him .
“ Spada knew what these <unk> meant ; since <unk> , so <unk> <unk> , had made progress in Rome , it was no longer a <unk> who came from the <unk> with a message , ‘ Cæsar <unk> that you die . ’ but it was a <unk> _ à <unk> _ , who came with a smile on his lips to say from the <unk> , ‘ His <unk> <unk> you to dine with him . ’ “ Spada set out about two o ’ clock to <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> awaited him .
The first sight that attracted the eyes of Spada was that of his nephew , in full costume , and Cæsar <unk> paying him most marked attentions .
Spada turned pale , as Cæsar looked at him with an <unk> air , which proved that he had anticipated all , and that the <unk> was well spread .
“ They began dinner and Spada was only able to inquire of his nephew if he had received his message .
The nephew replied no ; perfectly <unk> the meaning of the question .
It was too late , for he had already drunk a glass of excellent wine , placed for him <unk> by the <unk> ’ s <unk> .
Spada at the same moment saw another bottle approach him , which he was pressed to taste .
An hour afterwards a physician declared they were both <unk> through eating <unk> .
Spada died on the threshold of the <unk> ; the nephew <unk> at his own door , making signs which his wife could not comprehend .
“ Then Cæsar and the <unk> hastened to lay hands on the <unk> , under <unk> of seeking for the papers of the dead man .
But the <unk> consisted in this only , a <unk> of paper on which Spada had written : — ‘ I <unk> to my beloved nephew my <unk> , my books , and , amongst others , my <unk> with the gold corners , which I beg he will preserve in remembrance of his affectionate uncle . ’ “ The <unk> sought everywhere , admired the <unk> , laid hands on the furniture , and were greatly astonished that Spada , the rich man , was really the most miserable of <unk> — no treasures — unless they were those of science , contained in the library and <unk> .
That was all .
Cæsar and his father searched , examined , scrutinized , but found nothing , or at least very little ; not <unk> a few thousand crowns in plate , and about the same in ready money ; but the nephew had time to say to his wife before he <unk> : ‘ Look well among my uncle ’ s papers ; there is a will . ’ “ They sought even more thoroughly than the august <unk> had done , but it was <unk> .
There were two <unk> and a <unk> behind the <unk> Hill ; but in these days landed property had not much value , and the two <unk> and the <unk> remained to the family since they were beneath the <unk> of the <unk> and his son .
<unk> and years rolled on .
Alexander <unk> .
died , <unk> , — you know by what mistake .
Cæsar , <unk> at the same time , escaped by <unk> his skin like a <unk> ; but the new skin was <unk> by the poison till it looked like a tiger ’ s .
Then , compelled to quit Rome , he went and got himself <unk> killed in a night <unk> , scarcely noticed in history .
“ After the <unk> ’ s death and his son ’ s <unk> , it was supposed that the Spada family would <unk> the splendid position they had held before the <unk> ’ s time ; but this was not the case .
The <unk> remained in doubtful ease , a mystery hung over this dark affair , and the public <unk> was , that Cæsar , a better <unk> than his father , had carried off from the <unk> the fortune of the two <unk> .
I say the two , because Cardinal <unk> , who had not taken any precaution , was completely <unk> .
“ <unk> to this point , ” said Faria , <unk> the thread of his <unk> , “ this seems to you very <unk> , no doubt , <unk> ? ” “ Oh , my friend , ” cried Dantès , “ on the contrary , it seems as if I were reading a most interesting <unk> ; go on , I beg of you . ” “ I will .
The family began to get accustomed to their obscurity .
<unk> rolled on , and amongst the <unk> some were soldiers , others <unk> ; some <unk> , some <unk> ; some grew rich , and some were ruined .
I come now to the last of the family , whose secretary I was — the Count of Spada .
I had often heard him complain of the <unk> of his rank with his fortune ; and I <unk> him to <unk> all he had in an <unk> .
He did so , and thus <unk> his income .
The celebrated <unk> remained in the family , and was in the count ’ s possession .
It had been handed down from father to son ; for the singular <unk> of the only will that had been found , had caused it to be regarded as a genuine <unk> , preserved in the family with <unk> <unk> .
It was an illuminated book , with beautiful <unk> characters , and so <unk> with gold , that a servant always carried it before the <unk> on days of great solemnity .
“ At the sight of papers of all sorts , — <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , which were kept in the <unk> of the family , all descending from the <unk> <unk> , I in my turn examined the immense <unk> of documents , like twenty <unk> , <unk> , <unk> before me ; but in spite of the most <unk> <unk> , I found — nothing .
Yet I had read , I had even written a precise history of the <unk> family , for the sole purpose of <unk> myself whether any increase of fortune had occurred to them on the death of the Cardinal Cæsar Spada ; but could only trace the <unk> of the property of the Cardinal <unk> , his companion in misfortune .
“ I was then almost assured that the <unk> had neither <unk> the <unk> nor the family , but had remained <unk> like the treasures of the Arabian <unk> , which slept in the bosom of the earth under the eyes of the <unk> .
I searched , <unk> , counted , calculated a thousand and a thousand times the income and <unk> of the family for three hundred years .
It was useless .
I remained in my ignorance , and the Count of Spada in his poverty .
“ My patron died .
He had reserved from his <unk> his family papers , his library , composed of five thousand <unk> , and his famous <unk> .
All these he <unk> to me , with a thousand Roman crowns , which he had in ready money , on condition that I would have <unk> masses said for the repose of his soul , and that I would draw up a <unk> tree and history of his house .
All this I did <unk> .
Be easy , my dear Edmond , we are near the conclusion .
“ In <unk> , a month before I was arrested , and a fortnight after the death of the Count of Spada , on the <unk> of <unk> ( you will see presently how the date became fixed in my memory ) , I was reading , for the <unk> time , the papers I was arranging , for the palace was sold to a stranger , and I was going to leave Rome and settle at <unk> , intending to take with me twelve thousand francs I possessed , my library , and the famous <unk> , when , tired with my constant labor at the same thing , and overcome by a heavy dinner I had eaten , my head dropped on my hands , and I fell asleep about three o ’ clock in the afternoon .
<unk> “ I awoke as the clock was striking six .
I raised my head ; I was in utter darkness .
I rang for a light , but , as no one came , I determined to find one for myself .
It was indeed but <unk> the simple manners which I should soon be under the necessity of <unk> .
I took a <unk> in one hand , and with the other <unk> about for a piece of paper ( my <unk> being empty ) , with which I proposed to get a light from the small flame still playing on the <unk> .
<unk> , however , to make use of any valuable piece of paper , I hesitated for a moment , then recollected that I had seen in the famous <unk> , which was on the table beside me , an old paper quite yellow with age , and which had served as a <unk> for centuries , kept there by the request of the <unk> .
I felt for it , found it , <unk> it up together , and putting it into the <unk> flame , set light to it .
“ But beneath my fingers , as if by <unk> , in proportion as the fire ascended , I saw <unk> characters appear on the paper .
I grasped it in my hand , put out the flame as quickly as I could , lighted my <unk> in the fire itself , and opened the <unk> paper with <unk> emotion , <unk> , when I had done so , that these characters had been traced in mysterious and <unk> ink , only appearing when exposed to the fire ; nearly <unk> of the paper had been <unk> by the flame .
It was that paper you read this morning ; read it again , Dantès , and then I will complete for you the incomplete words and <unk> sense . ” Faria , with an air of triumph , offered the paper to Dantès , who this time read the following words , traced with an ink of a <unk> color resembling <unk> : “ This <unk> day of April , <unk> , be ... Alexander <unk> . , and fearing that not ... he may desire to become my heir , and re ... and <unk> , who were <unk> , ... my sole heir , that I have <unk> ... and has visited with me , that is , in ... Island of Monte Cristo , all I <unk> ... jewels , diamonds , <unk> ; that I alone ... may amount to nearly two <unk> ... will find on raising the <unk> <unk> ... <unk> to the <unk> in a right line .
Two open ... in these <unk> ; the treasure is in the <unk> a ... which treasure I <unk> and leave en ... as my sole heir .
“ <unk> April , <unk> .
“ <unk> ... “ And now , ” said the abbé , “ read this other paper ; ” and he presented to Dantès a second <unk> with <unk> of lines written on it , which Edmond read as follows : “ ... <unk> invited to dine by his <unk> ... content with making me pay for my hat , ... <unk> for me the fate of <unk> <unk> ... I declare to my nephew , <unk> Spada ... <unk> in a place he knows ... the <unk> of the small ... <unk> of <unk> , gold , money , ... know of the existence of this treasure , which ... <unk> of Roman crowns , and which he ... <unk> from the small ... <unk> have been made ... <unk> in the second ; ... <unk> to him ... <unk> <unk> Spada . ” Faria followed him with an excited look .
“ And now , ” he said , when he saw that Dantès had read the last line , “ put the two <unk> together , and judge for yourself . ” Dantès obeyed , and the <unk> pieces gave the following : <unk> “ This <unk> day of April , <unk> , be ... <unk> invited to dine by his <unk> Alexander <unk> . , and fearing that not ... content with making me pay for my hat , he may desire to become my heir , and re ... <unk> for me the fate of <unk> <unk> and <unk> , who were <unk> , ... I declare to my nephew , <unk> Spada , my sole heir , that I have <unk> ... <unk> in a place he knows and has visited with me , that is , in ... the <unk> of the small Island of Monte Cristo , all I <unk> ... <unk> of <unk> , gold , money , jewels , diamonds , <unk> ; that I alone ... know of the existence of this treasure , which may amount to nearly two <unk> ... <unk> of Roman crowns , and which he will find on raising the <unk> <unk> ... <unk> from the small <unk> to the <unk> in a right line .
Two open ... <unk> have been made in these <unk> ; the treasure is in the <unk> a ... <unk> in the second ; which treasure I <unk> and leave en ... <unk> to him as my sole heir .
“ <unk> April , <unk> .
“ <unk> ... <unk> <unk> Spada . ” “ Well , do you comprehend now ? ” inquired Faria .
“ It is the declaration of Cardinal Spada , and the will so long sought for , ” replied Edmond , still <unk> .
“ Yes ; a thousand times , yes ! ” “ And who completed it as it now is ? ” “ I did .
<unk> by the remaining fragment , I guessed the rest ; <unk> the length of the lines by those of the paper , and <unk> the hidden meaning by means of what was in part revealed , as we are guided in a cavern by the small ray of light above us . ” “ And what did you do when you arrived at this conclusion ? ” “ I resolved to set out , and did set out at that very instant , carrying with me the beginning of my great work , the <unk> of the Italian <unk> ; but for some time the <unk> police ( who at this period , quite contrary to what Napoleon desired so soon as he had a son born to him , wished for a <unk> of <unk> ) had their eyes on me ; and my hasty departure , the cause of which they were unable to guess , having aroused their suspicions , I was arrested at the very moment I was leaving <unk> .
“ Now , ” continued Faria , addressing Dantès with an almost paternal expression , “ now , my dear fellow , you know as much as I do myself .
If we ever escape together , half this treasure is yours ; if I die here , and you escape alone , the whole belongs to you . ” “ But , ” inquired Dantès <unk> , “ has this treasure no more <unk> <unk> in the world than ourselves ? ” “ No , no , be easy on that <unk> ; the family is <unk> .
The last Count of Spada , moreover , made me his heir , <unk> to me this <unk> <unk> , he <unk> to me all it contained ; no , no , make your mind satisfied on that point .
If we lay hands on this fortune , we may enjoy it without remorse . ” “ And you say this treasure <unk> to — — ” “ Two millions of Roman crowns ; nearly <unk> millions of our money . ” 2 “ Impossible ! ” said Dantès , <unk> at the enormous amount .
“ Impossible ?
and why ? ” asked the old man .
“ The Spada family was one of the <unk> and most powerful families of the <unk> century ; and in those times , when other <unk> for <unk> were wanting , such <unk> of gold and jewels were by no means rare ; there are at this day Roman families <unk> of hunger , though possessed of nearly a million in diamonds and jewels , handed down by <unk> , and which they cannot touch . ” Edmond thought he was in a dream — he <unk> between <unk> and joy .
“ I have only kept this secret so long from you , ” continued Faria , “ that I might <unk> your character , and then surprise you .
Had we escaped before my attack of <unk> , I should have conducted you to Monte Cristo ; now , ” he added , with a sigh , “ it is you who will conduct me thither .
Well , Dantès , you do not thank me ? ” “ This treasure belongs to you , my dear friend , ” replied Dantès , “ and to you only .
I have no right to it .
I am no relation of yours . ” “ You are my son , Dantès , ” exclaimed the old man .
“ You are the child of my <unk> .
My profession <unk> me to <unk> .
God has sent you to me to console , at one and the same time , the man who could not be a father , and the prisoner who could not get free . ” And Faria extended the arm of which alone the use remained to him to the young man , who threw himself upon his neck and wept .
Chapter <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> Now that this treasure , which had so long been the object of the abbé ’ s <unk> , could <unk> the future happiness of him whom Faria really loved as a son , it had <unk> its value in his eyes , and every day he <unk> on the amount , <unk> to Dantès all the good which , with <unk> or fourteen millions of francs , a man could do in these days to his friends ; and then Dantès ’ countenance became gloomy , for the oath of vengeance he had taken recurred to his memory , and he reflected how much ill , in these times , a man with <unk> or fourteen millions could do to his enemies .
The abbé did not know the Island of Monte Cristo ; but Dantès knew it , and had often passed it , situated twenty-five miles from <unk> , between Corsica and the Island of Elba , and had once touched there .
This island was , always had been , and still is , completely deserted .
It is a rock of almost <unk> form , which looks as though it had been thrust up by <unk> force from the depth to the surface of the ocean .
Dantès drew a plan of the island for Faria , and Faria gave Dantès advice as to the means he should <unk> to recover the treasure .
But Dantès was far from being as enthusiastic and <unk> as the old man .
It was past a question now that Faria was not a <unk> , and the way in which he had <unk> the discovery , which had given rise to the suspicion of his madness , increased Edmond ’ s admiration of him ; but at the same time Dantès could not believe that the <unk> , supposing it had ever existed , still existed ; and though he considered the treasure as by no means <unk> , he yet believed it was no longer there .
However , as if fate resolved on <unk> the prisoners of their last chance , and making them understand that they were condemned to <unk> <unk> , a new misfortune <unk> them ; the gallery on the sea side , which had long been in ruins , was <unk> .
They had <unk> it completely , and stopped up with vast masses of stone the hole Dantès had partly filled in .
But for this precaution , which , it will be remembered , the abbé had made to Edmond , the misfortune would have been still greater , for their attempt to escape would have been <unk> , and they would undoubtedly have been separated .
Thus a new , a stronger , and more <unk> barrier was <unk> to cut off the <unk> of their hopes .
“ You see , ” said the young man , with an air of sorrowful resignation , to Faria , “ that God <unk> it right to take from me any claim to merit for what you call my devotion to you .
I have promised to remain forever with you , and now I could not break my promise if I would .
The treasure will be no more mine than yours , and neither of us will quit this prison .
But my real treasure is not that , my dear friend , which <unk> me beneath the sombre rocks of Monte Cristo , it is your presence , our living together five or six hours a day , in spite of our <unk> ; it is the rays of intelligence you have <unk> from my brain , the <unk> you have <unk> in my memory , and which have taken <unk> there with all their <unk> <unk> .
These different <unk> that you have made so easy to me by the depth of the knowledge you possess of them , and the <unk> of the principles to which you have reduced them — this is my treasure , my beloved friend , and with this you have made me rich and happy .
Believe me , and take comfort , this is better for me than <unk> of gold and cases of diamonds , even were they not as <unk> as the clouds we see in the morning floating over the sea , which we take for _ <unk> <unk> _ , and which <unk> and vanish as we draw near to them .
To have you as long as possible near me , to hear your <unk> speech , — which <unk> my mind , <unk> my soul , and makes my whole frame capable of great and terrible things , if I should ever be free , — so <unk> my whole existence , that the despair to which I was just on the point of <unk> when I knew you , has no longer any hold over me ; and this — this is my fortune — not <unk> , but actual .
I owe you my real good , my present happiness ; and all the <unk> of the earth , even Cæsar <unk> himself , could not <unk> me of this . ” Thus , if not actually happy , yet the days these two <unk> passed together went quickly .
Faria , who for so long a time had kept silence as to the treasure , now <unk> talked of it .
As he had <unk> would be the case , he remained <unk> in the right arm and the left leg , and had given up all hope of ever <unk> it himself .
But he was continually thinking over some means of escape for his young companion , and <unk> the pleasure he would enjoy .
For fear the letter might be some day lost or stolen , he compelled Dantès to learn it by heart ; and Dantès knew it from the first to the last word .
Then he destroyed the second portion , assured that if the first were seized , no one would be able to discover its real meaning .
<unk> hours sometimes passed while Faria was giving instructions to Dantès , — instructions which were to serve him when he was at liberty .
Then , once free , from the day and hour and moment when he was so , he could have but one only thought , which was , to gain Monte Cristo by some means , and remain there alone under some pretext which would <unk> no suspicions ; and once there , to endeavor to find the wonderful <unk> , and search in the appointed spot , — the appointed spot , be it remembered , being the <unk> angle in the second opening .
In the meanwhile the hours passed , if not rapidly , at least tolerably .
Faria , as we have said , without having recovered the use of his hand and foot , had regained all the <unk> of his understanding , and had gradually , besides the moral instructions we have <unk> , taught his youthful companion the patient and sublime duty of a prisoner , who <unk> to make something from nothing .
They were thus <unk> employed , — Faria , that he might not see himself grow old ; Dantès , for fear of <unk> the almost <unk> past which now only <unk> in his memory like a distant light wandering in the night .
So life went on for them as it does for those who are not <unk> of misfortune and whose <unk> <unk> along mechanically and <unk> beneath the eye of Providence .
But beneath this <unk> calm there were in the heart of the young man , and perhaps in that of the old man , many <unk> desires , many stifled <unk> , which found vent when Faria was left alone , and when Edmond returned to his cell .
One night Edmond awoke suddenly , believing that he heard someone calling him .
He opened his eyes upon utter darkness .
His name , or rather a <unk> voice which <unk> to pronounce his name , reached him .
He sat up in bed and a cold <unk> broke out upon his brow .
<unk> the call came from Faria ’ s dungeon .
“ Alas , ” murmured Edmond ; “ can it be ? ” He moved his bed , drew up the stone , rushed into the passage , and reached the opposite extremity ; the secret entrance was open .
By the light of the wretched and <unk> lamp , of which we have spoken , Dantès saw the old man , pale , but yet erect , <unk> to the <unk> .
His features were <unk> with those horrible symptoms which he already knew , and which had so seriously alarmed him when he saw them for the first time .
“ Alas , my dear friend , ” said Faria in a resigned tone , “ you understand , do you not , and I need not attempt to explain to you ? ” Edmond uttered a cry of agony , and , quite out of his senses , rushed towards the door , <unk> , “ <unk> , help ! ” Faria had just sufficient strength to restrain him .
“ Silence , ” he said , “ or you are lost .
We must now only think of you , my dear friend , and so act as to render your <unk> <unk> or your flight possible .
It would require years to do again what I have done here , and the results would be instantly destroyed if our <unk> knew we had communicated with each other .
Besides , be assured , my dear Edmond , the dungeon I am about to leave will not long remain empty ; some other unfortunate being will soon take my place , and to him you will appear like an angel of <unk> .
Perhaps he will be young , strong , and <unk> , like yourself , and will aid you in your escape , while I have been but a <unk> .
You will no longer have half a dead body tied to you as a drag to all your movements .
At length Providence has done something for you ; he <unk> to you more than he takes away , and it was time I should die . ” Edmond could only <unk> his hands and <unk> , “ Oh , my friend , my friend , speak not thus ! ” and then <unk> all his presence of mind , which had for a moment <unk> under this blow , and his strength , which had failed at the words of the old man , he said , “ Oh , I have saved you once , and I will save you a second time ! ” And raising the foot of the bed , he drew out the <unk> , still a third filled with the red <unk> .
“ See , ” he exclaimed , “ there remains still some of the <unk> draught .
<unk> , quick !
tell me what I must do this time ; are there any fresh instructions ?
Speak , my friend ; I listen . ” “ There is not a hope , ” replied Faria , shaking his head , “ but no matter ; God <unk> it that man whom he has created , and in whose heart he has so profoundly <unk> the love of life , should do all in his power to preserve that existence , which , however painful it may be , is yet always so dear . ” “ Oh , yes , yes ! ” exclaimed Dantès ; “ and I tell you that I will save you yet . ” “ Well , then , try .
The cold <unk> upon me .
I feel the blood <unk> towards my brain .
These horrible <unk> , which make my teeth <unk> and seem to <unk> my bones , begin to <unk> my whole frame ; in five minutes the malady will reach its height , and in a quarter of an hour there will be nothing left of me but a corpse . ” “ Oh ! ” exclaimed Dantès , his heart <unk> with anguish .
“ Do as you did before , only do not wait so long , all the <unk> of life are now exhausted in me , and death , ” he continued , looking at his <unk> arm and leg , “ has but half its work to do .
If , after having made me <unk> twelve drops instead of ten , you see that I do not recover , then <unk> the rest down my throat .
Now lift me on my bed , for I can no longer support myself . ” Edmond took the old man in his arms , and laid him on the bed .
“ And now , my dear friend , ” said Faria , “ sole consolation of my wretched existence , — you whom Heaven gave me somewhat late , but still gave me , a <unk> gift , and for which I am most grateful , — at the moment of <unk> from you forever , I wish you all the happiness and all the prosperity you so well deserve .
My son , I bless thee ! ” The young man cast himself on his knees , leaning his head against the old man ’ s bed .
“ Listen , now , to what I say in this my dying moment .
The treasure of the <unk> exists .
God <unk> me the <unk> of vision <unk> by time or space .
I see it in the depths of the inner cavern .
My eyes <unk> the <unk> <unk> of the earth , and are dazzled at the sight of so much riches .
If you do escape , remember that the poor abbé , whom all the world called mad , was not so .
<unk> to Monte Cristo — <unk> yourself of the fortune — for you have indeed suffered long enough . ” A violent <unk> attacked the old man .
Dantès raised his head and saw Faria ’ s eyes <unk> with blood .
It seemed as if a flow of blood had ascended from the chest to the head .
“ Adieu , adieu ! ” murmured the old man , <unk> Edmond ’ s hand convulsively — “ adieu ! ” “ Oh , no , — no , not yet , ” he cried ; “ do not <unk> me !
Oh , <unk> him !
<unk> — help — help ! ” “ Hush !
<unk> ! ” murmured the dying man , “ that they may not separate us if you save me ! ” “ You are right .
Oh , yes , yes ; be assured I shall save you !
Besides , although you suffer much , you do not seem to be in such agony as you were before . ” “ Do not mistake !
I suffer less because there is in me less strength to endure .
At your age we have faith in life ; it is the privilege of youth to believe and hope , but old men see death more clearly .
Oh , ’ <unk> here — ’ <unk> here — ’ <unk> over — my sight is gone — my senses fail !
Your hand , Dantès !
Adieu !
adieu ! ” And raising himself by a final effort , in which he summoned all his <unk> , he said , — “ Monte Cristo , forget not Monte Cristo ! ” And he fell back on the bed .
The crisis was terrible , and a <unk> form with <unk> limbs , <unk> eyelids , and lips <unk> with <unk> <unk> , lay on the bed of torture , in place of the intellectual being who so lately rested there .
Dantès took the lamp , placed it on a <unk> stone above the bed , whence its <unk> light fell with strange and fantastic ray on the <unk> countenance and motionless , <unk> body .
With steady gaze he awaited <unk> the moment for <unk> the <unk> .
When he believed that the right moment had arrived , he took the knife , <unk> open the teeth , which offered less resistance than before , counted one after the other twelve drops , and watched ; the <unk> contained , perhaps , twice as much more .
He waited ten minutes , a quarter of an hour , half an hour , — no change took place .
<unk> , his hair erect , his brow bathed with perspiration , he counted the seconds by the beating of his heart .
Then he thought it was time to make the last trial , and he put the <unk> to the purple lips of Faria , and without having occasion to force open his <unk> , which had remained extended , he poured the whole of the <unk> down his throat .
<unk> The draught produced a <unk> effect , a violent trembling <unk> the old man ’ s limbs , his eyes opened until it was fearful to gaze upon them , he <unk> a sigh which resembled a <unk> , and then his <unk> body returned gradually to its former <unk> , the eyes remaining open .
Half an hour , an hour , an hour and a half elapsed , and during this period of anguish , Edmond leaned over his friend , his hand applied to his heart , and felt the body gradually grow cold , and the heart ’ s <unk> become more and more deep and dull , until at length it stopped ; the last movement of the heart ceased , the face became livid , the eyes remained open , but the <unk> were <unk> .
It was six o ’ clock in the morning , the dawn was just breaking , and its feeble ray came into the dungeon , and <unk> the <unk> light of the lamp .
<unk> shadows passed over the countenance of the dead man , and at times gave it the appearance of life .
While the struggle between day and night lasted , Dantès still doubted ; but as soon as the daylight gained the <unk> , he saw that he was alone with a corpse .
Then an <unk> and extreme terror seized upon him , and he dared not again press the hand that hung out of bed , he dared no longer to gaze on those fixed and <unk> eyes , which he tried many times to close , but in vain — they opened again as soon as shut .
He extinguished the lamp , carefully concealed it , and then went away , closing as well as he could the entrance to the secret passage by the large stone as he descended .
It was time , for the jailer was coming .
On this occasion he began his <unk> at Dantès ’ cell , and on leaving him he went on to Faria ’ s dungeon , taking thither breakfast and some linen .
Nothing <unk> that the man knew anything of what had occurred .
He went on his way .
Dantès was then seized with an indescribable desire to know what was going on in the dungeon of his unfortunate friend .
He therefore returned by the <unk> gallery , and arrived in time to hear the <unk> of the turnkey , who called out for help .
<unk> <unk> came , and then was heard the regular <unk> of soldiers .
Last of all came the governor .
Edmond heard the <unk> of the bed as they moved the corpse , heard the voice of the governor , who asked them to throw water on the dead man ’ s face ; and seeing that , in spite of this application , the prisoner did not recover , they sent for the doctor .
The governor then went out , and words of pity fell on Dantès ’ listening ears , mingled with brutal laughter .
“ Well , well , ” said one , “ the madman has gone to look after his treasure .
Good journey to him ! ” “ With all his millions , he will not have enough to pay for his <unk> ! ” said another .
“ Oh , ” added a third voice , “ the <unk> of the Château d ’ If are not dear ! ” <unk> “ Perhaps , ” said one of the previous <unk> , “ as he was a <unk> , they may go to some expense in his <unk> . ” “ They may give him the <unk> of the <unk> . ” Edmond did not lose a word , but comprehended very little of what was said .
The voices soon ceased , and it seemed to him as if everyone had left the cell .
Still he dared not to enter , as they might have left some turnkey to watch the dead .
He remained , therefore , mute and motionless , hardly <unk> to breathe .
At the end of an hour , he heard a faint noise , which increased .
It was the governor who returned , followed by the doctor and other attendants .
There was a moment ’ s silence , — it was evident that the doctor was examining the dead body .
The inquiries soon <unk> .
The doctor <unk> the symptoms of the malady to which the prisoner had <unk> , and declared that he was dead .
<unk> and <unk> followed in a <unk> manner that made Dantès <unk> , for he felt that all the world should have for the poor abbé a love and respect equal to his own .
“ I am very sorry for what you tell me , ” said the governor , replying to the assurance of the doctor , “ that the old man is really dead ; for he was a quiet , <unk> prisoner , happy in his folly , and required no watching . ” “ Ah , ” added the turnkey , “ there was no occasion for watching him ; he would have <unk> here fifty years , I ’ ll answer for it , without any attempt to escape . ” “ Still , ” said the governor , “ I believe it will be requisite , notwithstanding your certainty , and not that I doubt your science , but in discharge of my official duty , that we should be perfectly assured that the prisoner is dead . ” There was a moment of complete silence , during which Dantès , still listening , knew that the doctor was examining the corpse a second time .
“ You may make your mind easy , ” said the doctor ; “ he is dead .
I will answer for that . ” “ You know , sir , ” said the governor , <unk> , “ that we are not content in such cases as this with such a simple examination .
In spite of all appearances , be so kind , therefore , as to finish your duty by <unk> the <unk> described by law . ” “ Let the <unk> be <unk> , ” said the doctor ; “ but really it is a useless precaution . ” This order to heat the <unk> made Dantès shudder .
He heard hasty steps , the <unk> of a door , people going and coming , and some minutes afterwards a turnkey entered , saying : “ Here is the brazier , lighted . ” There was a moment ’ s silence , and then was heard the <unk> of burning flesh , of which the peculiar and <unk> smell penetrated even behind the wall where Dantès was listening in horror .
The perspiration poured forth upon the young man ’ s brow , and he felt as if he should faint .
“ You see , sir , he is really dead , ” said the doctor ; “ this burn in the <unk> is decisive .
The poor fool is <unk> of his folly , and delivered from his <unk> . ” “ <unk> ’ t his name Faria ? ” inquired one of the officers who accompanied the governor .
<unk> “ Yes , sir ; and , as he said , it was an ancient name .
He was , too , very learned , and rational enough on all points which did not relate to his treasure ; but on that , indeed , he was <unk> . ” “ It is the sort of malady which we call <unk> , ” said the doctor .
“ You had never anything to complain of ? ” said the governor to the jailer who had charge of the abbé .
“ Never , sir , ” replied the jailer , “ never ; on the contrary , he sometimes amused me very much by telling me stories .
One day , too , when my wife was ill , he gave me a <unk> which <unk> her . ” “ Ah , <unk> ! ” said the doctor , “ I did not know that I had a <unk> ; but I hope , governor , that you will show him all proper respect in consequence . ” “ Yes , yes , make your mind easy , he shall be <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> we can find .
Will that satisfy you ? ” “ <unk> this last <unk> take place in your presence , sir ? ” inquired a turnkey .
“ Certainly .
But make haste — I cannot stay here all day . ” <unk> footsteps , going and coming , were now heard , and a moment afterwards the noise of <unk> canvas reached Dantès ’ ears , the bed <unk> , and the heavy <unk> of a man who <unk> a weight sounded on the floor ; then the bed again <unk> under the weight deposited upon it .
“ This evening , ” said the governor .
“ Will there be any mass ? ” asked one of the attendants .
“ That is impossible , ” replied the governor .
“ The <unk> of the <unk> came to me yesterday to beg for leave of absence , in order to take a trip to <unk> for a week .
I told him I would attend to the prisoners in his absence .
If the poor abbé had not been in such a hurry , he might have had his <unk> . ” “ <unk> , <unk> ; ” said the doctor , with the <unk> usual in persons of his profession ; “ he is a <unk> .
God will respect his profession , and not give the devil the wicked delight of sending him a priest . ” A shout of laughter followed this brutal jest .
Meanwhile the operation of putting the body in the <unk> was going on .
“ This evening , ” said the governor , when the task was ended .
“ At what hour ? ” inquired a turnkey .
“ Why , about ten or eleven o ’ clock . ” “ Shall we watch by the corpse ? ” “ Of what use would it be ?
<unk> the dungeon as if he were alive — that is all . ” Then the steps retreated , and the voices died away in the distance ; the noise of the door , with its <unk> hinges and bolts ceased , and a silence more sombre than that of solitude ensued , — the silence of death , which was <unk> , and struck its <unk> chill to the very soul of Dantès .
Then he raised the <unk> <unk> with his head , and looked carefully around the chamber .
It was empty , and Dantès emerged from the <unk> .
Chapter <unk> .
The <unk> of the Château d ’ If On the bed , at full length , and <unk> illuminated by the pale light that came from the window , lay a <unk> of canvas , and under its rude folds was stretched a long and <unk> form ; it was Faria ’ s last <unk> , — a <unk> which , as the turnkey said , cost so little .
Everything was in readiness .
A barrier had been placed between Dantès and his old friend .
No longer could Edmond look into those <unk> eyes which had seemed to be penetrating the mysteries of death ; no longer could he <unk> the hand which had done so much to make his existence blessed .
Faria , the <unk> and cheerful companion , with whom he was accustomed to live so <unk> , no longer breathed .
He seated himself on the edge of that terrible bed , and fell into melancholy and gloomy reverie .
<unk> !
he was alone again !
again condemned to silence — again face to face with <unk> !
<unk> ! — never again to see the face , never again to hear the voice of the only human being who united him to earth !
Was not Faria ’ s fate the better , after all — to <unk> the problem of life at its source , even at the risk of horrible suffering ?
The idea of suicide , which his friend had driven away and kept away by his cheerful presence , now <unk> like a phantom over the abbé ’ s dead body .
“ If I could die , ” he said , “ I should go where he goes , and should assuredly find him again .
But how to die ?
It is very easy , ” he went on with a smile ; “ I will remain here , rush on the first person that opens the door , <unk> him , and then they will <unk> me . ” But excessive grief is like a storm at sea , where the <unk> <unk> is tossed from the depths to the top of the wave .
Dantès recoiled from the idea of so infamous a death , and passed suddenly from despair to an ardent desire for life and liberty .
“ <unk> ?
oh , no , ” he exclaimed — “ not die now , after having lived and suffered so long and so much !
<unk> ?
yes , had I died years ago ; but now to die would be , indeed , to give way to the <unk> of destiny .
No , I want to live ; I shall struggle to the very last ; I will yet <unk> back the happiness of which I have been deprived .
Before I die I must not forget that I have my <unk> to <unk> , and perhaps , too , who knows , some friends to <unk> .
Yet they will forget me here , and I shall die in my dungeon like Faria . ” As he said this , he became silent and gazed straight before him like one overwhelmed with a strange and <unk> thought .
Suddenly he arose , lifted his hand to his brow as if his brain were <unk> , <unk> twice or <unk> round the dungeon , and then paused abruptly by the bed .
“ Just God ! ” he muttered , “ whence comes this thought ?
Is it from thee ?
Since none but the dead pass freely from this dungeon , let me take the place of the dead ! ” Without giving himself time to <unk> his decision , and , indeed , that he might not allow his thoughts to be <unk> from his desperate resolution , he bent over the <unk> <unk> , opened it with the knife which Faria had made , drew the corpse from the <unk> , and bore it along the <unk> to his own chamber , laid it on his <unk> , tied around its head the <unk> he wore at night around his own , covered it with his <unk> , once again kissed the <unk> brow , and tried <unk> to close the <unk> eyes , which <unk> horribly , turned the head towards the wall , so that the jailer might , when he brought the evening <unk> , believe that he was asleep , as was his frequent custom ; entered the <unk> again , drew the bed against the wall , returned to the other cell , took from the <unk> the <unk> and thread , flung off his rags , that they might feel only naked flesh beneath the coarse canvas , and getting inside the <unk> , placed himself in the <unk> in which the dead body had been laid , and <unk> up the mouth of the <unk> from the inside .
He would have been discovered by the beating of his heart , if by any <unk> the <unk> had entered at that moment .
Dantès might have waited until the evening visit was over , but he was afraid that the governor would change his mind , and order the dead body to be removed earlier .
In that case his last hope would have been destroyed .
Now his plans were fully made , and this is what he intended to do .
If while he was being carried out the <unk> should discover that they were bearing a live instead of a dead body , Dantès did not intend to give them time to recognize him , but with a sudden cut of the knife , he meant to open the <unk> from top to bottom , and , <unk> by their alarm , escape ; if they tried to catch him , he would use his knife to better purpose .
<unk> If they took him to the cemetery and laid him in a grave , he would allow himself to be covered with earth , and then , as it was night , the <unk> could scarcely have turned their <unk> before he would have worked his way through the <unk> soil and escaped .
He hoped that the weight of earth would not be so great that he could not overcome it .
If he was <unk> in this and the earth proved too heavy , he would be stifled , and then — so much the better , all would be over .
Dantès had not eaten since the preceding evening , but he had not thought of hunger , nor did he think of it now .
His situation was too <unk> to allow him even time to reflect on any thought but one .
The first risk that Dantès ran was , that the jailer , when he brought him his supper at seven o ’ clock , might perceive the change that had been made ; fortunately , twenty times at least , from <unk> or fatigue , Dantès had received his jailer in bed , and then the man placed his bread and <unk> on the table , and went away without saying a word .
This time the jailer might not be as silent as usual , but speak to Dantès , and seeing that he received no reply , go to the bed , and thus discover all .
When seven o ’ clock came , Dantès ’ agony really began .
His hand placed upon his heart was unable to <unk> its <unk> , while , with the other he wiped the perspiration from his <unk> .
From time to time <unk> ran through his whole body , and <unk> his heart in a grasp of ice .
Then he thought he was going to die .
Yet the hours passed on without any unusual <unk> , and Dantès knew that he had escaped the first peril .
It was a good <unk> .
At length , about the hour the governor had appointed , footsteps were heard on the stairs .
Edmond felt that the moment had arrived , summoned up all his courage , held his breath , and would have been happy if at the same time he could have <unk> the <unk> of his veins .
The footsteps — they were double — paused at the door — and Dantès guessed that the two <unk> had come to seek him — this idea was soon converted into certainty , when he heard the noise they made in putting down the <unk> .
The door opened , and a dim light reached Dantès ’ eyes through the coarse <unk> that covered him ; he saw two shadows approach his bed , a third remaining at the door with a torch in its hand .
The two men , approaching the ends of the bed , took the <unk> by its <unk> .
“ He ’ s heavy , though , for an old and thin man , ” said one , as he raised the head .
“ They say every year <unk> half a <unk> to the weight of the bones , ” said another , <unk> the feet .
“ Have you tied the <unk> ? ” inquired the first <unk> .
“ What would be the use of carrying so much more weight ? ” was the reply , “ I can do that when we get there . ” “ Yes , you ’ re right , ” replied the companion .
“ What ’ s the <unk> for ? ” thought Dantès .
They deposited the supposed corpse on the <unk> .
Edmond <unk> himself in order to play the part of a dead man , and then the party , lighted by the man with the torch , who went first , ascended the stairs .
Suddenly he felt the fresh and sharp night air , and Dantès knew that the <unk> was blowing .
It was a sensation in which pleasure and pain were strangely mingled .
The <unk> went on for twenty paces , then stopped , putting the <unk> down on the ground .
One of them went away , and Dantès heard his shoes striking on the pavement .
“ Where am I ? ” he asked himself .
“ Really , he is by no means a light <unk> ! ” said the other <unk> , sitting on the edge of the <unk> .
Dantès ’ first impulse was to escape , but fortunately he did not attempt it .
“ Give us a light , ” said the other <unk> , “ or I shall never find what I am looking for . ” The man with the torch <unk> , although not asked in the most <unk> terms .
“ What can he be looking for ? ” thought Edmond .
“ The <unk> , perhaps . ” An exclamation of satisfaction indicated that the grave-digger had found the object of his search .
“ Here it is at last , ” he said , “ not without some trouble , though . ” “ Yes , ” was the answer , “ but it has lost nothing by waiting . ” As he said this , the man came towards Edmond , who heard a heavy <unk> substance laid down beside him , and at the same moment a <unk> was fastened round his feet with sudden and painful violence .
“ Well , have you tied the <unk> ? ” inquired the grave-digger , who was looking on .
“ Yes , and pretty <unk> too , I can tell you , ” was the answer .
“ <unk> on , then . ” And the <unk> was lifted once more , and they proceeded .
They advanced fifty paces farther , and then stopped to open a door , then went forward again .
The noise of the waves <unk> against the rocks on which the <unk> is built , reached Dantès ’ ear distinctly as they went forward .
“ <unk> weather ! ” observed one of the <unk> ; “ not a pleasant night for a <unk> in the sea . ” “ Why , yes , the abbé runs a chance of being wet , ” said the other ; and then there was a burst of brutal laughter .
Dantès did not comprehend the jest , but his hair stood erect on his head .
“ Well , here we are at last , ” said one of them .
“ A little farther — a little farther , ” said the other .
“ You know very well that the last was stopped on his way , dashed on the rocks , and the governor told us next day that we were <unk> fellows . ” They ascended five or six more steps , and then Dantès felt that they took him , one by the head and the other by the heels , and <unk> him to and fro .
“ One ! ” said the <unk> , “ two !
three ! ” And at the same instant Dantès felt himself flung into the air like a wounded bird , falling , falling , with a rapidity that made his blood <unk> .
Although drawn <unk> by the heavy weight which hastened his rapid descent , it seemed to him as if the fall lasted for a century .
At last , with a horrible <unk> , he darted like an <unk> into the <unk> water , and as he did so he uttered a <unk> cry , stifled in a moment by his <unk> beneath the waves .
Dantès had been flung into the sea , and was dragged into its depths by a <unk> shot tied to his feet .
The sea is the cemetery of the Château d ’ If .
<unk> Chapter <unk> .
The Island of <unk> Dantès , although <unk> and almost <unk> , had sufficient presence of mind to hold his breath , and as his right hand ( prepared as he was for every chance ) held his knife open , he rapidly <unk> up the <unk> , <unk> his arm , and then his body ; but in spite of all his efforts to free himself from the shot , he felt it dragging him down still lower .
He then bent his body , and by a desperate effort <unk> the <unk> that bound his legs , at the moment when it seemed as if he were actually <unk> .
With a mighty <unk> he rose to the surface of the sea , while the shot dragged down to the depths the <unk> that had so nearly become his <unk> .
Dantès waited only to get breath , and then <unk> , in order to avoid being seen .
When he arose a second time , he was fifty paces from where he had first sunk .
He saw <unk> a black and <unk> sky , across which the wind was driving clouds that occasionally suffered a <unk> star to appear ; before him was the vast <unk> of waters , sombre and terrible , whose waves <unk> and <unk> as if before the approach of a storm .
Behind him , <unk> than the sea , <unk> than the sky , rose <unk> the vast stone <unk> , whose <unk> <unk> seemed like arms extended to seize their prey , and on the highest rock was a torch <unk> two figures .
He fancied that these two forms were looking at the sea ; doubtless these strange <unk> had heard his cry .
Dantès <unk> again , and remained a long time beneath the water .
This was an easy <unk> to him , for he usually attracted a crowd of spectators in the <unk> before the <unk> at Marseilles when he <unk> there , and was <unk> declared to be the best <unk> in the port .
When he came up again the light had disappeared .
He must now get his <unk> .
<unk> and <unk> are the nearest <unk> of all those that <unk> the Château d ’ If , but <unk> and <unk> are inhabited , as is also the <unk> of <unk> .
<unk> and <unk> were therefore the <unk> for Dantès ’ venture .
The <unk> of <unk> and <unk> are a league from the Château d ’ If ; Dantès , nevertheless , determined to make for them .
But how could he find his way in the darkness of the night ?
At this moment he saw the light of <unk> , <unk> in front of him like a star .
By leaving this light on the right , he kept the Island of <unk> a little on the left ; by turning to the left , therefore , he would find it .
But , as we have said , it was at least a league from the Château d ’ If to this island .
<unk> in prison Faria had said to him , when he saw him idle and <unk> : “ Dantès , you must not give way to this <unk> ; you will be <unk> if you seek to escape , and your strength has not been properly exercised and prepared for exertion . ” These words rang in Dantès ’ ears , even beneath the waves ; he hastened to <unk> his way through them to see if he had not lost his strength .
He found with pleasure that his <unk> had taken away nothing of his power , and that he was still master of that element on whose bosom he had so often <unk> as a boy .
<unk> , that <unk> <unk> , <unk> Dantès ’ efforts .
He listened for any sound that might be audible , and every time that he rose to the top of a wave he <unk> the horizon , and strove to penetrate the darkness .
He fancied that every wave behind him was a pursuing boat , and he redoubled his <unk> , increasing rapidly his distance from the <unk> , but <unk> his strength .
He <unk> on still , and already the terrible <unk> had disappeared in the darkness .
He could not see it , but he _ felt _ its presence .
An hour passed , during which Dantès , excited by the feeling of freedom , continued to <unk> the waves .
“ Let us see , ” said he , “ I have <unk> above an hour , but as the wind is against me , that has <unk> my speed ; however , if I am not mistaken , I must be close to <unk> .
But what if I were mistaken ? ” A shudder passed over him .
He sought to tread water , in order to rest himself ; but the sea was too violent , and he felt that he could not make use of this means of <unk> .
“ Well , ” said he , “ I will <unk> on until I am worn out , or the <unk> <unk> me , and then I shall sink ; ” and he struck out with the energy of despair .
Suddenly the sky seemed to him to become still <unk> and more <unk> , and heavy clouds seemed to <unk> down towards him ; at the same time he felt a sharp pain in his knee .
He fancied for a moment that he had been shot , and listened for the report ; but he heard nothing .
Then he put out his hand , and encountered an obstacle and with another stroke knew that he had gained the shore .
Before him rose a <unk> mass of rocks , that resembled nothing so much as a vast fire petrified at the moment of its most <unk> <unk> .
It was the Island of <unk> .
Dantès rose , advanced a few steps , and , with a <unk> prayer of gratitude , stretched himself on the granite , which seemed to him <unk> than down .
Then , in spite of the wind and rain , he fell into the deep , sweet sleep of utter <unk> .
At the expiration of an hour Edmond was awakened by the <unk> of thunder .
The tempest was let loose and beating the <unk> with its mighty wings ; from time to time a flash of lightning stretched across the heavens like a <unk> <unk> , <unk> up the clouds that rolled on in vast <unk> waves .
Dantès had not been deceived — he had reached the first of the two <unk> , which was , in fact , <unk> .
He knew that it was <unk> and without shelter ; but when the sea became more calm , he resolved to <unk> into its waves again , and <unk> to <unk> , equally <unk> , but larger , and consequently better <unk> for <unk> .
An <unk> rock offered him a <unk> shelter , and scarcely had he <unk> himself of it when the tempest burst forth in all its fury .
Edmond felt the trembling of the rock beneath which he lay ; the waves , <unk> themselves against it , <unk> him with their <unk> .
He was safely <unk> , and yet he felt <unk> in the midst of the <unk> of the elements and the dazzling <unk> of the lightning .
It seemed to him that the island trembled to its base , and that it would , like a vessel at anchor , break <unk> , and bear him off into the centre of the storm .
He then recollected that he had not eaten or drunk for <unk> hours .
He extended his hands , and drank <unk> of the <unk> that had <unk> in a hollow of the rock .
As he rose , a flash of lightning , that seemed to <unk> the <unk> <unk> of heaven , <unk> the darkness .
By its light , between the Island of <unk> and <unk> <unk> , a quarter of a league distant , Dantès saw a <unk> driven rapidly like a spectre before the power of <unk> and waves .
A second after , he saw it again , approaching with frightful rapidity .
Dantès cried at the top of his voice to warn them of their danger , but they saw it themselves .
Another flash showed him four men <unk> to the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> , while a fifth clung to the broken <unk> .
The men he beheld saw him undoubtedly , for their cries were carried to his ears by the wind .
<unk> the <unk> <unk> a sail rent to <unk> was <unk> ; suddenly the <unk> that still held it gave way , and it disappeared in the darkness of the night like a vast <unk> .
At the same moment a violent <unk> was heard , and cries of distress .
Dantès from his <unk> <unk> saw the <unk> vessel , and among the <unk> the floating forms of the <unk> sailors .
Then all was dark again .
Dantès ran down the rocks at the risk of being himself dashed to pieces ; he listened , he <unk> about , but he heard and saw nothing — the cries had ceased , and the tempest continued to rage .
By degrees the wind <unk> , vast gray clouds rolled towards the <unk> , and the blue <unk> appeared <unk> with bright stars .
Soon a red <unk> became visible in the horizon , the waves <unk> , a light played over them , and gilded their <unk> <unk> with gold .
It was day .
Dantès stood mute and motionless before this <unk> spectacle , as if he now beheld it for the first time ; and indeed since his <unk> in the Château d ’ If he had forgotten that such scenes were ever to be witnessed .
He turned towards the <unk> , and looked at both sea and land .
The gloomy building rose from the bosom of the ocean with <unk> majesty and seemed to <unk> the scene .
It was about five o ’ clock .
The sea continued to get <unk> .
“ In two or three hours , ” thought Dantès , “ the turnkey will enter my chamber , find the body of my poor friend , recognize it , seek for me in vain , and give the alarm .
Then the <unk> will be discovered ; the men who cast me into the sea and who must have heard the cry I uttered , will be questioned .
Then <unk> filled with armed soldiers will pursue the wretched <unk> .
The cannon will warn everyone to refuse shelter to a man wandering about naked and <unk> .
The police of Marseilles will be on the <unk> by land , whilst the governor <unk> me by sea .
I am cold , I am hungry .
I have lost even the knife that saved me .
Oh , my God , I have suffered enough surely !
Have pity on me , and do for me what I am unable to do for myself . ” As Dantès ( his eyes turned in the direction of the Château d ’ If ) uttered this prayer , he saw off the farther point of the Island of <unk> a small vessel with <unk> sail <unk> the sea like a <unk> in search of prey ; and with his sailor ’ s eye he knew it to be a <unk> <unk> .
She was coming out of Marseilles <unk> , and was standing out to sea rapidly , her sharp <unk> <unk> through the waves .
“ Oh , ” cried Edmond , “ to think that in half an hour I could join her , did I not fear being questioned , <unk> , and conveyed back to Marseilles !
What can I do ?
What story can I <unk> ?
under pretext of <unk> along the coast , these men , who are in reality smugglers , will prefer <unk> me to doing a good action .
I must wait .
But I cannot — I am <unk> .
In a few hours my strength will be utterly exhausted ; besides , perhaps I have not been missed at the <unk> .
I can pass as one of the sailors <unk> last night .
My story will be accepted , for there is no one left to <unk> me . ” As he spoke , Dantès looked toward the spot where the <unk> had been <unk> , and started .
The red cap of one of the sailors hung to a point of the rock and some <unk> that had formed part of the vessel ’ s <unk> , <unk> at the foot of the <unk> .
In an instant Dantès ’ plan was formed .
He <unk> to the cap , placed it on his head , seized one of the <unk> , and struck out so as to cut across the course the vessel was taking .
“ I am saved ! ” murmured he .
And this conviction restored his strength .
He soon saw that the vessel , with the wind dead <unk> , was <unk> between the Château d ’ If and the tower of <unk> .
For an instant he feared lest , instead of keeping in shore , she should stand out to sea ; but he soon saw that she would pass , like most <unk> bound for Italy , between the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> .
However , the vessel and the <unk> <unk> <unk> one another , and in one of its <unk> the <unk> bore down within a quarter of a mile of him .
He rose on the waves , making signs of distress ; but no one on board saw him , and the vessel stood on another <unk> .
Dantès would have shouted , but he knew that the wind would <unk> his voice .
It was then he rejoiced at his precaution in taking the <unk> , for without it he would have been unable , perhaps , to reach the vessel — certainly to return to shore , should he be <unk> in <unk> attention .
Dantès , though almost sure as to what course the vessel would take , had yet watched it anxiously until it <unk> and stood towards him .
Then he advanced ; but before they could meet , the vessel again changed her course .
By a violent effort he rose half out of the water , <unk> his cap , and uttering a loud shout peculiar to sailors .
This time he was both seen and heard , and the <unk> instantly <unk> towards him .
At the same time , he saw they were about to lower the boat .
An instant after , the boat , <unk> by two men , advanced rapidly towards him .
Dantès let go of the <unk> , which he now thought to be useless , and <unk> <unk> to meet them .
But he had <unk> too much upon his strength , and then he realized how <unk> the <unk> had been to him .
His arms became stiff , his legs lost their <unk> , and he was almost breathless .
He shouted again .
The two sailors redoubled their efforts , and one of them cried in Italian , “ <unk> ! ” The word reached his ear as a wave which he no longer had the strength to <unk> passed over his head .
He rose again to the surface , struggled with the last desperate effort of a <unk> man , uttered a third cry , and felt himself sinking , as if the fatal cannon shot were again tied to his feet .
The water passed over his head , and the sky turned gray .
A <unk> movement again brought him to the surface .
He felt himself seized by the hair , then he saw and heard nothing .
He had fainted .
When he opened his eyes Dantès found himself on the deck of the <unk> .
His first care was to see what course they were taking .
They were rapidly leaving the Château d ’ If behind .
Dantès was so exhausted that the exclamation of joy he uttered was mistaken for a sigh .
As we have said , he was lying on the deck .
A sailor was <unk> his limbs with a woollen cloth ; another , whom he recognized as the one who had cried out “ <unk> ! ” held a <unk> full of <unk> to his mouth ; while the third , an old sailor , at once the <unk> and captain , looked on with that <unk> pity men feel for a misfortune that they have escaped yesterday , and which may <unk> them tomorrow .
A few drops of the <unk> restored suspended animation , while the <unk> of his limbs restored their <unk> .
“ Who are you ? ” said the <unk> in bad French .
“ I am , ” replied Dantès , in bad Italian , “ a <unk> sailor .
We were coming from <unk> <unk> with <unk> .
The storm of last night <unk> us at <unk> <unk> , and we were <unk> on these rocks . ” “ Where do you come from ? ” “ From these rocks that I had the good luck to <unk> to while our captain and the rest of the crew were all lost .
I saw your vessel , and fearful of being left to <unk> on the <unk> island , I <unk> off on a piece of <unk> to try and <unk> your course .
You have saved my life , and I thank you , ” continued Dantès .
“ I was lost when one of your sailors caught hold of my hair . ” “ It was I , ” said a sailor of a <unk> and <unk> appearance ; “ and it was time , for you were sinking . ” “ Yes , ” returned Dantès , holding out his hand , “ I thank you again . ” “ I almost hesitated , though , ” replied the sailor ; “ you looked more like a <unk> than an honest man , with your beard six inches , and your hair a foot long . ” Dantès recollected that his hair and beard had not been cut all the time he was at the Château d ’ If .
“ Yes , ” said he , “ I made a <unk> , to our Lady of the <unk> not to cut my hair or beard for ten years if I were saved in a moment of danger ; but today the <unk> <unk> . ” “ Now what are we to do with you ? ” said the captain .
“ Alas , anything you please .
My captain is dead ; I have barely escaped ; but I am a good sailor .
Leave me at the first port you make ; I shall be sure to find employment . ” “ Do you know the <unk> ? ” “ I have <unk> over it since my childhood . ” “ You know the best <unk> ? ” “ There are few <unk> that I could not enter or leave with a <unk> over my eyes . ” “ I say , captain , ” said the sailor who had cried “ <unk> ! ” to Dantès , “ if what he says is true , what <unk> his staying with us ? ” “ If he says true , ” said the captain <unk> .
“ But in his present condition he will promise anything , and take his chance of keeping it afterwards . ” “ I will do more than I promise , ” said Dantès .
“ We shall see , ” returned the other , smiling .
“ Where are you going ? ” asked Dantès .
“ To Leghorn . ” “ Then why , instead of <unk> so frequently , do you not sail nearer the wind ? ” “ Because we should run straight on to the Island of <unk> . ” “ You shall pass it by twenty <unk> . ” “ Take the <unk> , and let us see what you know . ” The young man took the <unk> , felt to see if the vessel answered the <unk> <unk> and seeing that , without being a <unk> sailor , she yet was tolerably <unk> .
“ To the sheets , ” said he .
The four <unk> , who composed the crew , obeyed , while the <unk> looked on .
“ <unk> <unk> . ” They obeyed .
“ <unk> . ” This order was also executed ; and the vessel passed , as Dantès had <unk> , twenty <unk> to <unk> .
“ <unk> ! ” said the captain .
“ <unk> ! ” repeated the sailors .
And they all looked with astonishment at this man whose eye now <unk> an intelligence and his body a <unk> they had not thought him capable of showing .
“ You see , ” said Dantès , quitting the <unk> , “ I shall be of some use to you , at least during the voyage .
If you do not want me at Leghorn , you can leave me there , and I will pay you out of the first <unk> I get , for my food and the clothes you lend me . ” “ Ah , ” said the captain , “ we can agree very well , if you are reasonable . ” “ Give me what you give the others , and it will be all right , ” returned Dantès .
“ That ’ s not fair , ” said the <unk> who had saved Dantès ; “ for you know more than we do . ” “ What is that to you , Jacopo ? ” returned the Captain .
“ <unk> is free to ask what he pleases . ” “ That ’ s true , ” replied Jacopo ; “ I only make a remark . ” “ Well , you would do much better to find him a <unk> and a pair of trousers , if you have them . ” “ No , ” said Jacopo ; “ but I have a shirt and a pair of trousers . ” “ That is all I want , ” interrupted Dantès .
Jacopo <unk> into the hold and soon returned with what Edmond wanted .
“ Now , then , do you wish for anything else ? ” said the patron .
“ A piece of bread and another glass of the capital <unk> I <unk> , for I have not eaten or drunk for a long time . ” He had not <unk> food for forty hours .
A piece of bread was brought , and Jacopo offered him the <unk> .
“ <unk> your <unk> , ” cried the captain to the <unk> .
Dantès glanced that way as he lifted the <unk> to his mouth ; then paused with hand in <unk> .
“ <unk> !
what ’ s the matter at the Château d ’ If ? ” said the captain .
A small white cloud , which had attracted Dantès ’ attention , crowned the summit of the <unk> of the Château d ’ If .
At the same moment the faint report of a gun was heard .
The sailors looked at one another .
“ What is this ? ” asked the captain .
“ A prisoner has escaped from the Château d ’ If , and they are firing the alarm gun , ” replied Dantès .
The captain glanced at him , but he had lifted the <unk> to his lips and was drinking it with so much composure , that suspicions , if the captain had any , died away .
<unk> “ <unk> strong <unk> ! ” said Dantès , <unk> his brow with his <unk> .
“ At any rate , ” murmured he , “ if it be , so much the better , for I have made a rare <unk> . ” <unk> Under <unk> of being fatigued , Dantès asked to take the <unk> ; the <unk> , glad to be relieved , looked at the captain , and the latter by a sign indicated that he might abandon it to his new comrade .
Dantès could thus keep his eyes on Marseilles .
“ What is the day of the month ? ” asked he of Jacopo , who sat down beside him .
“ The <unk> of February . ” “ In what year ? ” “ In what year — you ask me in what year ? ” “ Yes , ” replied the young man , “ I ask you in what year ! ” “ You have forgotten then ? ” “ I got such a fright last night , ” replied Dantès , smiling , “ that I have almost lost my memory .
I ask you what year is it ? ” “ The year <unk> , ” returned Jacopo .
It was fourteen years , day for day , since Dantès ’ arrest .
He was nineteen when he entered the Château d ’ If ; he was <unk> when he escaped .
A sorrowful smile passed over his face ; he asked himself what had become of Mercédès , who must believe him dead .
Then his eyes lighted up with hatred as he thought of the three men who had caused him so long and wretched a <unk> .
He renewed against Danglars , Fernand , and Villefort the oath of <unk> vengeance he had made in his dungeon .
This oath was no longer a vain <unk> ; for the <unk> sailor in the <unk> would have been unable to <unk> the little <unk> , that with every <unk> of canvas set was flying before the wind to Leghorn .
Chapter <unk> .
The <unk> Dantès had not been a day on board before he had a very clear idea of the men with whom his lot had been cast .
Without having been in the school of the Abbé Faria , the worthy master of _ La <unk> <unk> _ ( the name of the <unk> <unk> ) knew a <unk> of all the <unk> spoken on the <unk> of that large lake called the <unk> , from the <unk> to the <unk> , and this , while it spared him <unk> , persons always troublesome and frequently <unk> , gave him great <unk> of communication , either with the <unk> he met at sea , with the small <unk> <unk> along the coast , or with the people without name , country , or occupation , who are always seen on the <unk> of <unk> , and who live by hidden and mysterious means which we must suppose to be a direct gift of Providence , as they have no visible means of support .
It is fair to assume that Dantès was on board a <unk> .
At first the captain had received Dantès on board with a certain degree of distrust .
He was very well known to the customs officers of the coast ; and as there was between these <unk> and himself a <unk> battle of <unk> , he had at first thought that Dantès might be an <unk> of these <unk> <unk> of rights and duties , who perhaps employed this ingenious means of <unk> some of the secrets of his trade .
But the skilful manner in which Dantès had <unk> the <unk> had entirely reassured him ; and then , when he saw the light <unk> of smoke floating above the <unk> of the Château d ’ If , and heard the distant report , he was instantly struck with the idea that he had on board his vessel one whose coming and going , like that of kings , was accompanied with <unk> of artillery .
This made him less uneasy , it must be owned , than if the <unk> had proved to be a customs officer ; but this <unk> also disappeared like the first , when he beheld the perfect tranquillity of his <unk> .
Edmond thus had the advantage of knowing what the owner was , without the owner knowing who he was ; and however the old sailor and his crew tried to “ <unk> ” him , they <unk> nothing more from him ; he gave <unk> <unk> of Naples and <unk> , which he knew as well as Marseilles , and held <unk> to his first story .
Thus the <unk> , <unk> as he was , was <unk> by Edmond , in whose favor his <unk> <unk> , his <unk> skill , and his admirable <unk> , <unk> .
Moreover , it is possible that the <unk> was one of those <unk> persons who know nothing but what they should know , and believe nothing but what they should believe .
In this state of mutual understanding , they reached Leghorn .
Here Edmond was to <unk> another trial ; he was to find out whether he could recognize himself , as he had not seen his own face for fourteen years .
He had preserved a tolerably good remembrance of what the youth had been , and was now to find out what the man had become .
His comrades believed that his <unk> was <unk> .
As he had twenty times touched at Leghorn , he remembered a <unk> in St. <unk> Street ; he went there to have his beard and hair cut .
The <unk> gazed in amazement at this man with the long , thick and black hair and beard , which gave his head the appearance of one of <unk> ’ s <unk> .
At this period it was not the fashion to wear so large a beard and hair so long ; now a <unk> would only be surprised if a man <unk> with such advantages should consent <unk> to <unk> himself of them .
The Leghorn <unk> said nothing and went to work .
When the operation was concluded , and Edmond felt that his chin was completely smooth , and his hair reduced to its usual length , he asked for a <unk> .
He was now , as we have said , <unk> years of age , and his fourteen years ’ <unk> had produced a great <unk> in his appearance .
Dantès had entered the Château d ’ If with the round , open , smiling face of a young and happy man , with whom the early paths of life have been smooth , and who <unk> a future <unk> with his past .
This was now all changed .
The <unk> face was <unk> , his smiling mouth had assumed the firm and marked lines which <unk> resolution ; his eyebrows were <unk> beneath a brow <unk> with thought ; his eyes were full of melancholy , and from their depths occasionally <unk> gloomy <unk> of <unk> and hatred ; his complexion , so long kept from the sun , had now that pale color which produces , when the features are <unk> with black hair , the <unk> beauty of the man of the north ; the profound <unk> he had acquired had besides <unk> over his features a <unk> intellectual expression ; and he had also acquired , being naturally of a <unk> stature , that <unk> which a frame possesses which has so long <unk> all its force within itself .
<unk> To the elegance of a nervous and slight form had succeeded the <unk> of a <unk> and <unk> figure .
As to his voice , prayers , sobs , and <unk> had changed it so that at times it was of a <unk> penetrating sweetness , and at others rough and almost hoarse .
Moreover , from being so long in twilight or darkness , his eyes had acquired the <unk> of <unk> objects in the night , common to the <unk> and the wolf .
Edmond smiled when he beheld himself ; it was impossible that his best friend — if , indeed , he had any friend left — could recognize him ; he could not recognize himself .
The master of _ La <unk> <unk> _ , who was very desirous of <unk> amongst his crew a man of Edmond ’ s value , had offered to advance him <unk> out of his future <unk> , which Edmond had accepted .
His next care on leaving the <unk> ’ s who had <unk> his first <unk> was to enter a shop and buy a complete sailor ’ s suit — a <unk> , as we all know , very simple , and <unk> of white trousers , a <unk> shirt , and a cap .
It was in this costume , and bringing back to Jacopo the shirt and trousers he had lent him , that Edmond reappeared before the captain of the <unk> , who had made him tell his story over and over again before he could believe him , or recognize in the <unk> and <unk> sailor the man with thick and <unk> beard , hair <unk> with <unk> , and body <unk> in <unk> , whom he had picked up naked and nearly <unk> .
<unk> by his <unk> appearance , he renewed his offers of an engagement to Dantès ; but Dantès , who had his own projects , would not agree for a longer time than three months .
_ La <unk> <unk> _ had a very active crew , very <unk> to their captain , who lost as little time as possible .
He had scarcely been a week at Leghorn before the hold of his vessel was filled with printed <unk> , <unk> <unk> , English powder , and <unk> on which the <unk> had forgotten to put its mark .
The master was to get all this out of Leghorn free of duties , and land it on the <unk> of Corsica , where certain <unk> <unk> to forward the <unk> to France .
They <unk> ; Edmond was again <unk> the azure sea which had been the first horizon of his youth , and which he had so often dreamed of in prison .
He left <unk> on his right and La <unk> on his left , and went towards the country of <unk> and Napoleon .
The next morning going on deck , as he always did at an early hour , the patron found Dantès leaning against the <unk> gazing with intense <unk> at a pile of granite rocks , which the rising sun <unk> with rosy light .
It was the Island of Monte Cristo .
_ La <unk> <unk> _ left it <unk> of a league to the <unk> and kept on for Corsica .
Dantès thought , as they passed so closely to the island whose name was so interesting to him , that he had only to <unk> into the sea and in half an hour be at the promised land .
But then what could he do without instruments to discover his treasure , without arms to defend himself ?
Besides , what would the sailors say ?
What would the patron think ?
He must wait .
Fortunately , Dantès had learned how to wait ; he had waited fourteen years for his liberty , and now he was free he could wait at least six months or a year for wealth .
Would he not have accepted liberty without riches if it had been offered to him ?
Besides , were not those riches <unk> ? — <unk> of the brain of the poor Abbé Faria , had they not died with him ?
It is true , the letter of the Cardinal Spada was <unk> <unk> , and Dantès repeated it to himself , from one end to the other , for he had not forgotten a word .
<unk> <unk> came , and Edmond saw the island <unk> with the shades of twilight , and then disappear in the darkness from all eyes but his own , for he , with vision accustomed to the gloom of a prison , continued to behold it last of all , for he remained alone upon deck .
The next <unk> broke off the coast of <unk> ; all day they <unk> , and in the evening saw <unk> lighted on land ; the position of these was no doubt a signal for landing , for a ship ’ s lantern was hung up at the <unk> instead of the <unk> , and they came to within a <unk> of the shore .
Dantès noticed that the captain of _ La <unk> <unk> _ had , as he <unk> the land , mounted two small <unk> , which , without making much noise , can throw a four <unk> ball a thousand paces or so .
But on this occasion the precaution was <unk> , and everything proceeded with the utmost <unk> and politeness .
Four <unk> came off with very little noise <unk> the <unk> , which , no doubt , in <unk> of the compliment , lowered her own <unk> into the sea , and the five <unk> worked so well that by two o ’ clock in the morning all the <unk> was out of _ La <unk> <unk> _ and on _ <unk> <unk> _ .
The same night , such a man of <unk> was the patron of _ La <unk> <unk> _ , the <unk> were divided , and each man had a hundred <unk> livres , or about eighty francs .
But the voyage was not ended .
They turned the <unk> towards <unk> , where they intended to take in a <unk> , which was to replace what had been discharged .
The second operation was as successful as the first , _ La <unk> <unk> _ was in luck .
This new <unk> was destined for the coast of the <unk> of <unk> , and consisted almost entirely of <unk> <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> <unk> .
There they had a bit of a <unk> in getting rid of the duties ; the <unk> was , in truth , the <unk> enemy of the patron of _ La <unk> <unk> _ .
A customs officer was laid low , and two sailors wounded ; Dantès was one of the latter , a ball having touched him in the left shoulder .
Dantès was almost glad of this <unk> , and almost pleased at being wounded , for they were rude <unk> which taught him with what eye he could view danger , and with what <unk> he could bear suffering .
He had contemplated danger with a smile , and when wounded had exclaimed with the great philosopher , “ <unk> , thou art not an evil . ” He had , moreover , looked upon the customs officer wounded to death , and , whether from heat of blood produced by the encounter , or the chill of human sentiment , this sight had made but slight impression upon him .
Dantès was on the way he desired to follow , and was moving towards the end he wished to <unk> ; his heart was in a fair way of <unk> in his bosom .
Jacopo , seeing him fall , had believed him killed , and rushing towards him raised him up , and then attended to him with all the kindness of a devoted comrade .
This world was not then so good as <unk> <unk> believed it , neither was it so wicked as Dantès thought it , since this man , who had nothing to expect from his comrade but the <unk> of his share of the <unk> , manifested so much sorrow when he saw him fall .
Fortunately , as we have said , Edmond was only wounded , and with certain <unk> gathered at certain <unk> , and sold to the smugglers by the old <unk> women , the wound soon closed .
Edmond then resolved to try Jacopo , and offered him in return for his attention a share of his <unk> , but Jacopo refused it <unk> .
As a result of the <unk> devotion which Jacopo had from the first bestowed on Edmond , the latter was moved to a certain degree of affection .
But this sufficed for Jacopo , who instinctively felt that Edmond had a right to superiority of position — a superiority which Edmond had concealed from all others .
And from this time the kindness which Edmond showed him was enough for the brave <unk> .
Then in the long days on board ship , when the vessel , <unk> on with security over the azure sea , required no care but the hand of the <unk> , thanks to the favorable <unk> that <unk> her sails , Edmond , with a <unk> in his hand , became the <unk> of Jacopo , as the poor Abbé Faria had been his <unk> .
He pointed out to him the <unk> of the coast , explained to him the <unk> of the <unk> , and taught him to read in that vast book opened over our heads which they call heaven , and where God writes in azure with letters of diamonds .
And when Jacopo inquired of him , “ What is the use of <unk> all these things to a poor sailor like me ? ” Edmond replied , “ Who knows ?
You may one day be the captain of a vessel .
Your <unk> , Bonaparte , became emperor . ” We had forgotten to say that Jacopo was a Corsican .
Two months and a half elapsed in these <unk> , and Edmond had become as skilful a <unk> as he had been a <unk> <unk> ; he had formed an acquaintance with all the smugglers on the coast , and learned all the <unk> signs by which these half <unk> recognize each other .
He had passed and <unk> his Island of Monte Cristo twenty times , but not once had he found an opportunity of landing there .
He then formed a resolution .
As soon as his engagement with the patron of _ La <unk> <unk> _ ended , he would <unk> a small vessel on his own account — for in his several <unk> he had <unk> a hundred piastres — and under some pretext land at the Island of Monte Cristo .
Then he would be free to make his <unk> , not perhaps entirely at liberty , for he would be doubtless watched by those who accompanied him .
But in this world we must risk something .
<unk> had made Edmond prudent , and he was desirous of running no risk whatever .
But in vain did he <unk> his imagination ; <unk> as it was , he could not <unk> any plan for reaching the island without <unk> .
Dantès was tossed about on these doubts and wishes , when the patron , who had great confidence in him , and was very desirous of <unk> him in his service , took him by the arm one evening and led him to a tavern on the <unk> del ’ <unk> , where the leading smugglers of Leghorn used to <unk> and <unk> affairs connected with their trade .
<unk> Dantès had visited this <unk> <unk> two or three times , and seeing all these <unk> <unk> , who supplied the whole coast for nearly two hundred leagues in extent , he had asked himself what power might not that man <unk> who should give the impulse of his will to all these contrary and <unk> minds .
This time it was a great matter that was under discussion , connected with a vessel <unk> with <unk> <unk> , <unk> of the <unk> , and <unk> .
It was necessary to find some <unk> ground on which an exchange could be made , and then to try and land these <unk> on the coast of France .
If the venture was successful the profit would be enormous , there would be a gain of fifty or sixty piastres each for the crew .
The patron of _ La <unk> <unk> _ proposed as a place of landing the Island of Monte Cristo , which being completely deserted , and having neither soldiers nor <unk> officers , seemed to have been placed in the midst of the ocean since the time of the <unk> <unk> by <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , <unk> of mankind which we in modern times have separated if not made distinct , but which <unk> appears to have included in the same <unk> .
At the mention of Monte Cristo Dantès started with joy ; he rose to conceal his emotion , and took a turn around the <unk> tavern , where all the <unk> of the known world were <unk> in a _ <unk> <unk> _ .
When he again joined the two persons who had been <unk> the matter , it had been decided that they should touch at Monte Cristo and set out on the following night .
Edmond , being consulted , was of opinion that the island afforded every possible security , and that great <unk> to be well done should be done quickly .
Nothing then was altered in the plan , and orders were given to get under <unk> next night , and , wind and weather <unk> , to make the <unk> island by the following day .
<unk> Chapter <unk> .
The Island of Monte Cristo Thus , at length , by one of the unexpected <unk> of fortune which sometimes <unk> those who have for a long time been the <unk> of an evil destiny , Dantès was about to secure the opportunity he wished for , by simple and natural means , and land on the island without <unk> any suspicion .
One night more and he would be on his way .
The night was one of feverish <unk> , and in its progress <unk> , good and evil , passed through Dantès ’ mind .
If he closed his eyes , he saw Cardinal Spada ’ s letter written on the wall in characters of flame — if he slept for a moment the <unk> dreams <unk> his brain .
He ascended into <unk> <unk> with <unk> , with <unk> of <unk> , and the roof <unk> with diamond <unk> .
<unk> fell drop by drop , as subterranean waters <unk> in their <unk> .
Edmond , amazed , <unk> , filled his pockets with the radiant <unk> and then returned to daylight , when he discovered that his <unk> had all changed into common <unk> .
He then endeavored to <unk> the marvellous <unk> , but they had suddenly <unk> , and now the path became a <unk> , and then the entrance vanished , and in vain did he tax his memory for the <unk> and mysterious word which opened the splendid <unk> of Ali <unk> to the Arabian <unk> .
All was useless , the treasure disappeared , and had again <unk> to the <unk> from whom for a moment he had hoped to carry it off .
The day came at length , and was almost as feverish as the night had been , but it brought reason to the aid of imagination , and Dantès was then enabled to arrange a plan which had hitherto been vague and <unk> in his brain .
Night came , and with it the preparation for departure , and these <unk> served to conceal Dantès ’ agitation .
He had by degrees assumed such authority over his companions that he was almost like a <unk> on board ; and as his orders were always clear , distinct , and easy of execution , his comrades obeyed him with <unk> and pleasure .
The old patron did not interfere , for he too had recognized the superiority of Dantès over the crew and himself .
He saw in the young man his natural <unk> , and regretted that he had not a daughter , that he might have bound Edmond to him by a more secure alliance .
At seven o ’ clock in the evening all was ready , and at ten minutes past seven they <unk> the <unk> just as the <unk> was <unk> .
The sea was calm , and , with a fresh breeze from the <unk> , they <unk> beneath a bright blue sky , in which God also lighted up in turn his <unk> lights , each of which is a world .
Dantès told them that all hands might turn in , and he would take the <unk> .
When the <unk> ( for so they called Dantès ) had said this , it was sufficient , and all went to their <unk> <unk> .
This frequently happened .
Dantès , cast from solitude into the world , frequently experienced an <unk> desire for solitude ; and what solitude is more complete , or more <unk> , than that of a ship floating in <unk> on the sea during the obscurity of the night , in the silence of <unk> , and under the eye of Heaven ?
Now this solitude was <unk> with his thoughts , the night lighted up by his <unk> , and the silence animated by his <unk> .
When the patron awoke , the vessel was hurrying on with every sail set , and every sail full with the breeze .
They were making nearly ten <unk> an hour .
The Island of Monte Cristo <unk> large in the horizon .
Edmond resigned the <unk> to the master ’ s care , and went and lay down in his <unk> ; but , in spite of a <unk> night , he could not close his eyes for a moment .
Two hours afterwards he came on deck , as the boat was about to double the Island of Elba .
They were just <unk> of <unk> , and beyond the flat but <unk> Island of La <unk> .
The <unk> of Monte Cristo <unk> by the burning sun , was seen against the azure sky .
Dantès ordered the <unk> to put down his <unk> , in order to leave La <unk> to <unk> , as he knew that he should <unk> his course by two or three <unk> .
About five o ’ clock in the evening the island was distinct , and everything on it was plainly <unk> , owing to that <unk> of the <unk> peculiar to the light which the rays of the sun cast at its setting .
Edmond gazed very earnestly at the mass of rocks which gave out all the variety of twilight colors , from the <unk> pink to the <unk> blue ; and from time to time his cheeks <unk> , his brow <unk> , and a mist passed over his eyes .
Never did a <unk> , whose whole fortune is <unk> on one cast of the die , experience the anguish which Edmond felt in his <unk> of hope .
Night came , and at ten o ’ clock they <unk> .
_ La <unk> <unk> _ was first at the <unk> .
In spite of his usual command over himself , Dantès could not restrain his <unk> .
He was the first to <unk> on shore ; and had he dared , he would , like <unk> <unk> , have “ kissed his mother earth . ” It was dark , but at eleven o ’ clock the moon rose in the midst of the ocean , whose every wave she <unk> , and then , “ <unk> high , ” played in <unk> of pale light on the <unk> hills of this second <unk> .
The island was familiar to the crew of _ La <unk> <unk> _ , — it was one of her regular <unk> .
As to Dantès , he had passed it on his voyage to and from the <unk> , but never touched at it .
He questioned Jacopo .
“ Where shall we pass the night ? ” he inquired .
“ Why , on board the <unk> , ” replied the sailor .
“ Should we not do better in the <unk> ? ” “ What <unk> ? ” “ Why , the <unk> — <unk> of the island . ” “ I do not know of any <unk> , ” replied Jacopo .
The cold <unk> sprang forth on Dantès ’ brow .
“ What , are there no <unk> at Monte Cristo ? ” he asked .
“ None . ” For a moment Dantès was <unk> ; then he remembered that these <unk> might have been filled up by some accident , or even stopped up , for the sake of greater security , by Cardinal Spada .
The point was , then , to discover the hidden entrance .
It was useless to search at night , and Dantès therefore delayed all <unk> until the morning .
Besides , a signal made half a league out at sea , and to which _ La <unk> <unk> _ replied by a similar signal , indicated that the moment for business had come .
The boat that now arrived , assured by the answering signal that all was well , soon came in sight , white and silent as a phantom , and cast anchor within a <unk> ’ s length of shore .
Then the landing began .
Dantès reflected , as he worked , on the shout of joy which , with a single word , he could <unk> from all these men , if he gave utterance to the one <unk> thought that <unk> his heart ; but , far from <unk> this precious secret , he almost feared that he had already said too much , and by his <unk> and continual questions , his minute <unk> and evident <unk> , aroused suspicions .
Fortunately , as regarded this circumstance at least , his painful past gave to his countenance an <unk> sadness , and the <unk> of gayety seen beneath this cloud were indeed but <unk> .
No one had the slightest suspicion ; and when next day , taking a <unk> , powder , and shot , Dantès declared his intention to go and kill some of the wild <unk> that were seen <unk> from rock to rock , his wish was <unk> into a love of <unk> , or a desire for solitude .
However , Jacopo insisted on following him , and Dantès did not oppose this , fearing if he did so that he might <unk> distrust .
<unk> , however , had they gone a quarter of a league when , having killed a <unk> , he begged Jacopo to take it to his comrades , and request them to <unk> it , and when ready to let him know by firing a gun .
This and some dried <unk> and a <unk> of Monte <unk> , was the bill of <unk> .
Dantès went on , looking from time to time behind and around about him .
Having reached the summit of a rock , he saw , a thousand feet beneath him , his companions , whom Jacopo had <unk> , and who were all busy preparing the <unk> which Edmond ’ s skill as a <unk> had augmented with a capital <unk> .
Edmond looked at them for a moment with the sad and gentle smile of a man superior to his fellows .
“ In two hours ’ time , ” said he , “ these persons will depart <unk> by fifty piastres each , to go and risk their lives again by endeavoring to gain fifty more ; then they will return with a fortune of six hundred francs , and waste this treasure in some city with the pride of <unk> and the <unk> of <unk> .
At this moment hope makes me <unk> their riches , which seem to me <unk> .
Yet <unk> tomorrow <unk> will so act on me , that I shall , on <unk> , consider such a <unk> possession as the utmost happiness .
Oh , no ! ” exclaimed Edmond , “ that will not be .
The wise , <unk> Faria could not be mistaken in this one thing .
Besides , it were better to die than to continue to lead this low and wretched life . ” Thus Dantès , who but three months before had no desire but liberty had now not liberty enough , and <unk> for wealth .
The cause was not in Dantès , but in Providence , who , while <unk> the power of man , has filled him with <unk> desires .
Meanwhile , by a <unk> between two walls of rock , following a path worn by a <unk> , and which , in all human probability , human foot had never before <unk> , Dantès approached the spot where he supposed the <unk> must have existed .
<unk> along the shore , and examining the smallest object with serious attention , he thought he could trace , on certain rocks , marks made by the hand of man .
<unk> , which <unk> all physical <unk> with its <unk> mantle , as it <unk> all things of the mind with forgetfulness , seemed to have respected these signs , which apparently had been made with some degree of <unk> , and probably with a <unk> purpose .
<unk> the marks were hidden under <unk> of <unk> , which spread into large <unk> <unk> with <unk> , or beneath <unk> <unk> .
So Edmond had to separate the branches or <unk> away the <unk> to know where the <unk> were .
The sight of marks renewed Edmond <unk> hopes .
<unk> it not have been the <unk> himself who had first traced them , in order that they might serve as a guide for his nephew in the event of a catastrophe , which he could not <unk> would have been so complete .
This solitary place was precisely suited to the requirements of a man desirous of <unk> treasure .
Only , might not these <unk> marks have attracted other eyes than those for whom they were made ?
and had the dark and <unk> island indeed <unk> guarded its precious secret ?
<unk> It seemed , however , to Edmond , who was hidden from his comrades by the <unk> of the ground , that at sixty paces from the <unk> the marks ceased ; nor did they <unk> at any grotto .
A large round rock , placed <unk> on its base , was the only spot to which they seemed to lead .
Edmond concluded that perhaps instead of having reached the end of the <unk> he had only <unk> its beginning , and he therefore turned round and <unk> his steps .
Meanwhile his comrades had prepared the <unk> , had got some water from a spring , spread out the fruit and bread , and <unk> the <unk> .
Just at the moment when they were taking the <unk> animal from the <unk> , they saw Edmond <unk> with the <unk> of a <unk> from rock to rock , and they fired the signal agreed upon .
The <unk> instantly changed his direction , and ran quickly towards them .
But even while they watched his daring progress , Edmond ’ s foot slipped , and they saw him <unk> on the edge of a rock and disappear .
They all rushed towards him , for all loved Edmond in spite of his superiority ; yet Jacopo reached him first .
He found Edmond lying <unk> , bleeding , and almost <unk> .
He had rolled down a <unk> of twelve or fifteen feet .
They poured a little <unk> down his throat , and this remedy which had before been so <unk> to him , produced the same effect as formerly .
Edmond opened his eyes , <unk> of great pain in his knee , a feeling of <unk> in his head , and severe pains in his <unk> .
They wished to carry him to the shore ; but when they touched him , although under Jacopo ’ s directions , he declared , with heavy <unk> , that he could not bear to be moved .
It may be supposed that Dantès did not now think of his dinner , but he insisted that his comrades , who had not his reasons for <unk> , should have their <unk> .
As for himself , he declared that he had only need of a little rest , and that when they returned he should be <unk> .
The sailors did not require much <unk> .
They were hungry , and the smell of the <unk> <unk> was very <unk> , and your <unk> are not very <unk> .
An hour afterwards they returned .
All that Edmond had been able to do was to drag himself about a dozen paces forward to <unk> against a <unk> rock .
But , instead of growing <unk> , Dantès ’ pains appeared to increase in violence .
The old patron , who was obliged to sail in the morning in order to land his <unk> on the <unk> of <unk> and France , between <unk> and <unk> , urged Dantès to try and rise .
Edmond made great <unk> in order to comply ; but at each effort he fell back , <unk> and turning pale .
“ He has broken his <unk> , ” said the <unk> , in a low voice .
“ No matter ; he is an excellent fellow , and we must not leave him .
We will try and carry him on board the <unk> . ” Dantès declared , however , that he would rather die where he was than <unk> the agony which the slightest movement cost him .
“ Well , ” said the patron , “ let what may happen , it shall never be said that we deserted a good comrade like you .
We will not go till evening . ” This very much astonished the sailors , although , not one opposed it .
The patron was so strict that this was the first time they had ever seen him give up an <unk> , or even delay in its execution .
Dantès would not allow that any such <unk> of regular and proper <unk> should be made in his favor .
“ No , no , ” he said to the patron , “ I was awkward , and it is just that I pay the <unk> of my <unk> .
Leave me a small supply of <unk> , a gun , powder , and balls , to kill the <unk> or defend myself at need , and a <unk> , that I may <unk> a shelter if you delay in coming back for me . ” “ But you ’ ll die of hunger , ” said the patron .
“ I would rather do so , ” was Edmond ’ s reply , “ than suffer the <unk> <unk> which the slightest movement causes me . ” The patron turned towards his vessel , which was rolling on the <unk> in the little <unk> , and , with sails partly set , would be ready for sea when her toilet should be completed .
“ What are we to do , <unk> ? ” asked the captain .
“ We cannot leave you here so , and yet we cannot stay . ” “ Go , go ! ” exclaimed Dantès .
“ We shall be absent at least a week , ” said the patron , “ and then we must run out of our course to come here and take you up again . ” “ Why , ” said Dantès , “ if in two or three days you <unk> any <unk> , desire them to come here to me .
I will pay twenty-five piastres for my passage back to Leghorn .
If you do not come across one , return for me . ” The patron shook his head .
“ Listen , Captain <unk> ; there ’ s one way of <unk> this , ” said Jacopo .
“ Do you go , and I will stay and take care of the wounded man . ” “ And give up your share of the venture , ” said Edmond , “ to remain with me ? ” “ Yes , ” said Jacopo , “ and without any hesitation . ” “ You are a good fellow and a <unk> <unk> , ” replied Edmond , “ and heaven will recompense you for your generous intentions ; but I do not wish anyone to stay with me .
A day or two of rest will set me up , and I hope I shall find among the rocks certain <unk> most excellent for <unk> . ” A peculiar smile passed over Dantès ’ lips ; he <unk> Jacopo ’ s hand warmly , but nothing could shake his determination to remain — and remain alone .
The smugglers left with Edmond what he had requested and set sail , but not without turning about several times , and each time making signs of a <unk> farewell , to which Edmond replied with his hand only , as if he could not move the rest of his body .
Then , when they had disappeared , he said with a smile , — “ ’ Tis strange that it should be among such men that we find proofs of friendship and devotion . ” Then he dragged himself <unk> to the top of a rock , from which he had a full view of the sea , and thence he saw the <unk> complete her <unk> for <unk> , <unk> anchor , and , <unk> herself as <unk> as a <unk> ere it takes to the wing , set sail .
At the end of an hour she was completely out of sight ; at least , it was impossible for the wounded man to see her any longer from the spot where he was .
Then Dantès rose more <unk> and light than the <unk> among the <unk> and <unk> of these wild rocks , took his gun in one hand , his <unk> in the other , and hastened towards the rock on which the marks he had <unk> <unk> .
“ And now , ” he exclaimed , <unk> the tale of the Arabian <unk> , which Faria had related to him , “ now , <unk> <unk> ! ” Chapter <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> The sun had nearly reached the <unk> , and his <unk> rays fell full on the rocks , which seemed themselves sensible of the heat .
<unk> of <unk> , hidden in the <unk> , <unk> with a <unk> and dull note ; the leaves of the <unk> and <unk> trees <unk> and <unk> in the wind .
At every step that Edmond took he disturbed the <unk> <unk> with the <unk> of the <unk> ; <unk> off he saw the wild <unk> <unk> from <unk> to <unk> .
In a word , the island was inhabited , yet Edmond felt himself alone , guided by the hand of God .
He felt an indescribable sensation somewhat <unk> to dread — that dread of the daylight which even in the desert makes us fear we are watched and observed .
This feeling was so strong that at the moment when Edmond was about to begin his labor , he stopped , laid down his <unk> , seized his gun , mounted to the summit of the highest rock , and from thence gazed round in every direction .
But it was not upon Corsica , the very houses of which he could distinguish ; or on <unk> ; or on the Island of Elba , with its <unk> <unk> ; or upon the almost imperceptible line that to the experienced eye of a sailor alone revealed the coast of <unk> the proud , and Leghorn the <unk> , that he gazed .
It was at the <unk> that had left in the morning , and the <unk> that had just set sail , that Edmond fixed his eyes .
The first was just <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> ; the other , following an opposite direction , was about to round the Island of Corsica .
This sight reassured him .
He then looked at the objects near him .
He saw that he was on the highest point of the island , — a statue on this vast <unk> of granite , nothing human appearing in sight , while the blue ocean beat against the base of the island , and covered it with a <unk> of <unk> .
Then he descended with <unk> and slow step , for he dreaded lest an accident similar to that he had so <unk> <unk> should happen in reality .
Dantès , as we have said , had traced the marks along the rocks , and he had noticed that they led to a small <unk> , which was hidden like the <unk> of some ancient <unk> .
This <unk> was sufficiently wide at its mouth , and deep in the centre , to admit of the entrance of a small vessel of the <unk> class , which would be perfectly concealed from observation .
Then following the <unk> that , in the hands of the Abbé Faria , had been so <unk> used to guide him through the <unk> <unk> of <unk> , he thought that the Cardinal Spada , anxious not to be watched , had entered the <unk> , concealed his little <unk> , followed the line marked by the <unk> in the rock , and at the end of it had buried his treasure .
It was this idea that had brought Dantès back to the <unk> rock .
One thing only <unk> Edmond , and destroyed his theory .
How could this rock , which weighed several <unk> , have been lifted to this spot , without the aid of many men ?
Suddenly an idea <unk> across his mind .
<unk> of raising it , thought he , they have lowered it .
And he sprang from the rock in order to <unk> the base on which it had formerly stood .
He soon perceived that a slope had been formed , and the rock had <unk> along this until it stopped at the spot it now occupied .
A large stone had served as a <unk> ; <unk> and <unk> had been <unk> around it , so as to conceal the <unk> ; this species of <unk> had been covered with earth , and grass and <unk> had grown there , <unk> had clung to the stones , <unk> had taken <unk> , and the old rock seemed fixed to the earth .
<unk> Dantès dug away the earth carefully , and <unk> , or fancied he <unk> , the ingenious <unk> .
He attacked this wall , <unk> by the hand of time , with his <unk> .
After ten minutes ’ labor the wall gave way , and a hole large enough to <unk> the arm was opened .
Dantès went and cut the <unk> <unk> he could find , <unk> off its branches , <unk> it in the hole , and used it as a <unk> .
But the rock was too heavy , and too firmly <unk> , to be moved by anyone man , were he <unk> himself .
Dantès saw that he must attack the <unk> .
But how ?
He cast his eyes around , and saw the <unk> full of powder which his friend Jacopo had left him .
He smiled ; the <unk> <unk> would serve him for this purpose .
With the aid of his <unk> , Dantès , after the manner of a <unk> <unk> , dug a mine between the upper rock and the one that supported it , filled it with powder , then made a match by rolling his handkerchief in <unk> .
He lighted it and retired .
The <unk> soon followed ; the upper rock was lifted from its base by the <unk> force of the powder ; the lower one flew into pieces ; thousands of <unk> escaped from the aperture Dantès had previously formed , and a huge <unk> , like the <unk> <unk> of the treasure , rolled himself along in <unk> <unk> , and disappeared .
Dantès approached the upper rock , which now , without any support , leaned towards the sea .
The <unk> <unk> walked round it , and , <unk> the spot from whence it appeared most <unk> to attack , placed his <unk> in one of the <unk> , and <unk> every <unk> to move the mass .
The rock , already shaken by the <unk> , <unk> on its base .
Dantès redoubled his efforts ; he seemed like one of the ancient <unk> , who <unk> the mountains to <unk> against the father of the <unk> .
The rock yielded , rolled over , bounded from point to point , and finally disappeared in the ocean .
On the spot it had occupied was a <unk> space , <unk> an iron ring let into a square <unk> .
Dantès uttered a cry of joy and surprise ; never had a first attempt been crowned with more perfect success .
He would <unk> have continued , but his knees trembled , and his heart beat so violently , and his sight became so dim , that he was forced to pause .
This feeling lasted but for a moment .
Edmond <unk> his <unk> in the ring and <unk> all his strength ; the <unk> yielded , and <unk> steps that descended until they were lost in the obscurity of a <unk> grotto .
<unk> else would have rushed on with a cry of joy .
Dantès turned pale , hesitated , and reflected .
“ Come , ” said he to himself , “ be a man .
I am accustomed to <unk> .
I must not be cast down by the discovery that I have been deceived .
What , then , would be the use of all I have suffered ?
The heart <unk> when , after having been <unk> by <unk> hopes , it sees all its <unk> destroyed .
Faria has dreamed this ; the Cardinal Spada buried no treasure here ; perhaps he never came here , or if he did , Cæsar <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> and <unk> <unk> , has followed him , discovered his traces , pursued them as I have done , raised the stone , and descending before me , has left me nothing . ” He remained motionless and <unk> , his eyes fixed on the gloomy aperture that was open at his feet .
“ Now that I expect nothing , now that I no longer entertain the slightest hopes , the end of this adventure becomes simply a matter of curiosity . ” And he remained again motionless and thoughtful .
“ Yes , yes ; this is an adventure worthy a place in the varied career of that royal bandit .
This <unk> event formed but a <unk> in a long chain of <unk> .
Yes , <unk> has been here , a torch in one hand , a sword in the other , and within twenty paces , at the foot of this rock , perhaps two guards kept watch on land and sea , while their master descended , as I am about to descend , <unk> the darkness before his <unk> progress . ” <unk> “ But what was the fate of the guards who thus possessed his secret ? ” asked Dantès of himself .
“ The fate , ” replied he , smiling , “ of those who buried <unk> , and were <unk> with the corpse . ” “ Yet , had he come , ” thought Dantès , “ he would have found the treasure , and <unk> , he who compared Italy to an <unk> , which he could <unk> <unk> by <unk> , knew too well the value of time to waste it in <unk> this rock .
I will go down . ” Then he descended , a smile on his lips , and <unk> that last word of human philosophy , “ Perhaps ! ” But instead of the darkness , and the thick and <unk> <unk> he had expected to find , Dantès saw a dim and <unk> light , which , as well as the air , entered , not merely by the aperture he had just formed , but by the <unk> and <unk> of the rock which were visible from without , and through which he could distinguish the blue sky and the <unk> branches of the <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> that grew from the rocks .
After having stood a few minutes in the cavern , the <unk> of which was rather warm than damp , Dantès ’ eye , <unk> as it was to darkness , could <unk> even to the <unk> angles of the cavern , which was of granite that <unk> like diamonds .
“ Alas , ” said Edmond , smiling , “ these are the treasures the <unk> has left ; and the good abbé , seeing in a dream these <unk> walls , has indulged in <unk> hopes . ” But he called to mind the words of the will , which he knew by heart .
“ In the <unk> angle of the second opening , ” said the <unk> ’ s will .
He had only found the first grotto ; he had now to seek the second .
Dantès continued his search .
He reflected that this second grotto must penetrate deeper into the island ; he examined the stones , and sounded one part of the wall where he fancied the opening existed , masked for precaution ’ s sake .
The <unk> struck for a moment with a dull sound that drew out of Dantès ’ forehead large drops of perspiration .
At last it seemed to him that one part of the wall gave forth a more hollow and deeper <unk> ; he eagerly advanced , and with the <unk> of <unk> that no one but a prisoner possesses , saw that there , in all probability , the opening must be .
However , he , like Cæsar <unk> , knew the value of time ; and , in order to avoid <unk> toil , he sounded all the other walls with his <unk> , struck the earth with the <unk> of his gun , and finding nothing that appeared suspicious , returned to that part of the wall whence <unk> the <unk> sound he had before heard .
He again struck it , and with greater force .
Then a singular thing occurred .
As he struck the wall , pieces of <unk> similar to that used in the ground work of <unk> broke off , and fell to the ground in <unk> , <unk> a large white stone .
The aperture of the rock had been closed with stones , then this <unk> had been applied , and painted to <unk> granite .
Dantès struck with the sharp end of his <unk> , which entered <unk> between the <unk> .
It was there he must <unk> .
But by some strange play of emotion , in proportion as the proofs that Faria , had not been deceived became stronger , so did his heart give way , and a feeling of <unk> stole over him .
This last proof , instead of giving him fresh strength , deprived him of it ; the <unk> descended , or rather fell ; he placed it on the ground , passed his hand over his brow , and <unk> the stairs , <unk> to himself , as an excuse , a desire to be assured that no one was watching him , but in reality because he felt that he was about to faint .
The island was deserted , and the sun seemed to cover it with its <unk> glance ; <unk> off , a few small <unk> <unk> <unk> the bosom of the blue ocean .
Dantès had <unk> nothing , but he thought not of hunger at such a moment ; he hastily swallowed a few drops of <unk> , and again entered the cavern .
The <unk> that had seemed so heavy , was now like a <unk> in his grasp ; he seized it , and attacked the wall .
After several blows he perceived that the stones were not <unk> , but had been merely placed one upon the other , and covered with <unk> ; he <unk> the point of his <unk> , and using the handle as a <unk> , with joy soon saw the stone turn as if on hinges , and fall at his feet .
He had nothing more to do now , but with the iron <unk> of the <unk> to draw the stones towards him one by one .
The aperture was already sufficiently large for him to enter , but by waiting , he could still <unk> to hope , and <unk> the certainty of <unk> .
At last , after renewed hesitation , Dantès entered the second grotto .
The second grotto was lower and more gloomy than the first ; the air that could only enter by the <unk> formed opening had the <unk> smell Dantès was surprised not to find in the outer cavern .
He waited in order to allow pure air to <unk> the foul <unk> , and then went on .
At the left of the opening was a dark and deep angle .
But to Dantès ’ eye there was no darkness .
He glanced around this second grotto ; it was , like the first , empty .
The treasure , if it existed , was buried in this corner .
The time had at length arrived ; two feet of earth removed , and Dantès ’ fate would be decided .
He advanced towards the angle , and <unk> all his resolution , attacked the ground with the <unk> .
At the fifth or <unk> blow the <unk> struck against an iron substance .
Never did funeral <unk> , never did <unk> , produce a greater effect on the <unk> .
Had Dantès found nothing he could not have become more ghastly pale .
He again struck his <unk> into the earth , and encountered the same resistance , but not the same sound .
“ It is a <unk> of wood bound with iron , ” thought he .
At this moment a shadow passed rapidly before the opening ; Dantès seized his gun , sprang through the opening , and mounted the <unk> .
A wild <unk> had passed before the mouth of the <unk> , and was <unk> at a little distance .
This would have been a favorable occasion to secure his dinner ; but Dantès feared lest the report of his gun should attract attention .
He thought a moment , cut a branch of a <unk> tree , lighted it at the fire at which the smugglers had prepared their breakfast , and descended with this torch .
He wished to see everything .
He approached the hole he had dug , and now , with the aid of the torch , saw that his <unk> had in reality struck against iron and wood .
He planted his torch in the ground and resumed his labor .
In an instant a space three feet long by two feet broad was cleared , and Dantès could see an <unk> <unk> , bound with cut steel ; in the middle of the <unk> he saw <unk> on a silver plate , which was still <unk> , the arms of the Spada family — <unk> . , a sword , _ en pale _ , on an <unk> <unk> , like all the Italian <unk> <unk> , and surmounted by a <unk> ’ s hat .
Dantès easily recognized them , Faria had so often drawn them for him .
There was no longer any doubt : the treasure was there — no one would have been at such pains to conceal an empty <unk> .
In an instant he had cleared every obstacle away , and he saw <unk> the lock , placed between two <unk> , and the two <unk> at each end , all <unk> as things were <unk> at that epoch , when art rendered the <unk> <unk> precious .
Dantès seized the <unk> , and strove to lift the <unk> ; it was impossible .
He sought to open it ; lock and <unk> were fastened ; these faithful <unk> seemed unwilling to <unk> their trust .
Dantès <unk> the sharp end of the <unk> between the <unk> and the <unk> , and pressing with all his force on the handle , burst open the <unk> .
The hinges yielded in their turn and fell , still holding in their grasp <unk> of the wood , and the chest was open .
<unk> Edmond was seized with <unk> ; he <unk> his gun and laid it beside him .
He then closed his eyes as children do in order that they may see in the <unk> night of their own imagination more stars than are visible in the <unk> ; then he <unk> them , and stood motionless with amazement .
Three <unk> divided the <unk> .
In the first , <unk> <unk> of golden coin ; in the second , were <unk> bars of <unk> gold , which possessed nothing <unk> save their value ; in the third , Edmond grasped <unk> of diamonds , pearls , and <unk> , which , as they fell on one another , sounded like <unk> against glass .
After having touched , felt , examined these treasures , Edmond rushed through the <unk> like a man seized with <unk> ; he leaped on a rock , from whence he could behold the sea .
He was alone — alone with these <unk> , these <unk> treasures !
Was he awake , or was it but a dream ?
Was it a <unk> vision , or was he face to face with reality ?
He would <unk> have gazed upon his gold , and yet he had not strength enough ; for an instant he leaned his head in his hands as if to prevent his senses from leaving him , and then rushed <unk> about the rocks of Monte Cristo , <unk> the wild <unk> and <unk> the <unk> with his wild cries and <unk> ; then he returned , and , still unable to believe the evidence of his senses , rushed into the grotto , and found himself before this mine of gold and jewels .
This time he fell on his knees , and , <unk> his hands convulsively , uttered a prayer <unk> to God alone .
He soon became <unk> and more happy , for only now did he begin to realize his felicity .
He then set himself to work to count his fortune .
There were a thousand <unk> of gold , each <unk> from two to three pounds ; then he <unk> up twenty-five thousand crowns , each worth about eighty francs of our money , and bearing the <unk> of Alexander <unk> .
and his <unk> ; and he saw that the <unk> was not half empty .
And he measured ten double <unk> of pearls , diamonds , and other <unk> , many of which , mounted by the most famous <unk> , were valuable beyond their <unk> worth .
Dantès saw the light gradually disappear , and fearing to be surprised in the cavern , left it , his gun in his hand .
A piece of <unk> and a small quantity of <unk> formed his supper , and he <unk> a few hours ’ sleep , lying over the mouth of the <unk> .
It was a night of joy and terror , such as this man of <unk> emotions had already experienced twice or <unk> in his <unk> .
Chapter <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> , for which Dantès had so eagerly and impatiently waited with open eyes , again <unk> .
With the first light Dantès resumed his search .
Again he <unk> the <unk> height he had ascended the previous evening , and <unk> his view to catch every peculiarity of the <unk> ; but it wore the same wild , <unk> aspect when seen by the rays of the morning sun which it had done when <unk> by the <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
<unk> into the grotto , he lifted the stone , filled his pockets with <unk> , put the box together as well and <unk> as he could , <unk> fresh sand over the spot from which it had been taken , and then carefully <unk> down the earth to give it everywhere a uniform appearance ; then , quitting the grotto , he replaced the stone , <unk> on it broken masses of rocks and rough <unk> of <unk> granite , <unk> the <unk> with earth , into which he <unk> <unk> rapidly growing plants , such as the wild <unk> and <unk> <unk> , then carefully <unk> these new <unk> , he <unk> <unk> every trace of footsteps , leaving the approach to the cavern as <unk> and <unk> as he had found it .
This done , he impatiently awaited the return of his companions .
To wait at Monte Cristo for the purpose of watching like a <unk> over the almost <unk> riches that had thus fallen into his possession satisfied not the <unk> of his heart , which <unk> to return to dwell among mankind , and to assume the rank , power , and influence which are always <unk> to wealth — that first and greatest of all the forces within the grasp of man .
On the <unk> day , the smugglers returned .
From a distance Dantès recognized the <unk> and <unk> of _ La <unk> <unk> _ , and dragging himself with affected difficulty towards the <unk> , he met his companions with an assurance that , although <unk> better than when they quitted him , he still suffered <unk> from his late accident .
He then inquired how they had <unk> in their trip .
To this question the smugglers replied that , although successful in landing their <unk> in safety , they had scarcely done so when they received intelligence that a <unk> had just quitted the port of Toulon and was <unk> all sail towards them .
This obliged them to make all the speed they could to <unk> the enemy , when they could but <unk> the absence of Dantès , whose superior skill in the <unk> of a vessel would have <unk> them so <unk> .
In fact , the pursuing vessel had almost <unk> them when , fortunately , night came on , and enabled them to double the <unk> of Corsica , and so <unk> all further pursuit .
Upon the whole , however , the trip had been sufficiently successful to satisfy all concerned ; while the crew , and particularly Jacopo , expressed great <unk> that Dantès had not been an equal <unk> with themselves in the <unk> , which <unk> to no less a sum than fifty piastres each .
<unk> Edmond preserved the most admirable <unk> , not suffering the <unk> <unk> of a smile to escape him at the <unk> of all the <unk> he would have <unk> had he been able to quit the island ; but as _ La <unk> <unk> _ had merely come to Monte Cristo to fetch him away , he <unk> that same evening , and proceeded with the captain to Leghorn .
<unk> at Leghorn , he <unk> to the house of a <unk> , a <unk> in precious stones , to whom he disposed of four of his smallest diamonds for five thousand francs each .
Dantès half feared that such valuable jewels in the hands of a poor sailor like himself might excite suspicion ; but the cunning <unk> asked no troublesome questions concerning a <unk> by which he gained a round profit of at least eighty per <unk> .
The following day Dantès presented Jacopo with an entirely new vessel , <unk> the gift by a <unk> of one hundred piastres , that he might provide himself with a suitable crew and other <unk> for his <unk> , upon condition that he would go at once to Marseilles for the purpose of <unk> after an old man named Louis Dantès , <unk> in the <unk> de <unk> , and also a young woman called Mercédès , an <unk> of the <unk> village .
Jacopo could scarcely believe his senses at receiving this magnificent present , which Dantès hastened to account for by saying that he had merely been a sailor from <unk> and a desire to spite his family , who did not allow him as much money as he liked to spend ; but that on his arrival at Leghorn he had come into possession of a large fortune , left him by an uncle , whose sole heir he was .
The superior education of Dantès gave an air of such extreme probability to this statement that it never once occurred to Jacopo to doubt its <unk> .
The <unk> for which Edmond had engaged to serve on board _ La <unk> <unk> _ having <unk> , Dantès took leave of the captain , who at first tried all his powers of <unk> to induce him to remain as one of the crew , but having been told the history of the <unk> , he ceased to <unk> him further .
The following morning Jacopo set sail for Marseilles , with directions from Dantès to join him at the Island of Monte Cristo .
Having seen Jacopo fairly out of the <unk> , Dantès proceeded to make his final <unk> on board _ La <unk> <unk> _ , distributing so liberal a <unk> among her crew as to secure for him the good wishes of all , and expressions of <unk> interest in all that concerned him .
To the captain he promised to write when he had made up his mind as to his future plans .
Then Dantès departed for <unk> .
At the moment of his arrival a small yacht was under trial in the <unk> ; this yacht had been built by order of an Englishman , who , having heard that the <unk> <unk> all other <unk> along the <unk> of the <unk> in the construction of <unk> <unk> , was desirous of <unk> a <unk> of their skill ; the price agreed upon between the Englishman and the <unk> <unk> was forty thousand francs .
Dantès , struck with the beauty and <unk> of the little vessel , applied to its owner to <unk> it to him , offering sixty thousand francs , upon condition that he should be allowed to take immediate possession .
The proposal was too <unk> to be refused , the more so as the person for whom the yacht was intended had gone upon a tour through <unk> , and was not expected back in less than three weeks or a month , by which time the <unk> <unk> upon being able to complete another .
A <unk> was therefore struck .
Dantès led the owner of the yacht to the dwelling of a <unk> ; retired with the latter for a few minutes to a small back <unk> , and upon their return the <unk> counted out to the <unk> the sum of sixty thousand francs in bright gold pieces .
The delighted <unk> then offered his services in providing a suitable crew for the little vessel , but this Dantès declined with many thanks , saying he was accustomed to <unk> about quite alone , and his principal pleasure consisted in <unk> his yacht himself ; the only thing the <unk> could oblige him in would be to <unk> a sort of secret <unk> in the <unk> at his bed ’ s head , the <unk> to contain three <unk> , so constructed as to be concealed from all but himself .
The <unk> cheerfully <unk> the commission , and promised to have these secret places completed by the next day , Dantès <unk> the <unk> and plan in accordance with which they were to be constructed .
<unk> Two hours <unk> Dantès <unk> from the port of <unk> , under the <unk> of an immense crowd drawn together by curiosity to see the rich Spanish <unk> who preferred <unk> his own yacht .
But their wonder was soon changed to admiration at seeing the perfect skill with which Dantès <unk> the <unk> .
The boat , indeed , seemed to be animated with almost human intelligence , so <unk> did it obey the slightest touch ; and Dantès required but a short trial of his beautiful <unk> to acknowledge that the <unk> had not without reason attained their high reputation in the art of <unk> .
The spectators followed the little vessel with their eyes as long as it remained visible ; they then turned their conjectures upon her probable <unk> .
Some insisted she was making for Corsica , others the Island of Elba ; <unk> were offered to any amount that she was bound for Spain ; while <unk> was positively reported by many persons as her intended course ; but no one thought of Monte Cristo .
Yet thither it was that Dantès guided his vessel , and at Monte Cristo he arrived at the close of the second day ; his boat had proved herself a <unk> sailor , and had come the distance from <unk> in <unk> hours .
Dantès had carefully <unk> the general appearance of the shore , and , instead of landing at the usual place , he dropped anchor in the little <unk> .
The island was utterly deserted , and bore no evidence of having been visited since he went away ; his treasure was just as he had left it .
<unk> on the following morning he <unk> the <unk> of his riches , and ere nightfall the whole of his immense wealth was safely deposited in the <unk> of the secret <unk> .
A week passed by .
Dantès employed it in <unk> his yacht round the island , <unk> it as a skilful <unk> would the animal he destined for some important service , till at the end of that time he was perfectly <unk> with its good and bad qualities .
The former Dantès proposed to <unk> , the latter to remedy .
Upon the <unk> day he <unk> a small vessel under full sail approaching Monte Cristo .
As it drew near , he recognized it as the boat he had given to Jacopo .
He immediately <unk> it .
His signal was returned , and in two hours afterwards the <unk> lay at anchor beside the yacht .
A mournful answer awaited each of Edmond ’ s eager inquiries as to the information Jacopo had obtained .
Old Dantès was dead , and Mercédès had disappeared .
Dantès listened to these melancholy <unk> with <unk> calmness ; but , <unk> lightly <unk> , he signified his desire to be quite alone .
In a couple of hours he returned .
Two of the men from Jacopo ’ s boat came on board the yacht to assist in <unk> it , and he gave orders that she should be <unk> direct to Marseilles .
For his father ’ s death he was in some manner prepared ; but he knew not how to account for the mysterious disappearance of Mercédès .
Without <unk> his secret , Dantès could not give sufficiently clear instructions to an agent .
There were , besides , other particulars he was desirous of <unk> , and those were of a nature he alone could <unk> in a manner <unk> to himself .
His <unk> had assured him , during his stay at Leghorn , that he ran no risk of <unk> ; moreover , he had now the means of <unk> any disguise he thought proper .
One fine morning , then , his yacht , followed by the little <unk> , <unk> entered the port of Marseilles , and <unk> exactly opposite the spot from whence , on the <unk> night of his departure for the Château d ’ If , he had been put on board the boat destined to convey him thither .
<unk> Still Dantès could not view without a shudder the approach of a gendarme who accompanied the officers <unk> to demand his bill of health ere the yacht was permitted to hold communication with the shore ; but with that perfect <unk> he had acquired during his acquaintance with Faria , Dantès <unk> presented an English passport he had obtained from Leghorn , and as this gave him a standing which a French passport would not have afforded , he was informed that there existed no obstacle to his immediate <unk> .
The first person to attract the attention of Dantès , as he landed on the <unk> , was one of the crew belonging to the _ Pharaon _ .
Edmond welcomed the meeting with this fellow — who had been one of his own sailors — as a sure means of <unk> the extent of the change which time had worked in his own appearance .
<unk> straight towards him , he <unk> a variety of questions on different subjects , carefully watching the man ’ s countenance as he did so ; but not a word or look <unk> that he had the slightest idea of ever having seen before the person with whom he was then conversing .
<unk> the sailor a piece of money in return for his civility , Dantès proceeded <unk> ; but ere he had gone many steps he heard the man loudly calling him to stop .
Dantès instantly turned to meet him .
“ I beg your pardon , sir , ” said the honest fellow , in almost breathless haste , “ but I believe you made a mistake ; you intended to give me a <unk> piece , and see , you gave me a double Napoleon . ” “ Thank you , my good friend .
I see that I have made a trifling mistake , as you say ; but by way of <unk> your <unk> I give you another double Napoleon , that you may drink to my health , and be able to ask your <unk> to join you . ” So extreme was the surprise of the sailor , that he was unable even to thank Edmond , whose <unk> figure he continued to gaze after in <unk> astonishment .
“ Some <unk> from <unk> , ” was his <unk> .
Dantès , meanwhile , went on his way .
Each step he <unk> <unk> his heart with fresh emotion ; his first and most <unk> recollections were there ; not a tree , not a street , that he passed but seemed filled with dear and cherished memories .
And thus he proceeded <unk> till he arrived at the end of the Rue de <unk> , from whence a full view of the <unk> de <unk> was obtained .
At this spot , so <unk> with fond and <unk> <unk> , his heart beat almost to <unk> , his knees <unk> under him , a mist <unk> over his sight , and had he not clung for support to one of the trees , he would <unk> have fallen to the ground and been crushed beneath the many <unk> continually passing there .
<unk> himself , however , he wiped the perspiration from his <unk> , and stopped not again till he found himself at the door of the house in which his father had lived .
The <unk> and other plants , which his father had delighted to train before his window , had all disappeared from the upper part of the house .
<unk> against the tree , he gazed <unk> for a time at the upper stories of the <unk> little house .
Then he advanced to the door , and asked whether there were any rooms to be let .
Though answered in the <unk> , he begged so earnestly to be permitted to visit those on the fifth floor , that , in <unk> of the <unk> assurance of the _ concierge _ that they were occupied , Dantès succeeded in <unk> the man to go up to the <unk> , and ask permission for a gentleman to be allowed to look at them .
The <unk> of the humble <unk> were a young couple who had been scarcely married a week ; and seeing them , Dantès sighed heavily .
Nothing in the two small chambers forming the apartments remained as it had been in the time of the elder Dantès ; the very paper was different , while the <unk> of <unk> furniture with which the rooms had been filled in Edmond ’ s time had all disappeared ; the four walls alone remained as he had left them .
The bed belonging to the present <unk> was placed as the former owner of the chamber had been accustomed to have his ; and , in spite of his efforts to prevent it , the eyes of Edmond were <unk> in tears as he reflected that on that spot the old man had breathed his last , <unk> calling for his son .
The young couple gazed with astonishment at the sight of their visitor ’ s emotion , and wondered to see the large tears silently <unk> each other down his otherwise stern and <unk> features ; but they felt the <unk> of his grief , and kindly <unk> from <unk> him as to its cause , while , with <unk> delicacy , they left him to indulge his sorrow alone .
<unk> When he withdrew from the scene of his painful recollections , they both accompanied him downstairs , <unk> their hope that he would come again whenever he pleased , and <unk> him that their poor dwelling would ever be open to him .
As Edmond passed the door on the fourth floor , he paused to inquire whether Caderousse the <unk> still dwelt there ; but he received for reply , that the person in question had got into difficulties , and at the present time kept a small inn on the <unk> from <unk> to <unk> .
Having obtained the address of the person to whom the house in the <unk> de <unk> belonged , Dantès next proceeded thither , and , under the name of Lord Wilmore ( the name and title <unk> on his passport ) , purchased the small dwelling for the sum of twenty-five thousand francs , at least ten thousand more than it was worth ; but had its owner asked half a million , it would <unk> have been given .
The very same day the <unk> of the apartments on the fifth floor of the house , now become the property of Dantès , were <unk> informed by the notary who had arranged the necessary <unk> of deeds , etc . , that the new landlord gave them their choice of any of the rooms in the house , without the least <unk> of rent , upon condition of their giving instant possession of the two small chambers they at present inhabited .
This strange event aroused great wonder and curiosity in the neighborhood of the <unk> de <unk> , and a multitude of <unk> were <unk> , none of which was anywhere near the truth .
But what raised public astonishment to a <unk> , and set all conjecture at <unk> , was the knowledge that the same stranger who had in the morning visited the <unk> de <unk> had been seen in the evening walking in the little village of the Catalans , and afterwards observed to enter a poor <unk> ’ s hut , and to pass more than an hour in <unk> after persons who had either been dead or gone away for more than fifteen or sixteen years .
But on the following day the family from whom all these particulars had been asked received a handsome present , <unk> of an entirely new <unk> , with two <unk> and a tender .
The delighted <unk> of these <unk> <unk> would <unk> have poured out their thanks to their generous benefactor , but they had seen him , upon quitting the hut , merely give some orders to a sailor , and then <unk> lightly on horseback , leave Marseilles by the <unk> d ’ <unk> .
Chapter <unk> .
The Pont du <unk> <unk> Such of my <unk> as have made a <unk> <unk> to the south of France may <unk> have noticed , about <unk> between the town of <unk> and the village of <unk> , — a little nearer to the former than to the latter , — a small <unk> inn , from the front of which hung , <unk> and <unk> in the wind , a sheet of <unk> covered with a <unk> <unk> of the Pont du <unk> .
This modern place of <unk> stood on the <unk> side of the post road , and <unk> upon the <unk> .
It also <unk> of what in <unk> is <unk> a garden , <unk> of a small plot of ground , on the side opposite to the main entrance reserved for the reception of guests .
A few <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> struggled hard for existence , but their <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> proved how <unk> was the conflict .
Between these <unk> <unk> grew a <unk> supply of <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> ; while , <unk> and solitary , like a forgotten sentinel , a tall <unk> raised its melancholy head in one of the corners of this <unk> spot , and displayed its <unk> <unk> and <unk> summit dried and cracked by the fierce heat of the <unk> sun .
All these trees , great or small , were turned in the direction to which the <unk> blows , one of the three <unk> of <unk> , the others being the <unk> and the <unk> .
In the <unk> plain , which more resembled a <unk> lake than solid ground , were scattered a few miserable <unk> of <unk> , the effect , no doubt , of a curious desire on the part of the <unk> of the country to see whether such a thing as the raising of <unk> in those <unk> <unk> was <unk> .
Each <unk> served as a <unk> for a <unk> , which <unk> the passers-by through this <unk> scene with its <unk> , <unk> note .
For about seven or eight years the little tavern had been kept by a man and his wife , with two servants , — a <unk> named <unk> , and a <unk> called <unk> .
This small <unk> was quite equal to all the requirements , for a <unk> between <unk> and <unk> had <unk> <unk> by <unk> <unk> for the cart and the <unk> .
And , as though to add to the daily misery which this <unk> <unk> <unk> on the unfortunate innkeeper , whose utter ruin it was fast <unk> , it was situated between the <unk> from which it had its source and the <unk> it had <unk> , not a hundred steps from the inn , of which we have given a brief but faithful description .
The innkeeper himself was a man of from forty to <unk> years of age , tall , strong , and <unk> , a perfect <unk> of the <unk> of those <unk> <unk> ; he had dark , sparkling , and <unk> eyes , <unk> nose , and teeth white as those of a <unk> animal ; his hair , like his beard , which he wore under his chin , was thick and <unk> , and in spite of his age but slightly <unk> with a few <unk> <unk> .
His naturally dark complexion had assumed a still further shade of brown from the habit the unfortunate man had acquired of <unk> himself from morning till <unk> at the threshold of his door , on the <unk> for guests who seldom came , yet there he stood , day after day , exposed to the <unk> rays of a burning sun , with no other protection for his head than a red handkerchief <unk> around it , after the manner of the Spanish <unk> .
This man was our old acquaintance , <unk> Caderousse .
His wife , on the contrary , whose <unk> name had been Madeleine <unk> , was pale , <unk> , and <unk> .
<unk> in the neighborhood of <unk> , she had shared in the beauty for which its women are <unk> ; but that beauty had gradually <unk> beneath the <unk> influence of the slow fever so <unk> among <unk> by the <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> of <unk> .
She remained nearly always in her <unk> chamber , shivering in her chair , or stretched <unk> and feeble on her bed , while her husband kept his daily watch at the door — a duty he performed with so much the greater <unk> , as it saved him the necessity of listening to the <unk> <unk> and <unk> of his <unk> , who never saw him without breaking out into bitter <unk> against fate ; to all of which her husband would calmly return an <unk> reply , in these <unk> words : “ Hush , La Carconte .
It is God ’ s pleasure that things should be so . ” The <unk> of La Carconte had been bestowed on Madeleine <unk> from the fact that she had been born in a village , so called , situated between <unk> and <unk> ; and as a custom existed among the inhabitants of that part of France where Caderousse lived of <unk> every person by some particular and <unk> <unk> , her husband had bestowed on her the name of La Carconte in place of her sweet and <unk> name of Madeleine , which , in all probability , his rude <unk> language would not have enabled him to pronounce .
Still , let it not be supposed that amid this affected resignation to the will of Providence , the unfortunate innkeeper did not <unk> under the double misery of seeing the <unk> <unk> carry off his <unk> and his <unk> , and the daily <unk> of his <unk> partner ’ s <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> Like other <unk> in the south , he was a man of <unk> habits and <unk> desires , but fond of <unk> show , vain , and <unk> to display .
During the days of his prosperity , not a <unk> took place without himself and wife being among the spectators .
He dressed in the picturesque costume worn upon grand occasions by the inhabitants of the south of France , bearing equal resemblance to the style adopted both by the Catalans and <unk> ; while La Carconte displayed the charming fashion <unk> among the women of <unk> , a mode of <unk> <unk> equally from Greece and <unk> .
But , by degrees , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , embroidered <unk> , velvet <unk> , <unk> worked stockings , <unk> <unk> , and silver <unk> for the shoes , all disappeared ; and <unk> Caderousse , unable to appear abroad in his <unk> splendor , had given up any further <unk> in the <unk> and <unk> , both for himself and wife , although a bitter feeling of <unk> <unk> filled his mind as the sound of <unk> and merry music from the joyous <unk> reached even the miserable <unk> to which he still clung , more for the shelter than the profit it afforded .
Caderousse , then , was , as usual , at his place of observation before the door , his eyes glancing <unk> from a piece of closely <unk> grass — on which some <unk> were <unk> , though <unk> , endeavoring to turn up some <unk> or <unk> suited to their <unk> — to the deserted road , which led away to the north and south , when he was aroused by the <unk> voice of his wife , and <unk> to himself as he went , he mounted to her chamber , first taking care , however , to set the entrance door wide open , as an invitation to any chance traveller who might be passing .
At the moment Caderousse quitted his <unk> watch before the door , the road on which he so eagerly <unk> his sight was void and <unk> as a desert at midday .
There it lay <unk> out into one <unk> line of dust and sand , with its sides bordered by tall , <unk> trees , altogether presenting so <unk> an appearance , that no one in his senses could have imagined that any traveller , at liberty to <unk> his hours for <unk> , would choose to <unk> himself in such a formidable <unk> .
Nevertheless , had Caderousse but retained his post a few minutes longer , he might have caught a dim <unk> of something approaching from the direction of <unk> ; as the moving object drew nearer , he would easily have perceived that it consisted of a man and horse , between whom the <unk> and most amiable understanding appeared to exist .
The horse was of <unk> <unk> , and <unk> along at an easy pace .
His <unk> was a priest , dressed in black , and wearing a <unk> hat ; and , spite of the ardent rays of a <unk> sun , the pair came on with a fair degree of rapidity .
Having arrived before the Pont du <unk> , the horse stopped , but whether for his own pleasure or that of his <unk> would have been difficult to say .
However that might have been , the priest , <unk> , led his <unk> by the <unk> in search of some place to which he could secure him .
<unk> himself of a handle that projected from a <unk> door , he tied the animal safely and having drawn a red <unk> handkerchief , from his pocket , wiped away the perspiration that <unk> from his brow , then , advancing to the door , struck <unk> with the end of his <unk> stick .
At this unusual sound , a huge black dog came rushing to meet the daring <unk> of his <unk> tranquil abode , <unk> and displaying his sharp white teeth with a determined <unk> that <unk> proved how little he was accustomed to society .
At that moment a heavy <unk> was heard descending the wooden staircase that led from the upper floor , and , with many <unk> and <unk> smiles , the host of the Pont du <unk> <unk> his guest to enter .
<unk> “ You are welcome , sir , most welcome ! ” repeated the astonished Caderousse .
“ Now , then , <unk> , ” cried he , speaking to the dog , “ will you be quiet ?
Pray don ’ t heed him , sir ! — he only <unk> , he never <unk> .
I make no doubt a glass of good wine would be <unk> this dreadfully hot day . ” Then perceiving for the first time the <unk> of the traveller he had to entertain , Caderousse hastily exclaimed : “ A thousand <unk> !
I really did not observe whom I had the honor to receive under my poor roof .
What would the abbé please to have ?
What <unk> can I offer ?
All I have is at his service . ” The priest gazed on the person addressing him with a long and searching gaze — there even seemed a disposition on his part to court a similar <unk> on the part of the innkeeper ; then , observing in the countenance of the latter no other expression than extreme surprise at his own want of attention to an inquiry so <unk> <unk> , he <unk> it as well to <unk> this <unk> show , and therefore said , speaking with a strong Italian accent , “ You are , I presume , M. Caderousse ? ” “ Yes , sir , ” answered the host , even more surprised at the question than he had been by the silence which had preceded it ; “ I am <unk> Caderousse , at your service . ” “ <unk> Caderousse , ” <unk> the priest .
“ Yes , — Christian and <unk> are the same .
You formerly lived , I believe in the <unk> de <unk> , on the fourth floor ? ” <unk> “ I did . ” “ And you followed the business of a <unk> ? ” “ True , I was a <unk> , till the trade fell off .
It is so hot at Marseilles , that really I believe that the respectable inhabitants will in time go without any <unk> whatever .
But talking of heat , is there nothing I can offer you by way of <unk> ? ” “ Yes ; let me have a bottle of your best wine , and then , with your permission , we will <unk> our conversation from where we left off . ” “ As you please , sir , ” said Caderousse , who , anxious not to lose the present opportunity of finding a <unk> for one of the few bottles of <unk> still remaining in his possession , hastily raised a <unk> in the floor of the apartment they were in , which served both as <unk> and kitchen .
Upon <unk> forth from his subterranean retreat at the expiration of five minutes , he found the abbé seated upon a wooden <unk> , leaning his elbow on a table , while <unk> , whose <unk> seemed <unk> by the unusual command of the traveller for <unk> , had crept up to him , and had established himself very <unk> between his knees , his long , <unk> neck resting on his <unk> , while his dim eye was fixed earnestly on the traveller ’ s face .
“ Are you quite alone ? ” inquired the guest , as Caderousse placed before him the bottle of wine and a glass .
“ Quite , quite alone , ” replied the man — “ or , at least , <unk> so , for my poor wife , who is the only person in the house besides myself , is laid up with illness , and unable to render me the least assistance , poor thing ! ” “ You are married , then ? ” said the priest , with a show of interest , glancing round as he spoke at the <unk> <unk> of the apartment .
“ Ah , sir , ” said Caderousse with a sigh , “ it is easy to perceive I am not a rich man ; but in this world a man does not <unk> the better for being honest . ” The abbé fixed on him a searching , penetrating glance .
“ Yes , honest — I can certainly say that much for myself , ” continued the innkeeper , fairly <unk> the <unk> of the abbé ’ s gaze ; “ I can boast with truth of being an honest man ; and , ” continued he <unk> , with a hand on his breast and shaking his head , “ that is more than everyone can say nowadays . ” <unk> “ So much the better for you , if what you <unk> be true , ” said the abbé ; “ for I am firmly persuaded that , sooner or later , the good will be <unk> , and the wicked punished . ” “ Such words as those belong to your profession , ” answered Caderousse , “ and you do well to repeat them ; but , ” added he , with a bitter expression of countenance , “ one is free to believe them or not , as one pleases . ” “ You are wrong to speak thus , ” said the abbé ; “ and perhaps I may , in my own person , be able to prove to you how completely you are in error . ” “ What mean you ? ” inquired Caderousse with a look of surprise .
“ In the first place , I must be satisfied that you are the person I am in search of . ” “ What proofs do you require ? ” “ Did you , in the year <unk> or 1815 , know anything of a young sailor named Dantès ? ” “ Dantès ?
Did I know poor dear Edmond ?
Why , Edmond Dantès and myself were intimate friends ! ” exclaimed Caderousse , whose countenance <unk> <unk> as he caught the penetrating gaze of the abbé fixed on him , while the clear , calm eye of the <unk> seemed to <unk> with feverish <unk> .
“ You remind me , ” said the priest , “ that the young man concerning whom I asked you was said to bear the name of Edmond . ” “ <unk> to bear the name ! ” repeated Caderousse , becoming excited and eager .
“ Why , he was so called as truly as I myself bore the <unk> of <unk> Caderousse ; but tell me , I pray , what has become of poor Edmond ?
Did you know him ?
Is he alive and at liberty ?
Is he <unk> and happy ? ” “ He died a more wretched , <unk> , <unk> prisoner than the <unk> who pay the <unk> of their crimes at the galleys of Toulon . ” A deadly pallor followed the <unk> on the countenance of Caderousse , who turned away , and the priest saw him <unk> the tears from his eyes with the corner of the red handkerchief <unk> round his head .
“ Poor fellow , poor fellow ! ” murmured Caderousse .
“ Well , there , sir , is another proof that good people are never <unk> on this earth , and that none but the wicked <unk> .
Ah , ” continued Caderousse , speaking in the highly <unk> language of the South , “ the world grows worse and worse .
Why does not God , if he really <unk> the wicked , as he is said to do , send down <unk> and fire , and <unk> them altogether ? ” “ You speak as though you had loved this young Dantès , ” observed the abbé , without taking any notice of his companion ’ s <unk> .
“ And so I did , ” replied Caderousse ; “ though once , I confess , I <unk> him his good fortune .
But I swear to you , sir , I swear to you , by everything a man holds dear , I have , since then , deeply and sincerely <unk> his unhappy fate . ” There was a brief silence , during which the fixed , searching eye of the abbé was employed in <unk> the agitated features of the innkeeper .
“ You knew the poor lad , then ? ” continued Caderousse .
“ I was called to see him on his dying bed , that I might <unk> to him the <unk> of religion . ” “ And of what did he die ? ” asked Caderousse in a <unk> voice .
“ Of what , think you , do young and strong men die in prison , when they have scarcely <unk> their <unk> year , unless it be of <unk> ? ” Caderousse wiped away the large <unk> of perspiration that gathered on his brow .
<unk> “ But the <unk> part of the story is , ” resumed the abbé , “ that Dantès , even in his dying moments , <unk> by his <unk> <unk> , that he was utterly ignorant of the cause of his <unk> . ” “ And so he was , ” murmured Caderousse .
“ How should he have been otherwise ?
Ah , sir , the poor fellow told you the truth . ” “ And for that reason , he <unk> me to try and clear up a mystery he had never been able to penetrate , and to clear his memory should any foul spot or <unk> have fallen on it . ” And here the look of the abbé , becoming more and more fixed , seemed to rest with <unk> satisfaction on the gloomy <unk> which was rapidly <unk> over the countenance of Caderousse .
“ A rich Englishman , ” continued the abbé , “ who had been his companion in misfortune , but had been released from prison during the second <unk> , was possessed of a diamond of immense value ; this <unk> he bestowed on Dantès upon himself quitting the prison , as a mark of his gratitude for the kindness and <unk> care with which Dantès had <unk> him in a severe illness he <unk> during his <unk> .
<unk> of <unk> this diamond in <unk> to <unk> his <unk> , who might only have taken it and then betrayed him to the governor , Dantès carefully preserved it , that in the event of his getting out of prison he might have <unk> to live , for the <unk> of such a diamond would have quite sufficed to make his fortune . ” “ Then , I suppose , ” asked Caderousse , with eager , <unk> looks , “ that it was a stone of immense value ? ” “ Why , everything is relative , ” answered the abbé .
“ To one in Edmond ’ s position the diamond certainly was of great value .
It was <unk> at fifty thousand francs . ” “ <unk> me ! ” exclaimed Caderousse , “ fifty thousand francs !
<unk> the diamond was as large as a <unk> to be worth all that . ” “ No , ” replied the abbé , “ it was not of such a size as that ; but you shall judge for yourself .
I have it with me . ” The sharp gaze of Caderousse was instantly directed towards the priest ’ s garments , as though hoping to discover the <unk> of the treasure .
<unk> drawing forth from his pocket a small box covered with black <unk> , the abbé opened it , and displayed to the dazzled eyes of Caderousse the sparkling <unk> it contained , set in a ring of admirable <unk> .
“ And that diamond , ” cried Caderousse , almost breathless with eager admiration , “ you say , is worth fifty thousand francs ? ” “ It is , without the setting , which is also valuable , ” replied the abbé , as he closed the box , and returned it to his pocket , while its brilliant <unk> seemed still to dance before the eyes of the <unk> innkeeper .
“ But how comes the diamond in your possession , sir ?
Did Edmond make you his heir ? ” “ No , merely his <unk> <unk> .
‘ I once possessed four dear and faithful friends , besides the <unk> to whom I was betrothed ’ he said ; ‘ and I feel convinced they have all <unk> grieved over my loss .
The name of one of the four friends is Caderousse . ’ ” The innkeeper <unk> .
“ ‘ Another of the number , ’ ” continued the abbé , without seeming to notice the emotion of Caderousse , “ ‘ is called Danglars ; and the third , in spite of being my <unk> , entertained a very sincere affection for me . ’ ” A <unk> smile played over the features of Caderousse , who was about to break in upon the abbé ’ s speech , when the latter , <unk> his hand , said , “ <unk> me to finish first , and then if you have any <unk> to make , you can do so afterwards .
‘ The third of my friends , although my <unk> , was much attached to me , — his name was Fernand ; that of my betrothed was ’ — Stay , stay , ” continued the abbé , “ I have forgotten what he called her . ” “ Mercédès , ” said Caderousse eagerly .
“ True , ” said the abbé , with a stifled sigh , “ Mercédès it was . ” “ Go on , ” urged Caderousse .
“ <unk> me a _ <unk> _ of water , ” said the abbé .
Caderousse quickly performed the stranger ’ s <unk> ; and after <unk> some into a glass , and slowly <unk> its contents , the abbé , <unk> his usual <unk> of manner , said , as he placed his empty glass on the table : “ Where did we leave off ? ” “ The name of Edmond ’ s betrothed was Mercédès . ” “ To be sure .
‘ You will go to Marseilles , ’ said Dantès , — for you understand , I repeat his words just as he uttered them .
Do you understand ? ” “ <unk> . ” “ ‘ You will sell this diamond ; you will <unk> the money into five equal parts , and give an equal portion to these good friends , the only persons who have loved me upon earth . ’ ” “ But why into five parts ? ” asked Caderousse ; “ you only mentioned four persons . ” “ Because the fifth is dead , as I hear .
The fifth <unk> in Edmond ’ s <unk> , was his own father . ” “ <unk> true , too true ! ” ejaculated Caderousse , almost <unk> by the <unk> passions which <unk> him , “ the poor old man did die . ” “ I learned so much at Marseilles , ” replied the abbé , making a strong effort to appear indifferent ; “ but from the length of time that has elapsed since the death of the elder Dantès , I was unable to obtain any particulars of his end .
Can you <unk> me on that point ? ” “ I do not know who could if I could not , ” said Caderousse .
“ Why , I lived almost on the same floor with the poor old man .
Ah , yes , about a year after the disappearance of his son the poor old man died . ” “ Of what did he die ? ” “ Why , the <unk> called his complaint <unk> , I believe ; his <unk> say he died of grief ; but I , who saw him in his dying moments , I say he died of — — ” Caderousse paused .
“ Of what ? ” asked the priest , anxiously and eagerly .
“ Why , of <unk> <unk> . ” “ <unk> ! ” exclaimed the abbé , <unk> from his seat .
“ Why , the <unk> animals are not suffered to die by such a death as that .
The very dogs that <unk> <unk> and <unk> in the streets find some <unk> hand to cast them a <unk> of bread ; and that a man , a Christian , should be allowed to <unk> of hunger in the midst of other men who call themselves <unk> , is too horrible for belief .
Oh , it is impossible ! — utterly impossible ! ” “ What I have said , I have said , ” answered Caderousse .
“ And you are a fool for having said anything about it , ” said a voice from the top of the stairs .
“ Why should you <unk> with what does not concern you ? ” The two men turned quickly , and saw the <unk> countenance of La Carconte <unk> between the <unk> <unk> ; attracted by the sound of voices , she had <unk> dragged herself down the stairs , and , seated on the lower step , head on knees , she had listened to the <unk> conversation .
“ <unk> your own business , wife , ” replied Caderousse <unk> .
“ This gentleman <unk> me for information , which common politeness will not permit me to refuse . ” “ <unk> , you <unk> ! ” retorted La Carconte .
“ What have you to do with politeness , I should like to know ?
<unk> study a little common prudence .
How do you know the motives that person may have for trying to <unk> all he can from you ? ” “ I <unk> you my word , <unk> , ” said the abbé , “ that my intentions are good ; and that your husband can <unk> no risk , provided he <unk> me <unk> . ” “ Ah , that ’ s all very fine , ” retorted the woman .
“ Nothing is <unk> than to begin with fair promises and <unk> of nothing to fear ; but when poor , silly folks , like my husband there , have been persuaded to tell all they know , the promises and <unk> of safety are quickly forgotten ; and at some moment when nobody is expecting it , behold trouble and misery , and all sorts of <unk> , are <unk> on the unfortunate <unk> , who cannot even see whence all their <unk> come . ” “ Nay , nay , my good woman , make yourself perfectly easy , I beg of you .
Whatever evils may <unk> you , they will not be <unk> by my <unk> , that I solemnly promise you . ” La Carconte muttered a few <unk> words , then let her head again drop upon her knees , and went into a fit of <unk> , leaving the two <unk> to <unk> the conversation , but remaining so as to be able to hear every word they uttered .
Again the abbé had been obliged to <unk> a draught of water to calm the emotions that threatened to <unk> him .
When he had sufficiently recovered himself , he said , “ It appears , then , that the miserable old man you were telling me of was <unk> by everyone .
<unk> , had not such been the case , he would not have <unk> by so dreadful a death . ” “ Why , he was not altogether <unk> , ” continued Caderousse , “ for Mercédès the <unk> and Monsieur Morrel were very kind to him ; but somehow the poor old man had contracted a profound hatred for Fernand — the very person , ” added Caderousse with a bitter smile , “ that you named just now as being one of Dantès ’ faithful and attached friends . ” “ And was he not so ? ” asked the abbé .
“ <unk> , <unk> ! ” murmured the woman , from her seat on the stairs , “ mind what you are saying ! ” Caderousse made no reply to these words , though evidently irritated and <unk> by the <unk> , but , addressing the abbé , said , “ Can a man be faithful to another whose wife he <unk> and desires for himself ?
But Dantès was so honorable and true in his own nature , that he believed everybody ’ s <unk> of friendship .
Poor Edmond , he was <unk> deceived ; but it was fortunate that he never knew , or he might have found it more difficult , when on his <unk> , to pardon his enemies .
And , whatever people may say , ” continued Caderousse , in his native language , which was not altogether <unk> of rude <unk> , “ I cannot help being more frightened at the idea of the <unk> of the dead than the hatred of the living . ” “ <unk> ! ” exclaimed La Carconte .
“ Do you , then , know in what manner Fernand injured Dantès ? ” inquired the abbé of Caderousse .
“ Do I ?
No one better . ” “ Speak out then , say what it was ! ” “ <unk> ! ” cried La Carconte , “ do as you will ; you are master — but if you take my advice you ’ ll hold your tongue . ” “ Well , wife , ” replied Caderousse , “ I don ’ t know but what you ’ re right ! ” “ So you will say nothing ? ” asked the abbé .
“ Why , what good would it do ? ” asked Caderousse .
“ If the poor lad were living , and came to me and begged that I would <unk> tell which were his true and which his false friends , why , perhaps , I should not hesitate .
But you tell me he is no more , and therefore can have nothing to do with hatred or revenge , so let all such feeling be buried with him . ” “ You prefer , then , ” said the abbé , “ that I should bestow on men you say are false and <unk> , the <unk> intended for faithful friendship ? ” “ That is true enough , ” returned Caderousse .
“ You say truly , the gift of poor Edmond was not meant for such <unk> as Fernand and Danglars ; besides , what would it be to them ?
no more than a drop of water in the ocean . ” “ Remember , ” <unk> in La Carconte , “ those two could crush you at a single blow ! ” “ How so ? ” inquired the abbé .
“ Are these persons , then , so rich and powerful ? ” “ Do you not know their history ? ” “ I do not .
Pray relate it to me ! ” Caderousse seemed to reflect for a few moments , then said , “ No , truly , it would take up too much time . ” “ Well , my good friend , ” returned the abbé , in a tone that indicated utter indifference on his part , “ you are at liberty , either to speak or be silent , just as you please ; for my own part , I respect your scruples and admire your sentiments ; so let the matter end .
I shall do my duty as <unk> as I can , and fulfil my promise to the dying man .
My first business will be to <unk> of this diamond . ” So saying , the abbé again drew the small box from his pocket , opened it , and contrived to hold it in such a light , that a bright flash of brilliant <unk> passed before the dazzled gaze of Caderousse .
“ <unk> , wife ! ” cried he in a hoarse voice , “ come here ! ” “ <unk> ! ” exclaimed La Carconte , rising and descending to the chamber with a tolerably firm step ; “ what diamond are you talking about ? ” “ Why , did you not hear all we said ? ” inquired Caderousse .
“ It is a beautiful diamond left by poor Edmond Dantès , to be sold , and the money divided between his father , Mercédès , his betrothed bride , Fernand , Danglars , and myself .
The <unk> is worth at least fifty thousand francs . ” “ Oh , what a magnificent <unk> ! ” cried the astonished woman .
“ The fifth part of the <unk> from this stone belongs to us then , does it not ? ” asked Caderousse .
“ It does , ” replied the abbé ; “ with the addition of an equal division of that part intended for the elder Dantès , which I believe myself at liberty to <unk> equally with the four <unk> . ” “ And why among us four ? ” inquired Caderousse .
“ As being the friends Edmond <unk> most faithful and devoted to him . ” “ I don ’ t call those friends who betray and ruin you , ” murmured the wife in her turn , in a low , <unk> voice .
“ Of course not ! ” <unk> Caderousse quickly ; “ no more do I , and that was what I was observing to this gentleman just now .
I said I looked upon it as a <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> , perhaps crime . ” “ Remember , ” answered the abbé calmly , as he replaced the <unk> and its case in the pocket of his <unk> , “ it is your fault , not mine , that I do so .
You will have the goodness to furnish me with the address of both Fernand and Danglars , in order that I may <unk> Edmond ’ s last wishes . ” The agitation of Caderousse became extreme , and large drops of perspiration rolled from his <unk> brow .
As he saw the abbé rise from his seat and go towards the door , as though to ascertain if his horse were sufficiently <unk> to continue his journey , Caderousse and his wife exchanged looks of deep meaning .
<unk> “ There , you see , wife , ” said the former , “ this splendid diamond might all be ours , if we chose ! ” “ Do you believe it ? ” “ Why , surely a man of his holy profession would not deceive us ! ” “ Well , ” replied La Carconte , “ do as you like .
For my part , I <unk> my hands of the affair . ” So saying , she once more <unk> the staircase leading to her chamber , her body <unk> with <unk> , and her teeth <unk> in her head , in spite of the intense heat of the weather .
<unk> at the top <unk> , she turned round , and called out , in a warning tone , to her husband , “ <unk> , consider well what you are about to do ! ” “ I have both reflected and decided , ” answered he .
La Carconte then entered her chamber , the <unk> of which <unk> beneath her heavy , <unk> tread , as she proceeded towards her armchair , into which she fell as though exhausted .
“ Well , ” asked the abbé , as he returned to the apartment below , “ what have you made up your mind to do ? ” “ To tell you all I know , ” was the reply .
“ I certainly think you act <unk> in so doing , ” said the priest .
“ Not because I have the least desire to learn anything you may please to conceal from me , but simply that if , through your assistance , I could distribute the <unk> according to the wishes of the <unk> , why , so much the better , that is all . ” “ I hope it may be so , ” replied Caderousse , his face <unk> with <unk> .
“ I am all attention , ” said the abbé .
“ Stop a minute , ” answered Caderousse ; “ we might be interrupted in the most interesting part of my story , which would be a pity ; and it is as well that your visit hither should be made known only to ourselves . ” With these words he went <unk> to the door , which he closed , and , by way of still greater precaution , <unk> and barred it , as he was accustomed to do at night .
During this time the abbé had chosen his place for listening at his ease .
He removed his seat into a corner of the room , where he himself would be in deep shadow , while the light would be fully thrown on the <unk> ; then , with head bent down and hands clasped , or rather clenched together , he prepared to give his whole attention to Caderousse , who seated himself on the little <unk> , exactly opposite to him .
“ Remember , this is no affair of mine , ” said the trembling voice of La Carconte , as though through the <unk> of her chamber she viewed the scene that was <unk> below .
“ <unk> , enough ! ” replied Caderousse ; “ say no more about it ; I will take all the <unk> upon myself . ” And he began his story .
Chapter <unk> .
The <unk> First , sir , ” said Caderousse , “ you must make me a promise . ” “ What is that ? ” inquired the abbé .
“ Why , if you ever make use of the details I am about to give you , that you will never let anyone know that it was I who supplied them ; for the persons of whom I am about to talk are rich and powerful , and if they only laid the <unk> of their fingers on me , I should break to pieces like glass . ” “ Make yourself easy , my friend , ” replied the abbé .
“ I am a priest , and <unk> die in my breast .
<unk> , our only desire is to carry out , in a <unk> manner , the last wishes of our friend .
Speak , then , without reserve , as without hatred ; tell the truth , the whole truth ; I do not know , never may know , the persons of whom you are about to speak ; besides , I am an Italian , and not a Frenchman , and belong to God , and not to man , and I shall shortly retire to my convent , which I have only quitted to fulfil the last wishes of a dying man . ” This <unk> assurance seemed to give Caderousse a little courage .
“ Well , then , under these circumstances , ” said Caderousse , “ I will , I even believe I ought to <unk> you as to the friendship which poor Edmond thought so sincere and <unk> . ” “ <unk> with his father , if you please . ” said the abbé ; “ Edmond talked to me a great deal about the old man for whom he had the <unk> love . ” “ The history is a sad one , sir , ” said Caderousse , shaking his head ; “ perhaps you know all the earlier part of it ? ” “ Yes . ” answered the abbé ; “ Edmond related to me everything until the moment when he was arrested in a small <unk> close to Marseilles . ” “ At La <unk> !
Oh , yes ; I can see it all before me this moment . ” “ Was it not his <unk> feast ? ” “ It was and the feast that began so <unk> had a very sorrowful <unk> ; a police <unk> , followed by four soldiers , entered , and Dantès was arrested . ” “ Yes , and up to this point I know all , ” said the priest .
“ Dantès himself only knew that which <unk> concerned him , for he never beheld again the five persons I have named to you , or heard mention of anyone of them . ” “ Well , when Dantès was arrested , Monsieur Morrel hastened to obtain the particulars , and they were very sad .
The old man returned alone to his home , folded up his wedding suit with tears in his eyes , and <unk> up and down his chamber the whole day , and would not go to bed at all , for I was <unk> him and heard him walking the whole night ; and for myself , I assure you I could not sleep either , for the grief of the poor father gave me great uneasiness , and every step he took went to my heart as really as if his foot had pressed against my breast .
“ The next day Mercédès came to <unk> the protection of M. de Villefort ; she did not obtain it , however , and went to visit the old man ; when she saw him so miserable and <unk> , having passed a <unk> night , and not touched food since the previous day , she wished him to go with her that she might take care of him ; but the old man would not consent .
‘ No , ’ was the old man ’ s reply , ‘ I will not leave this house , for my poor dear boy loves me better than anything in the world ; and if he gets out of prison he will come and see me the first thing , and what would he think if I did not wait here for him ? ’ I heard all this from the window , for I was anxious that Mercédès should persuade the old man to accompany her , for his footsteps over my head night and day did not leave me a moment ’ s repose . ” “ But did you not go upstairs and try to console the poor old man ? ” asked the abbé .
“ Ah , sir , ” replied Caderousse , “ we cannot console those who will not be <unk> , and he was one of these ; besides , I know not why , but he seemed to dislike seeing me .
One night , however , I heard his sobs , and I could not resist my desire to go up to him , but when I reached his door he was no longer weeping but praying .
I cannot now repeat to you , sir , all the <unk> words and <unk> language he made use of ; it was more than <unk> , it was more than grief , and I , who am no <unk> , and hate the <unk> , said then to myself , ‘ It is really well , and I am very glad that I have not any children ; for if I were a father and felt such excessive grief as the old man does , and did not find in my memory or heart all he is now saying , I should throw myself into the sea at once , for I could not bear it . ’ ” “ Poor father ! ” murmured the priest .
“ From day to day he lived on alone , and more and more solitary .
M. Morrel and Mercédès came to see him , but his door was closed ; and , although I was certain he was at home , he would not make any answer .
One day , when , contrary to his custom , he had admitted Mercédès , and the poor girl , in spite of her own grief and despair , endeavored to console him , he said to her , — ‘ Be assured , my dear daughter , he is dead ; and instead of expecting him , it is he who is awaiting us ; I am quite happy , for I am the <unk> , and of course shall see him first . ’ “ However well disposed a person may be , why , you see we leave off after a time seeing persons who are in sorrow , they make one melancholy ; and so at last old Dantès was left all to himself , and I only saw from time to time strangers go up to him and come down again with some bundle they tried to hide ; but I guessed what these <unk> were , and that he sold by degrees what he had to pay for his <unk> .
At length the poor old fellow reached the end of all he had ; he owed three quarters ’ rent , and they threatened to turn him out ; he begged for another week , which was granted to him .
I know this , because the landlord came into my apartment when he left his .
“ For the first three days I heard him walking about as usual , but , on the fourth I heard nothing .
I then resolved to go up to him at all <unk> .
The door was closed , but I looked through the <unk> , and saw him so pale and haggard , that believing him very ill , I went and told M. Morrel and then ran on to Mercédès .
They both came immediately , M. Morrel bringing a doctor , and the doctor said it was <unk> of the <unk> , and ordered him a limited <unk> .
I was there , too , and I never shall forget the old man ’ s smile at this <unk> .
“ From that time he received all who came ; he had an excuse for not eating any more ; the doctor had put him on a <unk> . ” The abbé uttered a kind of groan .
“ The story interests you , does it not , sir ? ” inquired Caderousse .
“ Yes , ” replied the abbé , “ it is very <unk> . ” “ Mercédès came again , and she found him so altered that she was even more anxious than before to have him taken to her own home .
This was M. Morrel ’ s wish also , who would <unk> have conveyed the old man against his consent ; but the old man <unk> , and cried so that they were actually frightened .
Mercédès remained , therefore , by his <unk> , and M. Morrel went away , making a sign to the <unk> that he had left his purse on the chimney-piece ; but , <unk> himself of the doctor ’ s order , the old man would not take any <unk> ; at length ( after nine days of despair and <unk> ) , the old man died , <unk> those who had caused his misery , and saying to Mercédès , ‘ If you ever see my Edmond again , tell him I die blessing him . ’ ” The abbé rose from his chair , made two turns round the chamber , and pressed his trembling hand against his <unk> throat .
“ And you believe he died — — ” “ Of hunger , sir , of hunger , ” said Caderousse .
“ I am as certain of it as that we two are <unk> . ” The abbé , with a shaking hand , seized a glass of water that was standing by him <unk> , swallowed it at one <unk> , and then resumed his seat , with red eyes and pale cheeks .
“ This was , indeed , a horrid event , ” said he in a hoarse voice .
“ The more so , sir , as it was men ’ s and not God ’ s doing . ” “ Tell me of those men , ” said the abbé , “ and remember too , ” he added in an almost <unk> tone , “ you have promised to tell me everything .
Tell me , therefore , who are these men who killed the son with despair , and the father with <unk> ? ” “ Two men jealous of him , sir ; one from love , and the other from ambition , — Fernand and Danglars . ” “ How was this jealousy manifested ?
Speak on . ” “ They <unk> Edmond as a Bonapartist agent . ” “ Which of the two <unk> him ?
Which was the real <unk> ? ” “ Both , sir ; one with a letter , and the other put it in the post . ” “ And where was this letter written ? ” “ At La <unk> , the day before the <unk> feast . ” “ ’ <unk> so , then — ’ <unk> so , then , ” murmured the abbé .
“ Oh , Faria , Faria , how well did you judge men and things ! ” “ What did you please to say , sir ? ” asked Caderousse .
“ Nothing , nothing , ” replied the priest ; “ go on . ” “ It was Danglars who wrote the <unk> with his left hand , that his writing might not be recognized , and Fernand who put it in the post . ” “ But , ” exclaimed the abbé suddenly , “ you were there yourself . ” “ I ! ” said Caderousse , astonished ; “ who told you I was there ? ” The abbé saw he had <unk> the mark , and he added quickly , — “ No one ; but in order to have known everything so well , you must have been an <unk> . ” “ True , true ! ” said Caderousse in a <unk> voice , “ I was there . ” “ And did you not <unk> against such <unk> ? ” asked the abbé ; “ if not , you were an <unk> . ” “ Sir , ” replied Caderousse , “ they had made me drink to such an excess that I nearly lost all <unk> .
I had only an <unk> understanding of what was passing around me .
I said all that a man in such a state could say ; but they both assured me that it was a jest they were carrying on , and perfectly <unk> . ” “ <unk> day — next day , sir , you must have seen plain enough what they had been doing , yet you said nothing , though you were present when Dantès was arrested . ” “ Yes , sir , I was there , and very anxious to speak ; but Danglars restrained me .
‘ If he should really be guilty , ’ said he , ‘ and did really put in to the Island of Elba ; if he is really charged with a letter for the Bonapartist <unk> at Paris , and if they find this letter upon him , those who have supported him will pass for his <unk> . ’ I confess I had my fears , in the state in which politics then were , and I held my tongue .
It was <unk> , I confess , but it was not criminal . ” <unk> “ I understand — you allowed matters to take their course , that was all . ” “ Yes , sir , ” answered Caderousse ; “ and remorse <unk> on me night and day .
I often ask pardon of God , I swear to you , because this action , the only one with which I have seriously to reproach myself in all my life , is no doubt the cause of my <unk> condition .
I am <unk> a moment of selfishness , and so I always say to La Carconte , when she <unk> , ‘ Hold your tongue , woman ; it is the will of God . ’ ” And Caderousse bowed his head with every sign of real <unk> .
“ Well , sir , ” said the abbé , “ you have spoken <unk> ; and thus to <unk> yourself is to deserve pardon . ” “ <unk> , Edmond is dead , and has not <unk> me . ” “ He did not know , ” said the abbé .
“ But he knows it all now , ” interrupted Caderousse ; “ they say the dead know everything . ” There was a brief silence ; the abbé rose and <unk> up and down <unk> , and then resumed his seat .
“ You have two or three times mentioned a M. Morrel , ” he said ; “ who was he ? ” “ The owner of the _ Pharaon _ and patron of Dantès . ” “ And what part did he play in this sad drama ? ” inquired the abbé .
“ The part of an honest man , full of courage and real regard .
<unk> times he <unk> for Edmond .
When the emperor returned , he wrote , <unk> , threatened , and so <unk> , that on the second <unk> he was <unk> as a Bonapartist .
Ten times , as I told you , he came to see Dantès ’ father , and offered to receive him in his own house ; and the night or two before his death , as I have already said , he left his purse on the <unk> , with which they paid the old man ’ s debts , and buried him <unk> ; and so Edmond ’ s father died , as he had lived , without doing harm to anyone .
I have the purse still by me — a large one , made of red silk . ” “ And , ” asked the abbé , “ is M. Morrel still alive ? ” “ Yes , ” replied Caderousse .
“ In that case , ” replied the abbé , “ he should be a man blessed of God , rich , happy . ” Caderousse smiled bitterly .
“ Yes , happy as myself , ” said he .
“ What !
M. Morrel unhappy ? ” exclaimed the abbé .
“ He is reduced almost to the last extremity — nay , he is almost at the point of <unk> . ” “ How ? ” “ Yes , ” continued Caderousse , “ so it is ; after <unk> years of labor , after having acquired a most honorable name in the trade of Marseilles , M. Morrel is utterly ruined ; he has lost five <unk> in two years , has suffered by the <unk> of three large houses , and his only hope now is in that very _ Pharaon _ which poor Dantès commanded , and which is expected from the <unk> with a <unk> of <unk> and <unk> .
If this ship <unk> , like the others , he is a ruined man . ” “ And has the unfortunate man wife or children ? ” inquired the abbé .
“ Yes , he has a wife , who through everything has behaved like an angel ; he has a daughter , who was about to marry the man she loved , but whose family now will not allow him to <unk> the daughter of a ruined man ; he has , besides , a son , a <unk> in the army ; and , as you may suppose , all this , instead of <unk> , only <unk> his sorrows .
If he were alone in the world he would blow out his brains , and there would be an end . ” “ <unk> ! ” ejaculated the priest .
“ And it is thus heaven <unk> virtue , sir , ” added Caderousse .
“ You see , I , who never did a bad action but that I have told you of — am in <unk> , with my poor wife dying of fever before my very eyes , and I unable to do anything in the world for her ; I shall die of hunger , as old Dantès did , while Fernand and Danglars are rolling in wealth . ” “ How is that ? ” “ Because their deeds have brought them good fortune , while honest men have been reduced to misery . ” “ What has become of Danglars , the <unk> , and therefore the most guilty ? ” “ What has become of him ?
Why , he left Marseilles , and was taken , on the <unk> of M. Morrel , who did not know his crime , as <unk> into a Spanish bank .
During the war with Spain he was employed in the <unk> of the French army , and made a fortune ; then with that money he <unk> in the <unk> , and <unk> or <unk> his capital ; and , having first married his banker ’ s daughter , who left him a <unk> , he has married a second time , a widow , a Madame de <unk> , daughter of M. de <unk> , the king ’ s <unk> , who is in high favor at court .
He is a <unk> , and they have made him a baron , and now he is the Baron Danglars , with a fine residence in the Rue du <unk> , with ten horses in his <unk> , six <unk> in his antechamber , and I know not how many millions in his <unk> . ” “ Ah ! ” said the abbé , in a peculiar tone , “ he is happy . ” “ <unk> ?
Who can answer for that ?
<unk> or unhappiness is the secret known but to one ’ s self and the walls — walls have ears but no tongue ; but if a large fortune produces happiness , Danglars is happy . ” “ And Fernand ? ” “ Fernand ?
Why , much the same story . ” “ But how could a poor <unk> <unk> , without education or resources , make a fortune ?
I confess this <unk> me . ” “ And it has <unk> everybody .
There must have been in his life some strange secret that no one knows . ” “ But , then , by what visible steps has he attained this high fortune or high position ? ” “ Both , sir — he has both fortune and position — both . ” “ This must be impossible ! ” “ It would seem so ; but listen , and you will understand .
Some days before the return of the emperor , Fernand was <unk> .
The <unk> left him quietly enough at the Catalans , but Napoleon returned , a special <unk> was made , and Fernand was compelled to join .
I went too ; but as I was older than Fernand , and had just married my poor wife , I was only sent to the coast .
Fernand was <unk> in the active army , went to the <unk> with his regiment , and was at the battle of <unk> .
The night after that battle he was <unk> at the door of a general who carried on a secret <unk> with the enemy .
That same night the general was to go over to the English .
He proposed to Fernand to accompany him ; Fernand agreed to do so , deserted his post , and followed the general .
“ Fernand would have been <unk> if Napoleon had remained on the throne , but his action was <unk> by the <unk> .
He returned to France with the <unk> of <unk> , and as the protection of the general , who is in the highest favor , was <unk> to him , he was a captain in <unk> , during the Spanish war — that is to say , at the time when Danglars made his early <unk> .
Fernand was a <unk> , and being sent to Spain to ascertain the feeling of his <unk> , found Danglars there , got on very intimate terms with him , won over the support of the <unk> at the capital and in the <unk> , received promises and made <unk> on his own part , guided his regiment by paths known to himself alone through the mountain <unk> which were held by the <unk> , and , in fact , rendered such services in this brief <unk> that , after the taking of <unk> , he was made colonel , and received the title of count and the cross of an officer of the Legion of Honor . ” “ <unk> !
destiny ! ” murmured the abbé .
“ Yes , but listen : this was not all .
The war with Spain being ended , Fernand ’ s career was <unk> by the long peace which seemed likely to endure throughout Europe .
Greece only had risen against <unk> , and had begun her war of independence ; all eyes were turned towards <unk> — it was the fashion to pity and support the <unk> .
The French government , without <unk> them <unk> , as you know , gave countenance to <unk> assistance .
Fernand sought and obtained leave to go and serve in Greece , still having his name kept on the army roll .
<unk> Some time after , it was stated that the Comte de Morcerf ( this was the name he bore ) had entered the service of Ali <unk> with the rank of <unk> .
Ali <unk> was killed , as you know , but before he died he <unk> the services of Fernand by leaving him a considerable sum , with which he returned to France , when he was <unk> <unk> . ” “ So that now — — ? ” inquired the abbé .
“ So that now , ” continued Caderousse , “ he <unk> a magnificent house — No .
<unk> , Rue du <unk> , Paris . ” The abbé opened his mouth , hesitated for a moment , then , making an effort at <unk> , he said , “ And Mercédès — they tell me that she has disappeared ? ” “ <unk> , ” said Caderousse , “ yes , as the sun <unk> , to rise the next day with still more splendor . ” “ Has she made a fortune also ? ” inquired the abbé , with an <unk> smile .
“ Mercédès is at this moment one of the greatest ladies in Paris , ” replied Caderousse .
“ Go on , ” said the abbé ; “ it seems as if I were listening to the story of a dream .
But I have seen things so extraordinary , that what you tell me seems less astonishing than it otherwise might . ” “ Mercédès was at first in the <unk> despair at the blow which deprived her of Edmond .
I have told you of her attempts to <unk> M. de Villefort , her devotion to the elder Dantès .
In the midst of her despair , a new <unk> <unk> her .
This was the departure of Fernand — of Fernand , whose crime she did not know , and whom she regarded as her brother .
Fernand went , and Mercédès remained alone .
“ Three months passed and still she wept — no news of Edmond , no news of Fernand , no <unk> save that of an old man who was dying with despair .
One evening , after a day of accustomed <unk> at the angle of two roads leading to Marseilles from the Catalans , she returned to her home more <unk> than ever .
Suddenly she heard a step she knew , turned anxiously around , the door opened , and Fernand , dressed in the uniform of a <unk> , stood before her .
“ It was not the one she wished for most , but it seemed as if a part of her past life had returned to her .
“ Mercédès seized Fernand ’ s hands with a <unk> which he took for love , but which was only joy at being no longer alone in the world , and seeing at last a friend , after long hours of solitary sorrow .
And then , it must be confessed , Fernand had never been hated — he was only not precisely loved .
Another possessed all Mercédès ’ heart ; that other was absent , had disappeared , perhaps was dead .
At this last thought Mercédès burst into a <unk> of tears , and <unk> her hands in agony ; but the thought , which she had always <unk> before when it was suggested to her by another , came now in full force upon her mind ; and then , too , old Dantès incessantly said to her , ‘ Our Edmond is dead ; if he were not , he would return to us . ’ “ The old man died , as I have told you ; had he lived , Mercédès , <unk> , had not become the wife of another , for he would have been there to reproach her <unk> .
Fernand saw this , and when he learned of the old man ’ s death he returned .
He was now a <unk> .
At his first coming he had not said a word of love to Mercédès ; at the second he reminded her that he loved her .
“ Mercédès begged for six months more in which to await and <unk> for Edmond . ” “ So that , ” said the abbé , with a bitter smile , “ that makes eighteen months in all .
What more could the most devoted lover desire ? ” Then he murmured the words of the English poet , “ ‘ <unk> , thy name is woman . ’ ” “ Six months afterwards , ” continued Caderousse , “ the marriage took place in the church of <unk> . ” “ The very church in which she was to have married Edmond , ” murmured the priest ; “ there was only a change of <unk> . ” “ Well , Mercédès was married , ” proceeded Caderousse ; “ but although in the eyes of the world she appeared calm , she nearly fainted as she passed La <unk> , where , eighteen months before , the <unk> had been celebrated with him whom she might have known she still loved , had she looked to the bottom of her heart .
Fernand , more happy , but not more at his ease — for I saw at this time he was in constant dread of Edmond ’ s return — Fernand was very anxious to get his wife away , and to depart himself .
There were too many unpleasant <unk> associated with the Catalans , and eight days after the wedding they left Marseilles . ” “ Did you ever see Mercédès again ? ” inquired the priest .
“ Yes , during the Spanish war , at <unk> , where Fernand had left her ; she was attending to the education of her son . ” The abbé started .
“ Her son ? ” said he .
“ Yes , ” replied Caderousse , “ little Albert . ” “ But , then , to be able to <unk> her child , ” continued the abbé , “ she must have received an education herself .
I understood from Edmond that she was the daughter of a simple <unk> , beautiful but <unk> . ” “ Oh , ” replied Caderousse , “ did he know so little of his lovely betrothed ?
Mercédès might have been a <unk> , sir , if the crown were to be placed on the heads of the <unk> and most intelligent .
Fernand ’ s fortune was already <unk> great , and she <unk> with his growing fortune .
She learned drawing , music — everything .
Besides , I believe , between ourselves , she did this in order to <unk> her mind , that she might forget ; and she only filled her head in order to <unk> the weight on her heart .
But now her position in life is assured , ” continued Caderousse ; “ no doubt fortune and <unk> have <unk> her ; she is rich , a countess , and yet — — ” Caderousse paused .
“ And yet what ? ” asked the abbé .
“ Yet , I am sure , she is not happy , ” said Caderousse .
“ What makes you believe this ? ” “ Why , when I found myself utterly <unk> , I thought my old friends would , perhaps , assist me .
So I went to Danglars , who would not even receive me .
I called on Fernand , who sent me a hundred francs by his <unk> . ” “ Then you did not see either of them ? ” “ No , but Madame de Morcerf saw me . ” “ How was that ? ” “ As I went away a purse fell at my feet — it contained <unk> louis ; I raised my head quickly , and saw Mercédès , who at once shut the blind . ” “ And M. de Villefort ? ” asked the abbé .
“ Oh , he never was a friend of mine , I did not know him , and I had nothing to ask of him . ” “ Do you not know what became of him , and the share he had in Edmond ’ s misfortunes ? ” “ No ; I only know that some time after Edmond ’ s arrest , he married Mademoiselle de Saint-Méran , and soon after left Marseilles ; no doubt he has been as lucky as the rest ; no doubt he is as rich as Danglars , as high in station as Fernand .
I only , as you see , have remained poor , wretched , and forgotten . ” “ You are mistaken , my friend , ” replied the abbé ; “ God may seem sometimes to forget for a time , while his justice <unk> , but there always comes a moment when he <unk> — and behold — a proof ! ” As he spoke , the abbé took the diamond from his pocket , and giving it to Caderousse , said , “ Here , my friend , take this diamond , it is yours . ” “ What , for me only ? ” cried Caderousse , “ <unk> , sir , do not jest with me ! ” “ This diamond was to have been shared among his friends .
Edmond had one friend only , and thus it cannot be divided .
Take the diamond , then , and sell it ; it is worth fifty thousand francs , and I repeat my wish that this sum may suffice to <unk> you from your wretchedness . ” <unk> “ Oh , sir , ” said Caderousse , putting out one hand <unk> , and with the other <unk> away the perspiration which <unk> his brow , — “ Oh , sir , do not make a jest of the happiness or despair of a man . ” “ I know what happiness and what despair are , and I never make a jest of such feelings .
Take it , then , but in exchange — — ” Caderousse , who touched the diamond , withdrew his hand .
The abbé smiled .
“ In exchange , ” he continued , “ give me the red silk purse that M. Morrel left on old Dantès ’ chimney-piece , and which you tell me is still in your hands . ” Caderousse , more and more astonished , went toward a large <unk> cupboard , opened it , and gave the abbé a long purse of <unk> red silk , round which were two <unk> <unk> that had once been <unk> .
The abbé took it , and in return gave Caderousse the diamond .
“ Oh , you are a man of God , sir , ” cried Caderousse ; “ for no one knew that Edmond had given you this diamond , and you might have kept it . ” “ Which , ” said the abbé to himself , “ you would have done . ” The abbé rose , took his hat and gloves .
“ Well , ” he said , “ all you have told me is perfectly true , then , and I may believe it in every particular . ” “ See , sir , ” replied Caderousse , “ in this corner is a crucifix in holy wood — here on this <unk> is my wife ’ s <unk> ; open this book , and I will swear upon it with my hand on the crucifix .
I will swear to you by my soul ’ s <unk> , my faith as a Christian , I have told everything to you as it occurred , and as the <unk> angel will tell it to the ear of God at the day of the last judgment ! ” “ ’ Tis well , ” said the abbé , convinced by his manner and tone that Caderousse spoke the truth .
“ ’ Tis well , and may this money profit you !
Adieu ; I go far from men who thus so bitterly <unk> each other . ” The abbé with difficulty got away from the enthusiastic thanks of Caderousse , opened the door himself , got out and mounted his horse , once more <unk> the innkeeper , who kept uttering his loud <unk> , and then returned by the road he had travelled in coming .
When Caderousse turned around , he saw behind him La Carconte , <unk> and trembling more than ever .
“ Is , then , all that I have heard really true ? ” she inquired .
“ What ?
That he has given the diamond to us only ? ” inquired Caderousse , half bewildered with joy ; “ yes , nothing more true !
See , here it is . ” The woman gazed at it a moment , and then said , in a gloomy voice , “ <unk> it ’ s false ? ” Caderousse started and turned pale .
“ <unk> ! ” he muttered .
“ <unk> !
Why should that man give me a false diamond ? ” <unk> “ To get your secret without paying for it , you <unk> ! ” Caderousse remained for a moment <unk> under the weight of such an idea .
“ Oh ! ” he said , taking up his hat , which he placed on the red handkerchief tied round his head , “ we will soon find out . ” “ In what way ? ” “ Why , the fair is on at <unk> , there are always <unk> from Paris there , and I will show it to them .
Look after the house , wife , and I shall be back in two hours , ” and Caderousse left the house in haste , and ran rapidly in the direction opposite to that which the priest had taken .
“ <unk> thousand francs ! ” muttered La Carconte when left alone ; “ it is a large sum of money , but it is not a fortune . ” VOLUME TWO <unk> <unk> <unk> Chapter <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> The day after that in which the scene we have just described had taken place on the road between <unk> and <unk> , a man of about thirty or <unk> , dressed in a bright blue <unk> coat , <unk> trousers , and a white waistcoat , having the appearance and accent of an Englishman , presented himself before the mayor of Marseilles .
“ Sir , ” said he , “ I am chief clerk of the house of Thomson &amp; French , of Rome .
We are , and have been these ten years , connected with the house of Morrel &amp; <unk> , of Marseilles .
We have a hundred thousand francs or <unk> <unk> on their <unk> , and we are a little uneasy at reports that have reached us that the firm is on the brink of ruin .
I have come , therefore , express from Rome , to ask you for information . ” “ Sir , ” replied the mayor .
“ I know very well that during the last four or five years misfortune has seemed to pursue M. Morrel .
He has lost four or five <unk> , and suffered by three or four <unk> ; but it is not for me , although I am a <unk> myself to the amount of ten thousand francs , to give any information as to the state of his <unk> .
<unk> of me , as mayor , what is my opinion of M. Morrel , and I shall say that he is a man honorable to the last degree , and who has up to this time <unk> every engagement with <unk> <unk> .
This is all I can say , sir ; if you wish to learn more , address yourself to M. de Boville , the inspector of prisons , No .
<unk> , Rue de <unk> ; he has , I believe , two hundred thousand francs in Morrel ’ s hands , and if there be any grounds for apprehension , as this is a greater amount than mine , you will most probably find him better informed than myself . ” The Englishman seemed to <unk> this extreme delicacy , made his bow and went away , proceeding with a characteristic <unk> <unk> towards the street mentioned .
M. de Boville was in his private room , and the Englishman , on perceiving him , made a gesture of surprise , which seemed to indicate that it was not the first time he had been in his presence .
As to M. de Boville , he was in such a state of despair , that it was evident all the <unk> of his mind , absorbed in the thought which occupied him at the moment , did not allow either his memory or his imagination to <unk> to the past .
The Englishman , with the coolness of his nation , addressed him in terms nearly similar to those with which he had <unk> the mayor of Marseilles .
“ Oh , sir , ” exclaimed M. de Boville , “ your fears are unfortunately but too well <unk> , and you see before you a man in despair .
I had two hundred thousand francs placed in the hands of Morrel &amp; <unk> ; these two hundred thousand francs were the <unk> of my daughter , who was to be married in a fortnight , and these two hundred thousand francs were <unk> , half on the <unk> of this month , and the other half on the <unk> of next month .
I had informed M. Morrel of my desire to have these payments <unk> , and he has been here within the last <unk> to tell me that if his ship , the _ Pharaon _ , did not come into port on the <unk> , he would be wholly unable to make this <unk> . ” “ But , ” said the Englishman , “ this looks very much like a <unk> of <unk> . ” “ It looks more like <unk> ! ” exclaimed M. de Boville <unk> .
The Englishman appeared to reflect a moment , and then said , “ From which it would appear , sir , that this credit <unk> you with considerable apprehension ? ” “ To tell you the truth , I consider it lost . ” “ Well , then , I will buy it of you ! ” “ You ? ” “ Yes , I ! ” “ But at a tremendous <unk> , of course ? ” “ No , for two hundred thousand francs .
Our house , ” added the Englishman with a laugh , “ does not do things in that way . ” “ And you will pay — — ” “ <unk> money . ” <unk> And the Englishman drew from his pocket a bundle of bank-notes , which might have been twice the sum M. de Boville feared to lose .
A ray of joy passed across M. de Boville ’ s countenance , yet he made an effort at <unk> , and said : “ Sir , I ought to tell you that , in all probability , you will not realize six per <unk> of this sum . ” “ That ’ s no affair of mine , ” replied the Englishman , “ that is the affair of the house of Thomson &amp; French , in whose name I act .
They have , perhaps , some motive to serve in <unk> the ruin of a <unk> firm .
But all I know , sir , is , that I am ready to hand you over this sum in exchange for your <unk> of the debt .
I only ask a <unk> . ” “ Of course , that is perfectly just , ” cried M. de Boville .
“ The commission is usually one and a half ; will you have two — three — five per <unk> , or even more ?
Whatever you say . ” “ Sir , ” replied the Englishman , laughing , “ I am like my house , and do not do such things — no , the commission I ask is quite different . ” “ <unk> it , sir , I beg . ” “ You are the inspector of prisons ? ” “ I have been so these fourteen years . ” “ You keep the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> ? ” “ I do . ” “ To these <unk> there are added notes relative to the prisoners ? ” “ There are special reports on every prisoner . ” “ Well , sir , I was <unk> at Rome by a poor devil of an abbé , who disappeared suddenly .
I have since learned that he was confined in the Château d ’ If , and I should like to learn some particulars of his death . ” “ What was his name ? ” “ The Abbé Faria . ” “ Oh , I recollect him perfectly , ” cried M. de Boville ; “ he was <unk> . ” “ So they said . ” “ Oh , he was , decidedly . ” “ Very possibly ; but what sort of madness was it ? ” “ He pretended to know of an immense treasure , and offered vast <unk> to the government if they would <unk> him . ” “ Poor devil ! — and he is dead ? ” “ Yes , sir , five or six months ago , last February . ” “ You have a good memory , sir , to recollect <unk> so well . ” “ I recollect this , because the poor devil ’ s death was accompanied by a singular incident . ” “ May I ask what that was ? ” said the Englishman with an expression of curiosity , which a close <unk> would have been astonished at <unk> in his <unk> countenance .
“ Oh dear , yes , sir ; the abbé ’ s dungeon was forty or fifty feet distant from that of one of Bonaparte ’ s <unk> , — one of those who had <unk> the most to the return of the usurper in 1815 , a very resolute and very dangerous man . ” “ Indeed ! ” said the Englishman .
“ Yes , ” replied M. de Boville ; “ I myself had occasion to see this man in <unk> or <unk> , and we could only go into his dungeon with a file of soldiers .
That man made a deep impression on me ; I shall never forget his countenance ! ” <unk> The Englishman smiled <unk> .
“ And you say , sir , ” he <unk> , “ that the two <unk> — — ” “ Were separated by a distance of fifty feet ; but it appears that this Edmond Dantès — — ” “ This dangerous man ’ s name was — — ” “ Edmond Dantès .
It appears , sir , that this Edmond Dantès had procured tools , or made them , for they found a <unk> through which the prisoners held communication with one another . ” “ This <unk> was dug , no doubt , with an intention of escape ? ” “ No doubt ; but unfortunately for the prisoners , the Abbé Faria had an attack of <unk> , and died . ” “ That must have cut short the projects of escape . ” “ For the dead man , yes , ” replied M. de Boville , “ but not for the <unk> ; on the contrary , this Dantès saw a means of <unk> his escape .
He , no doubt , thought that prisoners who died in the Château d ’ If were <unk> in an ordinary <unk> , and he conveyed the dead man into his own cell , took his place in the <unk> in which they had <unk> up the corpse , and awaited the moment of <unk> . ” “ It was a bold step , and one that showed some courage , ” remarked the Englishman .
“ As I have already told you , sir , he was a very dangerous man ; and , fortunately , by his own act <unk> the government of the fears it had on his account . ” “ How was that ? ” “ How ?
Do you not comprehend ? ” “ No . ” “ The Château d ’ If has no cemetery , and they simply throw the dead into the sea , after <unk> a <unk> <unk> to their feet . ” “ Well ? ” observed the Englishman as if he were slow of <unk> .
“ Well , they fastened a <unk> ball to his feet , and threw him into the sea . ” “ Really ! ” exclaimed the Englishman .
“ Yes , sir , ” continued the inspector of prisons .
“ You may imagine the amazement of the <unk> when he found himself flung <unk> over the rocks !
I should like to have seen his face at that moment . ” “ That would have been difficult . ” “ No matter , ” replied De Boville , in supreme <unk> at the certainty of <unk> his two hundred thousand francs , — “ no matter , I can fancy it . ” And he shouted with laughter .
“ So can I , ” said the Englishman , and he laughed too ; but he laughed as the English do , “ at the end of his teeth . ” “ And so , ” continued the Englishman who first gained his composure , “ he was <unk> ? ” “ <unk> . ” “ So that the governor got rid of the dangerous and the <unk> prisoner at the same time ? ” “ <unk> . ” <unk> “ But some official <unk> was drawn up as to this affair , I suppose ? ” inquired the Englishman .
“ Yes , yes , the <unk> <unk> .
You understand , Dantès ’ relations , if he had any , might have some interest in knowing if he were dead or alive . ” “ So that now , if there were anything to <unk> from him , they may do so with easy conscience .
He is dead , and no mistake about it . ” “ Oh , yes ; and they may have the fact <unk> whenever they please . ” “ So be it , ” said the Englishman .
“ But to return to these <unk> . ” “ True , this story has <unk> our attention from them .
Excuse me . ” “ Excuse you for what ?
For the story ?
By no means ; it really seems to me very curious . ” “ Yes , indeed .
So , sir , you wish to see all relating to the poor abbé , who really was gentleness itself . ” “ Yes , you will much oblige me . ” “ Go into my study here , and I will show it to you . ” And they both entered M. de Boville ’ s study .
Everything was here arranged in perfect order ; each <unk> had its number , each file of papers its place .
The inspector begged the Englishman to seat himself in an armchair , and placed before him the <unk> and documents relative to the Château d ’ If , giving him all the time he desired for the examination , while De Boville seated himself in a corner , and began to read his <unk> .
The Englishman easily found the <unk> relative to the Abbé Faria ; but it seemed that the history which the inspector had related interested him greatly , for after having <unk> the first documents he turned over the leaves until he reached the <unk> respecting Edmond Dantès .
There he found everything arranged in due order , — the accusation , examination , Morrel ’ s <unk> , M. de Villefort ’ s <unk> notes .
He folded up the accusation quietly , and put it as quietly in his pocket ; read the examination , and saw that the name of Noirtier was not mentioned in it ; <unk> , too , the application <unk> <unk> April , 1815 , in which Morrel , by the deputy procureur ’ s advice , <unk> with the best intentions ( for Napoleon was then on the throne ) the services Dantès had rendered to the <unk> cause — services which Villefort ’ s <unk> rendered <unk> .
Then he saw through the whole thing .
This <unk> to Napoleon , kept back by Villefort , had become , under the second <unk> , a terrible weapon against him in the hands of the king ’ s attorney .
He was no longer astonished when he searched on to find in the <unk> this note , placed in a <unk> against his name : Edmond Dantès .
An <unk> Bonapartist ; took an active part in the return from the Island of Elba .
To be kept in strict solitary <unk> , and to be closely watched and guarded .
<unk> these lines was written in another hand : “ See note above — nothing can be done . ” He compared the writing in the <unk> with the writing of the <unk> placed beneath Morrel ’ s <unk> , and discovered that the note in the <unk> was the same writing as the <unk> — that is to say , was in Villefort ’ s <unk> .
<unk> As to the note which accompanied this , the Englishman understood that it might have been added by some inspector who had taken a momentary interest in Dantès ’ situation , but who had , from the remarks we have <unk> , found it impossible to give any effect to the interest he had felt .
As we have said , the inspector , from <unk> , and that he might not disturb the Abbé Faria ’ s <unk> in his <unk> , had seated himself in a corner , and was reading _ Le <unk> <unk> _ .
He did not see the Englishman fold up and place in his pocket the accusation written by Danglars under the <unk> of La <unk> , and which had the <unk> , “ Marseilles , <unk> February , <unk> 6 o ’ clock , <unk> ” But it must be said that if he had seen it , he attached so little importance to this <unk> of paper , and so much importance to his two hundred thousand francs , that he would not have opposed whatever the Englishman might do , however <unk> it might be .
“ Thanks , ” said the latter , closing the <unk> with a <unk> , “ I have all I want ; now it is for me to perform my promise .
Give me a simple <unk> of your debt ; acknowledge <unk> the receipt of the <unk> , and I will hand you over the money . ” He rose , gave his seat to M. de Boville , who took it without ceremony , and quickly drew up the required <unk> , while the Englishman counted out the bank-notes on the other side of the desk .
Chapter <unk> .
The House of Morrel &amp; <unk> <unk> who had quitted Marseilles a few years previously , well acquainted with the interior of Morrel ’ s <unk> , and had returned at this date , would have found a great change .
<unk> of that air of life , of comfort , and of happiness that <unk> a <unk> and <unk> business establishment — instead of merry faces at the windows , busy <unk> hurrying to and fro in the long <unk> — instead of the court filled with <unk> of <unk> , <unk> with the cries and the <unk> of <unk> , one would have immediately perceived all aspect of sadness and gloom .
<unk> of all the numerous <unk> that used to fill the deserted corridor and the empty office , but two remained .
One was a young man of three or <unk> , who was in love with M. Morrel ’ s daughter , and had remained with him in spite of the efforts of his friends to induce him to <unk> ; the other was an old <unk> <unk> , called “ Cocles , ” or “ <unk> , ” a <unk> given him by the young men who used to throng this vast now almost deserted <unk> , and which had so completely replaced his real name that he would not , in all probability , have replied to anyone who addressed him by it .
Cocles remained in M. Morrel ’ s service , and a most singular change had taken place in his position ; he had at the same time risen to the rank of <unk> , and sunk to the rank of a servant .
He was , however , the same Cocles , good , patient , devoted , but <unk> on the subject of <unk> , the only point on which he would have stood firm against the world , even against M. Morrel ; and strong in the <unk> , which he had at his fingers ’ ends , no matter what scheme or what trap was laid to catch him .
In the midst of the <unk> that <unk> the house , Cocles was the only one <unk> .
But this did not arise from a want of affection ; on the contrary , from a firm conviction .
Like the <unk> that one by one <unk> the <unk> ship even before the vessel <unk> anchor , so all the numerous <unk> had by degrees deserted the office and the <unk> .
Cocles had seen them go without thinking of <unk> the cause of their departure .
Everything was as we have said , a question of <unk> to Cocles , and during twenty years he had always seen all payments made with such <unk> , that it seemed as impossible to him that the house should stop <unk> , as it would to a <unk> that the river that had so long turned his <unk> should cease to flow .
Nothing had as yet occurred to shake Cocles ’ belief ; the last month ’ s <unk> had been made with the most <unk> <unk> ; Cocles had <unk> an <unk> of fourteen sous in his <unk> , and the same evening he had brought them to M. Morrel , who , with a melancholy smile , threw them into an almost empty drawer , saying : “ Thanks , Cocles ; you are the <unk> of <unk> . ” Cocles went away perfectly happy , for this <unk> of M. Morrel , himself the <unk> of the honest men of Marseilles , flattered him more than a present of fifty crowns .
But since the end of the month M. Morrel had passed many an anxious hour .
In order to meet the payments then due ; he had collected all his resources , and , fearing lest the report of his distress should get <unk> abroad at Marseilles when he was known to be reduced to such an extremity , he went to the <unk> fair to sell his wife ’ s and daughter ’ s jewels and a portion of his plate .
By this means the end of the month was passed , but his resources were now exhausted .
<unk> , owing to the reports <unk> , was no longer to be had ; and to meet the one hundred thousand francs due on the <unk> of the present month , and the one hundred thousand francs due on the <unk> of the next month to M. de Boville , M. Morrel had , in reality , no hope but the return of the _ Pharaon _ , of whose departure he had <unk> from a vessel which had weighed anchor at the same time , and which had already arrived in <unk> .
But this vessel which , like the _ Pharaon _ , came from <unk> , had been in for a fortnight , while no intelligence had been received of the _ Pharaon _ .
<unk> Such was the state of affairs when , the day after his interview with M. de Boville , the <unk> clerk of the house of Thomson &amp; French of Rome , presented himself at M. Morrel ’ s .
Emmanuel received him ; this young man was alarmed by the appearance of every new face , for every new face might be that of a new <unk> , come in anxiety to question the head of the house .
The young man , wishing to spare his <unk> the pain of this interview , questioned the <unk> ; but the stranger declared that he had nothing to say to M. Emmanuel , and that his business was with M. Morrel in person .
Emmanuel sighed , and summoned Cocles .
Cocles appeared , and the young man bade him conduct the stranger to M. Morrel ’ s apartment .
Cocles went first , and the stranger followed him .
On the staircase they met a beautiful girl of sixteen or seventeen , who looked with anxiety at the stranger .
“ M.
Morrel is in his room , is he not , Mademoiselle Julie ? ” said the <unk> .
“ Yes ; I think so , at least , ” said the young girl <unk> .
“ Go and see , Cocles , and if my father is there , announce this gentleman . ” “ It will be useless to announce me , mademoiselle , ” returned the Englishman .
“ M.
Morrel does not know my name ; this worthy gentleman has only to announce the <unk> clerk of the house of Thomson &amp; French of Rome , with whom your father does business . ” The young girl turned pale and continued to descend , while the stranger and Cocles continued to <unk> the staircase .
She entered the office where Emmanuel was , while Cocles , by the aid of a key he possessed , opened a door in the corner of a <unk> on the second staircase , conducted the stranger into an antechamber , opened a second door , which he closed behind him , and after having left the clerk of the house of Thomson &amp; French alone , returned and signed to him that he could enter .
The Englishman entered , and found Morrel seated at a table , turning over the formidable <unk> of his <unk> , which contained the list of his <unk> .
At the sight of the stranger , M. Morrel closed the <unk> , arose , and offered a seat to the stranger ; and when he had seen him seated , resumed his own chair .
<unk> years had changed the worthy merchant , who , in his <unk> year at the opening of this history , was now in his <unk> ; his hair had turned white , time and sorrow had <unk> deep <unk> on his brow , and his look , once so firm and penetrating , was now <unk> and wandering , as if he feared being forced to fix his attention on some particular thought or person .
The Englishman looked at him with an air of curiosity , evidently mingled with interest .
“ Monsieur , ” said Morrel , whose uneasiness was increased by this examination , “ you wish to speak to me ? ” “ Yes , monsieur ; you are aware from whom I come ? ” “ The house of Thomson &amp; French ; at least , so my <unk> tells me . ” “ He has told you rightly .
The house of Thomson &amp; French had <unk> or <unk> francs to pay this month in France ; and , knowing your strict <unk> , have collected all the <unk> bearing your signature , and charged me as they became due to present them , and to <unk> the money otherwise . ” Morrel sighed deeply , and passed his hand over his forehead , which was covered with perspiration .
“ So then , sir , ” said Morrel , “ you hold <unk> of mine ? ” “ Yes , and for a considerable sum . ” “ What is the amount ? ” asked Morrel with a voice he strove to render firm .
<unk> “ Here is , ” said the Englishman , taking a quantity of papers from his pocket , “ an <unk> of <unk> francs to our house by M. de Boville , the inspector of prisons , to whom they are due .
You acknowledge , of course , that you owe this sum to him ? ” “ Yes ; he placed the money in my hands at four and a half per <unk> nearly five years ago . ” “ When are you to pay ? ” “ Half the <unk> of this month , half the <unk> of next . ” “ Just so ; and now here are <unk> francs <unk> shortly ; they are all signed by you , and <unk> to our house by the <unk> . ” “ I recognize them , ” said Morrel , whose face was <unk> , as he thought that , for the first time in his life , he would be unable to honor his own signature .
“ Is this all ? ” “ No , I have for the end of the month these <unk> which have been <unk> to us by the house of <unk> , and the house of <unk> &amp; <unk> of Marseilles , <unk> to nearly <unk> francs ; in all , <unk> francs . ” It is impossible to describe what Morrel suffered during this <unk> .
“ Two hundred and <unk> thousand five hundred francs , ” repeated he .
“ Yes , sir , ” replied the Englishman .
“ I will not , ” continued he , after a moment ’ s silence , “ conceal from you , that while your <unk> and <unk> up to this moment are <unk> acknowledged , yet the report is current in Marseilles that you are not able to meet your <unk> . ” At this almost brutal speech Morrel turned <unk> pale .
“ Sir , ” said he , “ up to this time — and it is now more than <unk> years since I received the direction of this house from my father , who had himself conducted it for <unk> years — never has anything bearing the signature of Morrel &amp; <unk> been <unk> . ” “ I know that , ” replied the Englishman .
“ But as a man of honor should answer another , tell me fairly , shall you pay these with the same <unk> ? ” Morrel shuddered , and looked at the man , who spoke with more assurance than he had hitherto shown .
“ To questions <unk> put , ” said he , “ a <unk> answer should be given .
Yes , I shall pay , if , as I hope , my vessel arrives safely ; for its arrival will again procure me the credit which the numerous <unk> , of which I have been the victim , have deprived me ; but if the _ Pharaon _ should be lost , and this last resource be gone — — ” The poor man ’ s eyes filled with tears .
“ Well , ” said the other , “ if this last resource fail you ? ” “ Well , ” returned Morrel , “ it is a cruel thing to be forced to say , but , already used to misfortune , I must <unk> myself to shame .
I fear I shall be forced to <unk> <unk> . ” “ Have you no friends who could assist you ? ” Morrel smiled <unk> .
“ In business , sir , ” said he , “ one has no friends , only <unk> . ” “ It is true , ” murmured the Englishman ; “ then you have but one hope . ” “ But one . ” “ The last ? ” “ The last . ” “ So that if this fail — — ” “ I am ruined , — completely ruined ! ” “ As I was on my way here , a vessel was coming into port . ” “ I know it , sir ; a young man , who still <unk> to my fallen <unk> , passes a part of his time in a <unk> at the top of the house , in hopes of being the first to announce good news to me ; he has informed me of the arrival of this ship . ” “ And it is not yours ? ” “ No , she is a <unk> vessel , _ La <unk> _ ; she comes from <unk> also ; but she is not mine . ” “ Perhaps she has spoken to the _ Pharaon _ , and brings you some <unk> of her ? ” “ Shall I tell you plainly one thing , sir ?
I dread almost as much to receive any <unk> of my vessel as to remain in doubt .
<unk> is still hope . ” Then in a low voice Morrel added , — “ This delay is not natural .
The _ Pharaon _ left <unk> the 5th of February ; she ought to have been here a month ago . ” “ What is that ? ” said the Englishman .
“ What is the meaning of that noise ? ” “ Oh , my God ! ” cried Morrel , turning pale , “ what is it ? ” A loud noise was heard on the stairs of people moving hastily , and <unk> sobs .
Morrel rose and advanced to the door ; but his strength failed him and he sank into a chair .
The two men remained opposite one another , Morrel trembling in every <unk> , the stranger gazing at him with an air of profound pity .
The noise had ceased ; but it seemed that Morrel expected something — something had <unk> the noise , and something must follow .
The stranger fancied he heard footsteps on the stairs ; and that the footsteps , which were those of several persons , stopped at the door .
A key was <unk> in the lock of the first door , and the <unk> of hinges was audible .
“ There are only two persons who have the key to that door , ” murmured Morrel , “ Cocles and Julie . ” At this instant the second door opened , and the young girl , her eyes bathed with tears , appeared .
Morrel rose <unk> , <unk> himself by the arm of the chair .
He would have spoken , but his voice failed him .
“ Oh , father ! ” said she , <unk> her hands , “ forgive your child for being the <unk> of evil <unk> . ” Morrel again changed color .
Julie threw herself into his arms .
“ Oh , father , father ! ” murmured she , “ courage ! ” “ The _ Pharaon _ has gone down , then ? ” said Morrel in a hoarse voice .
The young girl did not speak ; but she made an <unk> sign with her head as she lay on her father ’ s breast .
“ And the crew ? ” asked Morrel .
“ <unk> , ” said the girl ; “ saved by the crew of the vessel that has just entered the <unk> . ” Morrel raised his two hands to heaven with an expression of resignation and sublime gratitude .
“ Thanks , my God , ” said he , “ at least thou <unk> but me alone . ” A tear <unk> the eye of the <unk> Englishman .
“ Come in , come in , ” said Morrel , “ for I presume you are all at the door . ” <unk> had he uttered those words when Madame Morrel entered weeping bitterly .
Emmanuel followed her , and in the antechamber were visible the rough faces of seven or eight <unk> sailors .
At the sight of these men the Englishman started and advanced a step ; then restrained himself , and retired into the <unk> and most obscure corner of the apartment .
Madame Morrel sat down by her husband and took one of his hands in hers , Julie still lay with her head on his shoulder , Emmanuel stood in the centre of the chamber and seemed to form the <unk> between Morrel ’ s family and the sailors at the door .
“ How did this happen ? ” said Morrel .
“ <unk> nearer , Penelon , ” said the young man , “ and tell us all about it . ” An old <unk> , <unk> by the <unk> sun , advanced , <unk> the remains of a hat between his hands .
“ <unk> , M. Morrel , ” said he , as if he had just quitted Marseilles the previous evening , and had just returned from <unk> or Toulon .
“ <unk> , Penelon , ” returned Morrel , who could not refrain from smiling through his tears , “ where is the captain ? ” “ The captain , M. Morrel , — he has <unk> behind sick at <unk> ; but please God , it won ’ t be much , and you will see him in a few days all alive and <unk> . ” “ Well , now tell your story , Penelon . ” <unk> Penelon rolled his <unk> in his cheek , placed his hand before his mouth , turned his head , and sent a long <unk> of <unk> into the antechamber , advanced his foot , <unk> himself , and began .
“ You see , M. Morrel , ” said he , “ we were somewhere between <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , <unk> with a fair breeze , <unk> after a week ’ s calm , when Captain <unk> comes up to me — I was at the <unk> I should tell you — and says , ‘ Penelon , what do you think of those clouds coming up over there ? ’ I was just then looking at them myself .
‘ What do I think , captain ?
Why I think that they are rising <unk> than they have any business to do , and that they would not be so black if they didn ’ t mean mischief . ’ — ‘ That ’ s my opinion too , ’ said the captain , ‘ and I ’ ll take precautions accordingly .
We are carrying too much canvas .
<unk> , there , all hands !
Take in the <unk> and <unk> the flying <unk> . ’ It was time ; the <unk> was on us , and the vessel began to <unk> .
‘ Ah , ’ said the captain , ‘ we have still too much canvas set ; all hands lower the <unk> ! ’ Five minutes after , it was down ; and we <unk> under <unk> and <unk> sails .
‘ Well , Penelon , ’ said the captain , ‘ what makes you shake your head ? ’ ‘ Why , ’ I says , ‘ I still think you ’ ve got too much on . ’ ‘ I think you ’ re right , ’ answered he , ‘ we shall have a <unk> . ’ ‘ A <unk> ?
More than that , we shall have a tempest , or I don ’ t know what ’ s what . ’ You could see the wind coming like the dust at <unk> ; <unk> the captain understood his business .
‘ Take in two <unk> in the <unk> , ’ cried the captain ; ‘ let go the <unk> ’ s , <unk> the <unk> , lower the <unk> sails , <unk> out the <unk> on the <unk> . ’ ” <unk> “ That was not enough for those <unk> , ” said the Englishman ; “ I should have taken four <unk> in the <unk> and <unk> the <unk> . ” His firm , <unk> , and unexpected voice made everyone start .
Penelon put his hand over his eyes , and then stared at the man who thus <unk> the <unk> of his captain .
“ We did better than that , sir , ” said the old sailor <unk> ; “ we put the <unk> up to run before the tempest ; ten minutes after we struck our <unk> and <unk> under bare <unk> . ” “ The vessel was very old to risk that , ” said the Englishman .
“ <unk> , it was that that did the business ; after <unk> heavily for twelve hours we sprung a <unk> .
‘ Penelon , ’ said the captain , ‘ I think we are sinking , give me the <unk> , and go down into the hold . ’ I gave him the <unk> , and descended ; there was already three feet of water .
‘ All hands to the <unk> ! ’ I shouted ; but it was too late , and it seemed the more we <unk> the more came in .
‘ Ah , ’ said I , after four hours ’ work , ‘ since we are sinking , let us sink ; we can die but once . ’ ‘ Is that the example you set , Penelon ? ’ cries the captain ; ‘ very well , wait a minute . ’ He went into his <unk> and came back with a <unk> of pistols .
‘ I will blow the brains out of the first man who leaves the <unk> , ’ said he . ” “ Well done ! ” said the Englishman .
<unk> “ There ’ s nothing gives you so much courage as good reasons , ” continued the sailor ; “ and during that time the wind had <unk> , and the sea gone down , but the water kept rising ; not much , only two inches an hour , but still it rose .
Two inches an hour does not seem much , but in twelve hours that makes two feet , and three we had before , that makes five .
‘ Come , ’ said the captain , ‘ we have done all in our power , and M. Morrel will have nothing to reproach us with , we have tried to save the ship , let us now save ourselves .
To the <unk> , my <unk> , as quick as you can . ’ Now , ” continued Penelon , “ you see , M. Morrel , a sailor is attached to his ship , but still more to his life , so we did not wait to be told twice ; the more so , that the ship was sinking under us , and seemed to say , ‘ <unk> along — save yourselves . ’ We soon <unk> the boat , and all eight of us got into it .
The captain descended last , or rather , he did not descend , he would not quit the vessel ; so I took him round the waist , and threw him into the boat , and then I jumped after him .
It was time , for just as I jumped the deck burst with a noise like the <unk> of a <unk> .
Ten minutes after she <unk> forward , then the other way , <unk> round and round , and then <unk> to the _ Pharaon _ .
As for us , we were three days without anything to eat or drink , so that we began to think of drawing <unk> who should <unk> the rest , when we saw _ La <unk> _ ; we made <unk> of distress , she perceived us , made for us , and took us all on board .
There now , M. Morrel , that ’ s the whole truth , on the honor of a sailor ; is not it true , you fellows there ? ” A general murmur of approbation showed that the <unk> had <unk> <unk> their misfortunes and sufferings .
“ Well , well , ” said M. Morrel , “ I know there was no one in fault but destiny .
It was the will of God that this should happen , blessed be his name .
What <unk> are due to you ? ” “ Oh , don ’ t let us talk of that , M. Morrel . ” “ Yes , but we will talk of it . ” “ Well , then , three months , ” said Penelon .
“ Cocles , pay two hundred francs to each of these good fellows , ” said Morrel .
“ At another time , ” added he , “ I should have said , Give them , besides , two hundred francs over as a present ; but times are changed , and the little money that remains to me is not my own , so do not think me mean on this account . ” Penelon turned to his companions , and exchanged a few words with them .
“ As for that , M. Morrel , ” said he , again turning his <unk> , “ as for that — — ” “ As for what ? ” “ The money . ” “ Well — — ” “ Well , we all say that fifty francs will be enough for us at present , and that we will wait for the rest . ” “ Thanks , my friends , thanks ! ” cried Morrel <unk> ; “ take it — take it ; and if you can find another <unk> , enter his service ; you are free to do so . ” These last words produced a prodigious effect on the <unk> .
Penelon nearly swallowed his <unk> ; fortunately he recovered .
“ What , M. Morrel ! ” said he in a low voice , “ you send us away ; you are then angry with us ! ” “ No , no , ” said M. Morrel , “ I am not angry , quite the contrary , and I do not send you away ; but I have no more <unk> , and therefore I do not want any sailors . ” “ No more <unk> ! ” returned Penelon ; “ well , then , you ’ ll <unk> some ; we ’ ll wait for you . ” “ I have no money to <unk> <unk> with , Penelon , ” said the poor owner <unk> , “ so I cannot accept your kind offer . ” “ No more money ?
Then you must not pay us ; we can <unk> , like the _ Pharaon _ , under bare <unk> . ” “ <unk> , enough ! ” cried Morrel , almost <unk> ; “ leave me , I pray you ; we shall meet again in a happier time .
Emmanuel , go with them , and see that my orders are executed . ” “ At least , we shall see each other again , M. Morrel ? ” asked Penelon .
“ Yes ; I hope so , at least .
Now go . ” He made a sign to Cocles , who went first ; the <unk> followed him and Emmanuel brought up the rear .
“ Now , ” said the owner to his wife and daughter , “ leave me ; I wish to speak with this gentleman . ” <unk> And he glanced towards the clerk of Thomson &amp; French , who had remained motionless in the corner during this scene , in which he had taken no part , except the few words we have mentioned .
The two women looked at this person whose presence they had entirely forgotten , and retired ; but , as she left the apartment , Julie gave the stranger a <unk> glance , to which he replied by a smile that an indifferent <unk> would have been surprised to see on his stern features .
The two men were left alone .
“ Well , sir , ” said Morrel , sinking into a chair , “ you have heard all , and I have nothing further to tell you . ” “ I see , ” returned the Englishman , “ that a fresh and <unk> misfortune has overwhelmed you , and this only <unk> my desire to serve you . ” “ Oh , sir ! ” cried Morrel .
“ Let me see , ” continued the stranger , “ I am one of your <unk> <unk> . ” “ Your <unk> , at least , are the first that will fall due . ” “ Do you wish for time to pay ? ” “ A delay would save my honor , and consequently my life . ” “ How long a delay do you wish for ? ” Morrel reflected .
“ Two months , ” said he .
“ I will give you three , ” replied the stranger .
“ But , ” asked Morrel , “ will the house of Thomson &amp; French consent ? ” “ Oh , I take everything on myself .
<unk> is the 5th of June . ” “ Yes . ” “ Well , <unk> these <unk> up to the 5th of September ; and on the 5th of September at eleven o ’ clock ( the hand of the clock pointed to eleven ) , I shall come to receive the money . ” “ I shall expect you , ” returned Morrel ; “ and I will pay you — or I shall be dead . ” These last words were uttered in so low a tone that the stranger could not hear them .
The <unk> were renewed , the old ones destroyed , and the poor <unk> found himself with three months before him to collect his resources .
The Englishman received his thanks with the <unk> peculiar to his nation ; and Morrel , <unk> him with grateful <unk> , conducted him to the staircase .
The stranger met Julie on the stairs ; she pretended to be descending , but in reality she was waiting for him .
“ Oh , sir ” — said she , <unk> her hands .
“ Mademoiselle , ” said the stranger , “ one day you will receive a letter signed ‘ Sinbad the <unk> . ’ Do exactly what the letter <unk> you , however strange it may appear . ” “ Yes , sir , ” returned Julie .
“ Do you promise ? ” “ I swear to you I will . ” “ It is well .
Adieu , mademoiselle .
<unk> to be the good , sweet girl you are at present , and I have great hopes that Heaven will <unk> you by giving you Emmanuel for a husband . ” Julie uttered a faint cry , <unk> like a rose , and leaned against the <unk> .
The stranger <unk> his hand , and continued to descend .
In the court he found Penelon , who , with a <unk> of a hundred francs in either hand , seemed unable to make up his mind to retain them .
“ Come with me , my friend , ” said the Englishman ; “ I wish to speak to you . ” Chapter 30 .
The <unk> of September The <unk> provided for by the agent of Thomson &amp; French , at the moment when Morrel expected it least , was to the poor <unk> so decided a stroke of good fortune that he almost dared to believe that fate was at length grown weary of <unk> her spite upon him .
The same day he told his wife , Emmanuel , and his daughter all that had occurred ; and a ray of hope , if not of tranquillity , returned to the family .
<unk> , however , Morrel had not only engagements with the house of Thomson &amp; French , who had shown themselves so <unk> towards him ; and , as he had said , in business he had <unk> , and not friends .
When he thought the matter over , he could by no means account for this generous conduct on the part of Thomson &amp; French towards him ; and could only <unk> it to some such selfish <unk> as this : “ We had better help a man who <unk> us nearly <unk> francs , and have those <unk> francs at the end of three months than hasten his ruin , and get only six or eight per <unk> of our money back again . ” <unk> , whether through envy or <unk> , all Morrel ’ s <unk> did not take this view ; and some even came to a contrary decision .
The <unk> signed by Morrel were presented at his office with <unk> <unk> , and , thanks to the delay granted by the Englishman , were paid by Cocles with equal <unk> .
Cocles thus remained in his accustomed tranquillity .
It was Morrel alone who remembered with alarm , that if he had to <unk> on the <unk> the <unk> francs of M. de Boville , and on the <unk> the <unk> francs of <unk> , for which , as well as the debt due to the inspector of prisons , he had time granted , he must be a ruined man .
The opinion of all the <unk> men was that , under the <unk> which had <unk> weighed down Morrel , it was impossible for him to remain <unk> .
Great , therefore , was the astonishment when at the end of the month , he <unk> all his <unk> with his usual <unk> .
Still confidence was not restored to all minds , and the general opinion was that the complete ruin of the unfortunate <unk> had been <unk> only until the end of the month .
The month passed , and Morrel made extraordinary efforts to get in all his resources .
<unk> his paper , at any date , was taken with confidence , and was even in request .
Morrel now tried to <unk> <unk> at <unk> days only , and none of the banks would give him credit .
Fortunately , Morrel had some <unk> coming in on which he could rely ; and , as they reached him , he found himself in a condition to meet his engagements when the end of July came .
The agent of Thomson &amp; French had not been again seen at Marseilles ; the day after , or two days after his visit to Morrel , he had disappeared ; and as in that city he had had no intercourse but with the mayor , the inspector of prisons , and M. Morrel , his departure left no trace except in the memories of these three persons .
As to the sailors of the _ Pharaon _ , they must have found <unk> <unk> elsewhere , for they also had disappeared .
Captain <unk> , recovered from his illness , had returned from <unk> .
He delayed presenting himself at Morrel ’ s , but the owner , hearing of his arrival , went to see him .
The worthy <unk> knew , from Penelon ’ s <unk> , of the captain ’ s brave conduct during the storm , and tried to console him .
He brought him also the amount of his <unk> , which Captain <unk> had not dared to apply for .
As he descended the staircase , Morrel met Penelon , who was going up .
Penelon had , it would seem , made good use of his money , for he was <unk> clad .
When he saw his <unk> , the worthy <unk> seemed much embarrassed , drew on one side into the corner of the <unk> , passed his <unk> from one cheek to the other , stared <unk> with his great eyes , and only acknowledged the <unk> of the hand which Morrel as usual gave him by a slight pressure in return .
Morrel attributed Penelon ’ s embarrassment to the elegance of his <unk> ; it was evident the good fellow had not gone to such an expense on his own account ; he was , no doubt , engaged on board some other vessel , and thus his <unk> arose from the fact of his not having , if we may so express ourselves , worn mourning for the _ Pharaon _ longer .
Perhaps he had come to tell Captain <unk> of his good luck , and to offer him employment from his new master .
“ <unk> fellows ! ” said Morrel , as he went away , “ may your new master love you as I loved you , and be more fortunate than I have been ! ” <unk> August rolled by in <unk> efforts on the part of Morrel to <unk> his credit or <unk> the old .
On the <unk> of August it was known at Marseilles that he had left town in the <unk> , and then it was said that the <unk> would go to protest at the end of the month , and that Morrel had gone away and left his chief clerk Emmanuel , and his <unk> Cocles , to meet the <unk> .
But , contrary to all expectation , when the <unk> of August came , the house opened as usual , and Cocles appeared behind the grating of the <unk> , examined all <unk> presented with the usual <unk> , and , from first to last , paid all with the usual <unk> .
There came in , moreover , two <unk> which M. Morrel had fully anticipated , and which Cocles paid as <unk> as the <unk> which the <unk> had accepted .
All this was <unk> , and then , with the <unk> peculiar to <unk> of bad news , the failure was put off until the end of September .
On the <unk> , Morrel returned ; he was awaited by his family with extreme anxiety , for from this journey to Paris they hoped great things .
Morrel had thought of Danglars , who was now <unk> rich , and had <unk> under great <unk> to Morrel in former days , since to him it was owing that Danglars entered the service of the Spanish banker , with whom he had laid the <unk> of his vast wealth .
It was said at this moment that Danglars was worth from six to eight millions of francs , and had <unk> credit .
Danglars , then , without taking a crown from his pocket , could save Morrel ; he had but to pass his word for a <unk> , and Morrel was saved .
Morrel had long thought of Danglars , but had kept away from some <unk> motive , and had delayed as long as possible <unk> himself of this last resource .
And Morrel was right , for he returned home crushed by the <unk> of a refusal .
Yet , on his arrival , Morrel did not utter a complaint , or say one harsh word .
He embraced his weeping wife and daughter , pressed Emmanuel ’ s hand with friendly warmth , and then going to his private room on the second floor had sent for Cocles .
“ Then , ” said the two women to Emmanuel , “ we are indeed ruined . ” It was agreed in a brief <unk> held among them , that Julie should write to her brother , who was in <unk> at <unk> , to come to them as speedily as possible .
The poor women felt instinctively that they required all their strength to support the blow that <unk> .
Besides , Maximilian Morrel , though hardly <unk> , had great influence over his father .
He was a <unk> , upright young man .
At the time when he decided on his profession his father had no desire to choose for him , but had consulted young Maximilian ’ s taste .
He had at once declared for a military life , and had in consequence studied hard , passed <unk> through the <unk> <unk> , and left it as <unk> of the <unk> of the line .
For a year he had held this rank , and expected <unk> on the first <unk> .
In his regiment Maximilian Morrel was <unk> for his <unk> <unk> , not only of the <unk> imposed on a soldier , but also of the duties of a man ; and he thus gained the name of “ the <unk> . ” We need hardly say that many of those who gave him this <unk> repeated it because they had heard it , and did not even know what it meant .
This was the young man whom his mother and sister called to their aid to <unk> them under the serious trial which they felt they would soon have to endure .
They had not mistaken the gravity of this event , for the moment after Morrel had entered his private office with Cocles , Julie saw the latter leave it pale , trembling , and his features <unk> the utmost <unk> .
She would have questioned him as he passed by her , but the worthy creature hastened down the staircase with unusual <unk> , and only raised his hands to heaven and exclaimed : “ Oh , mademoiselle , mademoiselle , what a dreadful misfortune !
Who could ever have believed it ! ” A moment afterwards Julie saw him go upstairs carrying two or three heavy <unk> , a <unk> , and a bag of money .
Morrel examined the <unk> , opened the <unk> , and counted the money .
All his <unk> <unk> to <unk> or <unk> francs , his <unk> <unk> up to the 5th to <unk> or <unk> , which , making the best of everything , gave him <unk> francs to meet debts <unk> to <unk> francs .
He had not even the means for making a possible <unk> on account .
However , when Morrel went down to his dinner , he appeared very calm .
This calmness was more alarming to the two women than the <unk> <unk> would have been .
After dinner Morrel usually went out and used to take his coffee at the club of the <unk> , and read the _ <unk> _ ; this day he did not leave the house , but returned to his office .
As to Cocles , he seemed completely bewildered .
For part of the day he went into the courtyard , seated himself on a stone with his head bare and exposed to the <unk> sun .
Emmanuel tried to comfort the women , but his <unk> <unk> .
The young man was too well acquainted with the business of the house , not to feel that a great catastrophe hung over the Morrel family .
Night came , the two women had watched , hoping that when he left his room Morrel would come to them , but they heard him pass before their door , and trying to conceal the noise of his footsteps .
They listened ; he went into his <unk> , and fastened the door inside .
Madame Morrel sent her daughter to bed , and half an hour after Julie had retired , she rose , took off her shoes , and went <unk> along the passage , to see through the <unk> what her husband was doing .
In the passage she saw a retreating shadow ; it was Julie , who , uneasy herself , had anticipated her mother .
The young lady went towards Madame Morrel .
“ He is writing , ” she said .
They had understood each other without speaking .
Madame Morrel looked again through the <unk> , Morrel was writing ; but Madame Morrel remarked , what her daughter had not observed , that her husband was writing on stamped paper .
The terrible idea that he was writing his will <unk> across her ; she shuddered , and yet had not strength to utter a word .
<unk> day M. Morrel seemed as calm as ever , went into his office as usual , came to his breakfast <unk> , and then , after dinner , he placed his daughter beside him , took her head in his arms , and held her for a long time against his bosom .
In the evening , Julie told her mother , that although he was apparently so calm , she had noticed that her father ’ s heart beat violently .
The next two days passed in much the same way .
On the evening of the <unk> of September , M. Morrel asked his daughter for the key of his study .
Julie trembled at this request , which seemed to her of bad <unk> .
Why did her father ask for this key which she always kept , and which was only taken from her in childhood as a punishment ?
The young girl looked at Morrel .
“ What have I done wrong , father , ” she said , “ that you should take this key from me ? ” “ Nothing , my dear , ” replied the unhappy man , the tears starting to his eyes at this simple question , — “ nothing , only I want it . ” Julie made a <unk> to feel for the key .
“ I must have left it in my room , ” she said .
And she went out , but instead of going to her apartment she hastened to consult Emmanuel .
“ Do not give this key to your father , ” said he , “ and tomorrow morning , if possible , do not quit him for a moment . ” She questioned Emmanuel , but he knew nothing , or would not say what he knew .
During the night , between the <unk> and 5th of September , Madame Morrel remained listening for every sound , and , until three o ’ clock in the morning , she heard her husband <unk> the room in great agitation .
It was three o ’ clock when he threw himself on the bed .
The mother and daughter passed the night together .
They had expected Maximilian since the previous evening .
At eight o ’ clock in the morning Morrel entered their chamber .
He was calm ; but the agitation of the night was <unk> in his pale and <unk> visage .
They did not dare to ask him how he had slept .
Morrel was <unk> to his wife , more affectionate to his daughter , than he had ever been .
He could not cease gazing at and <unk> the sweet girl .
Julie , <unk> of Emmanuel ’ s request , was following her father when he quitted the room , but he said to her quickly : “ <unk> with your mother , dearest . ” Julie wished to accompany him .
“ I wish you to do so , ” said he .
This was the first time Morrel had ever so spoken , but he said it in a tone of paternal kindness , and Julie did not dare to <unk> .
She remained at the same spot standing mute and motionless .
An instant afterwards the door opened , she felt two arms <unk> her , and a mouth pressed her forehead .
She looked up and uttered an exclamation of joy .
<unk> “ Maximilian , my dearest brother ! ” she cried .
At these words Madame Morrel rose , and threw herself into her son ’ s arms .
“ Mother , ” said the young man , looking <unk> at Madame Morrel and her daughter , “ what has occurred — what has happened ?
Your letter has frightened me , and I have come hither with all speed . ” “ Julie , ” said Madame Morrel , making a sign to the young man , “ go and tell your father that Maximilian has just arrived . ” The young lady rushed out of the apartment , but on the first step of the staircase she found a man holding a letter in his hand .
“ Are you not Mademoiselle Julie Morrel ? ” inquired the man , with a strong Italian accent .
“ Yes , sir , ” replied Julie with hesitation ; “ what is your pleasure ?
I do not know you . ” “ <unk> this letter , ” he said , <unk> it to her .
Julie hesitated .
“ It concerns the best interests of your father , ” said the messenger .
The young girl hastily took the letter from him .
She opened it quickly and read : “ Go this moment to the <unk> de <unk> , enter the house No .
<unk> , ask the porter for the key of the room on the fifth floor , enter the apartment , take from the corner of the <unk> a purse <unk> in red silk , and give it to your father .
It is important that he should receive it before eleven o ’ clock .
You promised to obey me <unk> .
Remember your oath .
“ Sinbad the <unk> . ” The young girl uttered a <unk> cry , raised her eyes , looked round to question the messenger , but he had disappeared .
She cast her eyes again over the note to <unk> it a second time , and saw there was a <unk> .
She read : “ It is important that you should fulfil this mission in person and alone .
If you go accompanied by any other person , or should anyone else go in your place , the porter will reply that he does not know anything about it . ” This <unk> <unk> greatly the young girl ’ s happiness .
Was there nothing to fear ?
was there not some <unk> laid for her ?
Her innocence had kept her in ignorance of the <unk> that might <unk> a young girl of her age .
But there is no need to know danger in order to fear it ; indeed , it may be observed , that it is usually unknown <unk> that inspire the greatest terror .
Julie hesitated , and resolved to take counsel .
Yet , through a singular impulse , it was neither to her mother nor her brother that she applied , but to Emmanuel .
She hastened down and told him what had occurred on the day when the agent of Thomson &amp; French had come to her father ’ s , related the scene on the staircase , repeated the promise she had made , and showed him the letter .
“ You must go , then , mademoiselle , ” said Emmanuel .
“ Go there ? ” murmured Julie .
“ Yes ; I will accompany you . ” “ But did you not read that I must be alone ? ” said Julie .
“ And you shall be alone , ” replied the young man .
“ I will await you at the corner of the Rue du <unk> , and if you are so long absent as to make me uneasy , I will hasten to <unk> you , and <unk> to him of whom you shall have cause to complain to me ! ” “ Then , Emmanuel ? ” said the young girl with hesitation , “ it is your opinion that I should obey this invitation ? ” “ Yes .
Did not the messenger say your father ’ s safety depended upon it ? ” “ But what danger <unk> him , then , Emmanuel ? ” she asked .
Emmanuel hesitated a moment , but his desire to make Julie decide immediately made him reply .
“ Listen , ” he said ; “ today is the 5th of September , is it not ? ” “ Yes . ” “ <unk> , then , at eleven o ’ clock , your father has nearly three hundred thousand francs to pay ? ” “ Yes , we know that . ” “ Well , then , ” continued Emmanuel , “ we have not fifteen thousand francs in the house . ” “ What will happen then ? ” “ Why , if today before eleven o ’ clock your father has not found someone who will come to his aid , he will be compelled at twelve o ’ clock to declare himself a <unk> . ” “ Oh , come , then , come ! ” cried she , <unk> away with the young man .
During this time , Madame Morrel had told her son everything .
The young man knew quite well that , after the succession of misfortunes which had <unk> his father , great changes had taken place in the style of living and <unk> ; but he did not know that matters had reached such a point .
He was <unk> .
Then , rushing hastily out of the apartment , he ran upstairs , expecting to find his father in his study , but he <unk> there in vain .
While he was yet at the door of the study he heard the bedroom door open , turned , and saw his father .
<unk> of going direct to his study , M. Morrel had returned to his <unk> , which he was only this moment quitting .
Morrel uttered a cry of surprise at the sight of his son , of whose arrival he was ignorant .
He remained motionless on the spot , pressing with his left hand something he had concealed under his coat .
Maximilian sprang down the staircase , and threw his arms round his father ’ s neck ; but suddenly he recoiled , and placed his right hand on Morrel ’ s breast .
“ Father , ” he exclaimed , turning pale as death , “ what are you going to do with that <unk> of pistols under your coat ? ” “ Oh , this is what I feared ! ” said Morrel .
“ Father , father , in Heaven ’ s name , ” exclaimed the young man , “ what are these weapons for ? ” “ Maximilian , ” replied Morrel , looking <unk> at his son , “ you are a man , and a man of honor .
Come , and I will explain to you . ” And with a firm step Morrel went up to his study , while Maximilian followed him , trembling as he went .
Morrel opened the door , and closed it behind his son ; then , crossing the <unk> , went to his desk on which he placed the pistols , and pointed with his finger to an open <unk> .
In this <unk> was made out an exact <unk> of his affairs .
Morrel had to pay , within half an hour , <unk> francs .
All he possessed was <unk> francs .
“ <unk> ! ” said Morrel .
The young man was overwhelmed as he read .
Morrel said not a word .
What could he say ?
What need he add to such a desperate proof in figures ?
“ And have you done all that is possible , father , to meet this <unk> result ? ” asked the young man , after a moment ’ s pause .
“ I have , ” replied Morrel .
“ You have no money coming in on which you can rely ? ” “ None . ” “ You have exhausted every resource ? ” “ All . ” “ And in half an hour , ” said Maximilian in a gloomy voice , “ our name is <unk> ! ” “ <unk> <unk> out <unk> , ” said Morrel .
“ You are right , father ; I understand you . ” Then extending his hand towards one of the pistols , he said , “ There is one for you and one for me — thanks ! ” Morrel caught his hand .
“ Your mother — your sister !
Who will support them ? ” A shudder ran through the young man ’ s frame .
“ Father , ” he said , “ do you reflect that you are <unk> me to live ? ” “ Yes , I do so <unk> you , ” answered Morrel , “ it is your duty .
You have a calm , strong mind , Maximilian .
Maximilian , you are no ordinary man .
I make no <unk> or <unk> ; I only ask you to examine my position as if it were your own , and then judge for yourself . ” The young man reflected for a moment , then an expression of sublime resignation appeared in his eyes , and with a slow and sad gesture he took off his two <unk> , the <unk> of his rank .
“ Be it so , then , my father , ” he said , extending his hand to Morrel , “ die in peace , my father ; I will live . ” Morrel was about to cast himself on his knees before his son , but Maximilian caught him in his arms , and those two noble hearts were pressed against each other for a moment .
“ You know it is not my fault , ” said Morrel .
<unk> Maximilian smiled .
“ I know , father , you are the most honorable man I have ever known . ” “ Good , my son .
And now there is no more to be said ; go and <unk> your mother and sister . ” “ My father , ” said the young man , bending his knee , “ bless me ! ” Morrel took the head of his son between his two hands , drew him forward , and <unk> his forehead several times said : “ Oh , yes , yes , I bless you in my own name , and in the name of three generations of <unk> men , who say through me , ‘ The <unk> which misfortune has destroyed , Providence may <unk> up again . ’ On seeing me die such a death , the most <unk> will have pity on you .
To you , perhaps , they will accord the time they have refused to me .
Then do your best to keep our name free from <unk> .
Go to work , labor , young man , struggle <unk> and <unk> ; live , yourself , your mother and sister , with the most <unk> <unk> , so that from day to day the property of those whom I leave in your hands may <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> how <unk> a day it will be , how grand , how solemn , that day of complete <unk> , on which you will say in this very office , ‘ My father died because he could not do what I have this day done ; but he died calmly and <unk> , because in dying he knew what I should do . ’ ” “ My father , my father ! ” cried the young man , “ why should you not live ? ” “ If I live , all would be changed ; if I live , interest would be converted into doubt , pity into <unk> ; if I live I am only a man who has broken his word , failed in his engagements — in fact , only a <unk> .
If , on the contrary , I die , remember , Maximilian , my corpse is that of an honest but unfortunate man .
<unk> , my best friends would avoid my house ; dead , all Marseilles will follow me in tears to my last home .
<unk> , you would feel shame at my name ; dead , you may raise your head and say , ‘ I am the son of him you killed , because , for the first time , he has been compelled to break his word . ’ ” The young man uttered a groan , but appeared resigned .
“ And now , ” said Morrel , “ leave me alone , and endeavor to keep your mother and sister away . ” “ Will you not see my sister once more ? ” asked Maximilian .
A last but final hope was concealed by the young man in the effect of this interview , and therefore he had suggested it .
Morrel shook his head .
“ I saw her this morning , and bade her adieu . ” “ Have you no particular <unk> to leave with me , my father ? ” inquired Maximilian in a <unk> voice .
“ Yes ; my son , and a sacred command . ” “ Say it , my father . ” “ The house of Thomson &amp; French is the only one who , from humanity , or , it may be , selfishness — it is not for me to read men ’ s hearts — has had any pity for me .
Its agent , who will in ten minutes present himself to receive the amount of a bill of <unk> francs , I will not say granted , but offered me three months .
Let this house be the first <unk> , my son , and respect this man . ” “ Father , I will , ” said Maximilian .
“ And now , once more , adieu , ” said Morrel .
“ Go , leave me ; I would be alone .
You will find my will in the <unk> in my bedroom . ” The young man remained standing and motionless , having but the force of will and not the power of execution .
“ <unk> me , Maximilian , ” said his father .
“ <unk> I were a soldier like you , and ordered to carry a certain redoubt , and you knew I must be killed in the <unk> , would you not say to me , as you said just now , ‘ Go , father ; for you are <unk> by delay , and death is <unk> to shame ! ’ ” “ Yes , yes , ” said the young man , “ yes ; ” and once again <unk> his father with <unk> pressure , he said , “ Be it so , my father . ” And he rushed out of the study .
When his son had left him , Morrel remained an instant standing with his eyes fixed on the door ; then putting forth his arm , he pulled the bell .
After a moment ’ s interval , Cocles appeared .
It was no longer the same man — the fearful <unk> of the three last days had crushed him .
This thought — the house of Morrel is about to stop <unk> — bent him to the earth more than twenty years would otherwise have done .
“ My worthy Cocles , ” said Morrel in a tone impossible to describe , “ do you remain in the antechamber .
When the gentleman who came three months ago — the agent of Thomson &amp; French — arrives , announce his arrival to me . ” Cocles made no reply ; he made a sign with his head , went into the <unk> , and seated himself .
Morrel fell back in his chair , his eyes fixed on the clock ; there were seven minutes left , that was all .
The hand moved on with incredible rapidity , he seemed to see its motion .
What passed in the mind of this man at the supreme moment of his agony cannot be told in words .
He was still <unk> young , he was surrounded by the loving care of a devoted family , but he had convinced himself by a course of reasoning , <unk> perhaps , yet certainly <unk> , that he must separate himself from all he held dear in the world , even life itself .
To form the slightest idea of his feelings , one must have seen his face with its expression of <unk> resignation and its <unk> eyes raised to heaven .
The minute hand moved on .
The pistols were loaded ; he stretched forth his hand , took one up , and murmured his daughter ’ s name .
Then he laid it down , seized his pen , and wrote a few words .
It seemed to him as if he had not taken a sufficient farewell of his beloved daughter .
Then he turned again to the clock , <unk> time now not by minutes , but by seconds .
He took up the deadly weapon again , his lips parted and his eyes fixed on the clock , and then shuddered at the <unk> of the <unk> as he <unk> the pistol .
At this moment of mortal anguish the cold <unk> came forth upon his brow , a <unk> stronger than death <unk> at his <unk> .
He heard the door of the staircase <unk> on its hinges — the clock gave its warning to strike eleven — the door of his study opened .
Morrel did not turn round — he expected these words of Cocles , “ The agent of Thomson &amp; French . ” He placed the <unk> of the pistol between his teeth .
Suddenly he heard a cry — it was his daughter ’ s voice .
He turned and saw Julie .
The pistol fell from his hands .
“ My father ! ” cried the young girl , out of breath , and half dead with joy — “ saved , you are saved ! ” And she threw herself into his arms , holding in her extended hand a red , <unk> silk purse .
<unk> “ <unk> , my child ! ” said Morrel ; “ what do you mean ? ” “ Yes , saved — saved !
See , see ! ” said the young girl .
Morrel took the purse , and started as he did so , for a vague remembrance reminded him that it once belonged to himself .
At one end was the <unk> bill for the <unk> francs , and at the other was a diamond as large as a <unk> , with these words on a small slip of <unk> : _ Julie ’ s <unk> _ .
Morrel passed his hand over his brow ; it seemed to him a dream .
At this moment the clock struck eleven .
He felt as if each stroke of the <unk> fell upon his heart .
“ <unk> , my child , ” he said , “ <unk> , my child , ” he said , “ explain — where did you find this purse ? ” “ In a house in the <unk> de <unk> , No .
<unk> , on the corner of a <unk> in a small room on the fifth floor . ” “ But , ” cried Morrel , “ this purse is not yours ! ” Julie handed to her father the letter she had received in the morning .
“ And did you go alone ? ” asked Morrel , after he had read it .
“ Emmanuel accompanied me , father .
He was to have waited for me at the corner of the Rue du <unk> , but , strange to say , he was not there when I returned . ” “ Monsieur Morrel ! ” exclaimed a voice on the stairs ; “ Monsieur Morrel ! ” “ It is his voice ! ” said Julie .
At this moment Emmanuel entered , his countenance full of animation and joy .
“ The _ Pharaon _ ! ” he cried ; “ the _ Pharaon _ ! ” “ What ! — what ! — the _ Pharaon _ !
Are you mad , Emmanuel ?
You know the vessel is lost . ” “ The _ Pharaon _ , sir — they signal the _ Pharaon _ !
The _ Pharaon _ is entering the <unk> ! ” Morrel fell back in his chair , his strength was <unk> him ; his understanding <unk> by such events , refused to comprehend such incredible , <unk> , <unk> facts .
But his son came in .
“ Father , ” cried Maximilian , “ how could you say the _ Pharaon _ was lost ?
The <unk> has <unk> her , and they say she is now coming into port . ” <unk> “ My dear friends , ” said Morrel , “ if this be so , it must be a miracle of heaven !
Impossible , impossible ! ” But what was real and not less incredible was the purse he held in his hand , the <unk> <unk> — the splendid diamond .
“ Ah , sir , ” exclaimed Cocles , “ what can it mean ? — the _ Pharaon _ ? ” “ Come , dear ones , ” said Morrel , rising from his seat , “ let us go and see , and Heaven have pity upon us if it be false intelligence ! ” They all went out , and on the stairs met Madame Morrel , who had been afraid to go up into the study .
In a moment they were at the <unk> .
There was a crowd on the <unk> .
All the crowd gave way before Morrel .
“ The _ Pharaon _ !
the _ Pharaon _ ! ” said every voice .
And , wonderful to see , in front of the tower of <unk> , was a ship bearing on her stern these words , printed in white letters , “ The _ Pharaon _ , Morrel &amp; <unk> , of Marseilles . ” She was the exact <unk> of the other _ Pharaon _ , and loaded , as that had been , with <unk> and <unk> .
She cast anchor , <unk> up sails , and on the deck was Captain <unk> giving orders , and good old Penelon making <unk> to M. Morrel .
To doubt any longer was impossible ; there was the evidence of the senses , and ten thousand persons who came to <unk> the <unk> .
As Morrel and his son embraced on the <unk> , in the presence and amid the <unk> of the whole city <unk> this event , a man , with his face <unk> by a black beard , and who , concealed behind the <unk> , watched the scene with delight , uttered these words in a low tone : “ Be happy , noble heart , be blessed for all the good thou <unk> done and <unk> do <unk> , and let my gratitude remain in obscurity like your good deeds . ” <unk> And with a smile expressive of supreme content , he left his <unk> , and without being observed , descended one of the <unk> of steps provided for <unk> , and <unk> three times , shouted “ Jacopo , Jacopo , Jacopo ! ” Then a <unk> came to shore , took him on board , and conveyed him to a yacht <unk> fitted up , on whose deck he sprung with the activity of a sailor ; thence he once again looked towards Morrel , who , weeping with joy , was shaking hands most <unk> with all the crowd around him , and <unk> with a look the unknown benefactor whom he seemed to be seeking in the <unk> .
“ And now , ” said the unknown , “ farewell kindness , humanity , and gratitude !
<unk> to all the feelings that <unk> the heart !
I have been Heaven ’ s <unk> to recompense the good — now the <unk> of vengeance <unk> to me his power to <unk> the wicked ! ” At these words he gave a signal , and , as if only awaiting this signal , the yacht instantly put out to sea .
Chapter <unk> .
Italy : Sinbad the <unk> Towards the beginning of the year <unk> , two young men belonging to the first society of Paris , the <unk> Albert de Morcerf and the Baron Franz d ’ Épinay , were at <unk> .
They had agreed to see the Carnival at Rome that year , and that Franz , who for the last three or four years had inhabited Italy , should act as _ <unk> _ to Albert .
As it is no <unk> affair to spend the Carnival at Rome , especially when you have no great desire to sleep on the Piazza del <unk> , or the <unk> <unk> , they wrote to Signor Pastrini , the <unk> of the Hôtel de <unk> , Piazza <unk> <unk> , to reserve comfortable apartments for them .
Signor Pastrini replied that he had only two rooms and a <unk> on the third floor , which he offered at the low charge of a louis per <unk> .
They accepted his offer ; but wishing to make the best use of the time that was left , Albert started for Naples .
As for Franz , he remained at <unk> , and after having passed a few days in <unk> the paradise of the <unk> , and <unk> two or three <unk> at the houses of the <unk> nobility , he took a fancy into his head ( having already visited Corsica , the <unk> of Bonaparte ) to visit Elba , the <unk> of Napoleon .
One evening he cast off the <unk> of a <unk> from the iron ring that secured it to the <unk> at Leghorn , wrapped himself in his coat and lay down , and said to the crew , — “ To the Island of Elba ! ” The boat shot out of the <unk> like a bird and the next morning Franz <unk> at <unk> .
He traversed the island , after having followed the traces which the footsteps of the <unk> have left , and <unk> for <unk> .
Two hours after he again landed at <unk> , where he was assured that red <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> was bad ; Franz only succeeded in <unk> a few <unk> , and , like every <unk> <unk> , he returned to the boat very much out of temper .
“ Ah , if your excellency chose , ” said the captain , “ you might have capital <unk> . ” “ Where ? ” “ Do you see that island ? ” continued the captain , pointing to a <unk> pile rising from the <unk> sea .
“ Well , what is this island ? ” “ The Island of Monte Cristo . ” “ But I have no permission to <unk> over this island . ” “ Your excellency does not require a permit , for the island is <unk> . ” “ Ah , indeed ! ” said the young man .
“ A desert island in the midst of the <unk> must be a curiosity . ” “ It is very natural ; this island is a mass of rocks , and does not contain an <unk> of land capable of <unk> . ” “ To whom does this island belong ? ” “ To <unk> . ” “ What game shall I find there ! ” “ <unk> of wild <unk> . ” “ Who live upon the stones , I suppose , ” said Franz with an <unk> smile .
“ No , but by <unk> the <unk> and trees that grow out of the <unk> of the rocks . ” “ Where can I sleep ? ” “ On shore in the <unk> , or on board in your cloak ; besides , if your excellency pleases , we can leave as soon as you like — we can sail as well by night as by day , and if the wind drops we can use our <unk> . ” As Franz had sufficient time , and his apartments at Rome were not yet available , he accepted the <unk> .
Upon his answer in the <unk> , the sailors exchanged a few words together in a low tone .
“ Well , ” asked he , “ what now ?
Is there any difficulty in the way ? ” “ No . ” replied the captain , “ but we must warn your excellency that the island is an <unk> port . ” “ What do you mean ? ” “ Monte Cristo although <unk> , yet <unk> occasionally as a refuge for the smugglers and <unk> who come from Corsica , <unk> , and <unk> , and if it becomes known that we have been there , we shall have to perform <unk> for six days on our return to Leghorn . ” “ The deuce !
That <unk> a different face on the matter .
Six days !
Why , that ’ s as long as the <unk> took to make the world !
<unk> long a wait — too long . ” “ But who will say your excellency has been to Monte Cristo ? ” “ Oh , I shall not , ” cried Franz .
“ Nor I , nor I , ” <unk> the sailors .
“ Then <unk> for Monte Cristo . ” The captain gave his orders , the <unk> was put up , and the boat was soon <unk> in the direction of the island .
Franz waited until all was in order , and when the sail was filled , and the four sailors had taken their places — three forward , and one at the <unk> — he resumed the conversation .
“ Gaetano , ” said he to the captain , “ you tell me Monte Cristo <unk> as a refuge for <unk> , who are , it seems to me , a very different kind of game from the <unk> . ” “ Yes , your excellency , and it is true . ” “ I knew there were smugglers , but I thought that since the <unk> of <unk> , and the destruction of the <unk> , <unk> existed only in the <unk> of <unk> and Captain <unk> . ” “ Your excellency is mistaken ; there are <unk> , like the bandits who were believed to have been <unk> by <unk> <unk> <unk> . , and who yet , every day , <unk> travellers at the gates of Rome .
Has not your excellency heard that the French _ <unk> d ’ <unk> _ was robbed six months ago within five hundred paces of <unk> ? ” “ Oh , yes , I heard that . ” “ Well , then , if , like us , your excellency lived at Leghorn , you would hear , from time to time , that a little merchant vessel , or an English yacht that was expected at <unk> , at <unk> , or at <unk> <unk> , has not arrived ; no one knows what has become of it , but , doubtless , it has struck on a rock and <unk> .
Now this rock it has met has been a long and narrow boat , <unk> by six or eight men , who have surprised and <unk> it , some dark and stormy night , near some desert and gloomy island , as bandits <unk> a carriage in the <unk> of a forest . ” “ But , ” asked Franz , who lay wrapped in his cloak at the bottom of the boat , “ why do not those who have been <unk> complain to the French , <unk> , or <unk> <unk> ? ” “ Why ? ” said Gaetano with a smile .
“ Yes , why ? ” “ Because , in the first place , they <unk> from the vessel to their own boat whatever they think worth taking , then they <unk> the crew hand and foot , they attach to everyone ’ s neck a <unk> ball , a large hole is <unk> in the vessel ’ s bottom , and then they leave her .
At the end of ten minutes the vessel begins to roll heavily and settle down .
First one gun ’ l goes under , then the other .
Then they lift and sink again , and both go under at once .
All at once there ’ s a noise like a cannon — that ’ s the air blowing up the deck .
Soon the water <unk> out of the <unk> like a <unk> <unk> , the vessel gives a last groan , <unk> round and round , and <unk> , forming a vast <unk> in the ocean , and then all is over , so that in five minutes nothing but the eye of God can see the vessel where she lies at the bottom of the sea .
Do you understand now , ” said the captain , “ why no <unk> are made to the government , and why the vessel never <unk> port ? ” It is probable that if Gaetano had related this previous to <unk> the <unk> , Franz would have hesitated , but now that they had started , he thought it would be <unk> to draw back .
He was one of those men who do not <unk> court danger , but if danger presents itself , combat it with the most <unk> coolness .
<unk> and resolute , he treated any peril as he would an <unk> in a duel , — calculated its probable method of approach ; retreated , if at all , as a point of <unk> and not from <unk> ; was quick to see an opening for attack , and won victory at a single thrust .
“ Bah ! ” said he , “ I have travelled through <unk> and <unk> — I have <unk> two months in the <unk> , and yet I never saw even the shadow of a bandit or a <unk> . ” “ I did not tell your excellency this to <unk> you from your project , ” replied Gaetano , “ but you questioned me , and I have answered ; that ’ s all . ” “ Yes , and your conversation is most interesting ; and as I wish to enjoy it as long as possible , <unk> for Monte Cristo . ” The wind blew strongly , the boat made six or seven <unk> an hour , and they were rapidly reaching the end of their voyage .
As they drew near the island seemed to lift from the sea , and the air was so clear that they could already distinguish the rocks <unk> on one another , like cannon balls in an <unk> , with green <unk> and trees growing in the <unk> .
As for the sailors , although they appeared perfectly tranquil yet it was evident that they were on the <unk> , and that they carefully watched the <unk> surface over which they were <unk> , and on which a few <unk> , with their white sails , were alone visible .
They were within fifteen miles of Monte Cristo when the sun began to set behind Corsica , whose mountains appeared against the sky , showing their <unk> <unk> in bold relief ; this mass of rock , like the <unk> <unk> , rose dead <unk> , a formidable barrier , and <unk> the light that gilded its <unk> <unk> so that the <unk> were in shadow .
Little by little the shadow rose higher and seemed to drive before it the last rays of the <unk> day ; at last the reflection rested on the summit of the mountain , where it paused an instant , like the <unk> crest of a <unk> , then gloom gradually covered the summit as it had covered the base , and the island now only appeared to be a gray mountain that grew continually <unk> ; half an hour after , the night was quite dark .
Fortunately , the <unk> were used to these <unk> , and knew every rock in the <unk> <unk> ; for in the midst of this obscurity Franz was not without uneasiness — Corsica had long since disappeared , and Monte Cristo itself was invisible ; but the sailors seemed , like the <unk> , to see in the dark , and the <unk> who <unk> did not <unk> the slightest hesitation .
An hour had passed since the sun had set , when Franz fancied he saw , at a quarter of a mile to the left , a dark mass , but he could not precisely make out what it was , and fearing to excite the <unk> of the sailors by <unk> a floating cloud for land , he remained silent ; suddenly a great light appeared on the <unk> ; land might resemble a cloud , but the fire was not a <unk> .
“ What is this light ? ” asked he .
“ Hush ! ” said the captain ; “ it is a fire . ” “ But you told me the island was <unk> ? ” “ I said there were no fixed <unk> on it , but I said also that it served sometimes as a <unk> for smugglers . ” “ And for <unk> ? ” “ And for <unk> , ” returned Gaetano , <unk> Franz ’ s words .
“ It is for that reason I have given orders to pass the island , for , as you see , the fire is behind us . ” “ But this fire ? ” continued Franz .
“ It seems to me rather <unk> than otherwise ; men who did not wish to be seen would not light a fire . ” “ Oh , that goes for nothing , ” said Gaetano .
“ If you can guess the position of the island in the darkness , you will see that the fire cannot be seen from the side or from <unk> , but only from the sea . ” “ You think , then , this fire <unk> the presence of unpleasant neighbors ? ” “ That is what we must find out , ” returned Gaetano , fixing his eyes on this <unk> star .
“ How can you find out ? ” “ You shall see . ” Gaetano consulted with his companions , and after five minutes ’ discussion a <unk> was executed which caused the vessel to <unk> about , they returned the way they had come , and in a few minutes the fire disappeared , hidden by an <unk> of the land .
The <unk> again changed the course of the boat , which rapidly approached the island , and was soon within fifty paces of it .
Gaetano lowered the sail , and the boat came to rest .
All this was done in silence , and from the moment that their course was changed not a word was spoken .
Gaetano , who had proposed the <unk> , had taken all the <unk> on himself ; the four sailors fixed their eyes on him , while they got out their <unk> and held themselves in readiness to <unk> away , which , thanks to the darkness , would not be difficult .
As for Franz , he examined his arms with the utmost coolness ; he had two <unk> guns and a <unk> ; he loaded them , looked at the <unk> , and waited quietly .
During this time the captain had thrown off his <unk> and shirt , and secured his trousers round his waist ; his feet were naked , so he had no shoes and stockings to take off ; after these <unk> he placed his finger on his lips , and <unk> himself <unk> into the sea , <unk> towards the shore with such precaution that it was impossible to hear the slightest sound ; he could only be traced by the <unk> line in his wake .
This track soon disappeared ; it was evident that he had touched the shore .
<unk> on board remained motionless for half an hour , when the same luminous track was again observed , and the <unk> was soon on board .
“ Well ? ” exclaimed Franz and the sailors in <unk> .
“ They are Spanish smugglers , ” said he ; “ they have with them two Corsican bandits . ” “ And what are these Corsican bandits doing here with Spanish smugglers ? ” “ Alas , ” returned the captain with an accent of the most profound pity , “ we ought always to help one another .
Very often the bandits are hard pressed by gendarmes or <unk> ; well , they see a vessel , and good fellows like us on board , they come and demand hospitality of us ; you can ’ t refuse help to a poor hunted devil ; we receive them , and for greater security we stand out to sea .
This costs us nothing , and <unk> the life , or at least the liberty , of a <unk> , who on the first occasion returns the service by pointing out some safe spot where we can land our <unk> without <unk> . ” “ Ah ! ” said Franz , “ then you are a <unk> occasionally , Gaetano ? ” “ Your excellency , we must live somehow , ” returned the other , smiling <unk> .
“ Then you know the men who are now on Monte Cristo ? ” “ Oh , yes , we sailors are like <unk> , and recognize each other by signs . ” “ And do you think we have nothing to fear if we land ? ” “ Nothing at all ; smugglers are not thieves . ” “ But these two Corsican bandits ? ” said Franz , <unk> the chances of peril .
“ It is not their fault that they are bandits , but that of the authorities . ” “ How so ? ” “ Because they are pursued for having made a stiff , as if it was not in a Corsican ’ s nature to revenge himself . ” “ What do you mean by having made a stiff ? — having assassinated a man ? ” said Franz , <unk> his <unk> .
“ I mean that they have killed an enemy , which is a very different thing , ” returned the captain .
“ Well , ” said the young man , “ let us demand hospitality of these smugglers and bandits .
Do you think they will grant it ? ” “ Without doubt . ” “ How many are they ? ” “ Four , and the two bandits make six . ” “ Just our number , so that if they prove troublesome , we shall be able to hold them in check ; so , for the last time , <unk> to Monte Cristo . ” “ Yes , but your excellency will permit us to take all due precautions . ” “ By all means , be as wise as <unk> and as prudent as <unk> ; I do more than permit , I <unk> you . ” “ Silence , then ! ” said Gaetano .
<unk> obeyed .
For a man who , like Franz , viewed his position in its true light , it was a grave one .
He was alone in the darkness with sailors whom he did not know , and who had no reason to be devoted to him ; who knew that he had several thousand francs in his <unk> , and who had often examined his weapons , — which were very beautiful , — if not with envy , at least with curiosity .
On the other hand , he was about to land , without any other <unk> than these men , on an island which had , indeed , a very religious name , but which did not seem to Franz likely to afford him much hospitality , thanks to the smugglers and bandits .
The history of the <unk> <unk> , which had appeared <unk> during the day , seemed very probable at night ; placed as he was between two possible <unk> of danger , he kept his eye on the crew , and his gun in his hand .
The sailors had again <unk> sail , and the vessel was once more <unk> the waves .
Through the darkness Franz , whose eyes were now more accustomed to it , could see the <unk> shore along which the boat was <unk> , and then , as they <unk> a <unk> point , he saw the fire more brilliant than ever , and about it five or six persons seated .
The <unk> <unk> the sea for a hundred paces around .
Gaetano <unk> the light , carefully keeping the boat in the shadow ; then , when they were opposite the fire , he <unk> to the centre of the circle , singing a <unk> song , of which his companions <unk> the <unk> .
At the first words of the song the men seated round the fire arose and approached the <unk> , their eyes fixed on the boat , evidently seeking to know who the <unk> were and what were their intentions .
They soon appeared satisfied and returned ( with the exception of one , who remained at the shore ) to their fire , at which the <unk> of a <unk> was <unk> .
When the boat was within twenty paces of the shore , the man on the <unk> , who carried a <unk> , presented arms after the manner of a sentinel , and cried , “ Who comes there ? ” in <unk> .
Franz <unk> <unk> both <unk> .
Gaetano then exchanged a few words with this man which the traveller did not understand , but which evidently concerned him .
“ Will your excellency give your name , or remain _ <unk> _ ? ” asked the captain .
“ My name must rest unknown , ” replied Franz ; “ merely say I am a Frenchman travelling for pleasure . ” As soon as Gaetano had <unk> this answer , the sentinel gave an order to one of the men seated round the fire , who rose and disappeared among the rocks .
Not a word was spoken , everyone seemed occupied , Franz with his <unk> , the sailors with their sails , the smugglers with their <unk> ; but in the midst of all this <unk> it was evident that they <unk> observed each other .
The man who had disappeared returned suddenly on the opposite side to that by which he had left ; he made a sign with his head to the sentinel , who , turning to the boat , said , “ _ S ’ <unk> _ . ” The Italian _ s ’ <unk> _ is <unk> ; it means at once , “ Come , enter , you are welcome ; make yourself at home ; you are the master . ” It is like that <unk> phrase of <unk> ’ s that so astonished the bourgeois gentleman by the number of things <unk> in its utterance .
The sailors did not wait for a second invitation ; four <unk> of the <unk> brought them to land ; Gaetano sprang to shore , exchanged a few words with the sentinel , then his comrades <unk> , and <unk> came Franz .
One of his guns was <unk> over his shoulder , Gaetano had the other , and a sailor held his <unk> ; his dress , half artist , half <unk> , did not excite any suspicion , and , consequently , no <unk> .
The boat was <unk> to the shore , and they advanced a few paces to find a comfortable <unk> ; but , doubtless , the spot they chose did not suit the <unk> who filled the post of sentinel , for he cried out : “ Not that way , if you please . ” Gaetano <unk> an excuse , and advanced to the opposite side , while two sailors <unk> <unk> at the fire to light them on their way .
They advanced about thirty paces , and then stopped at a small <unk> surrounded with rocks , in which <unk> had been cut , not unlike <unk> .
<unk> in the <unk> of the rocks grew a few <unk> <unk> and thick <unk> of <unk> .
Franz lowered a torch , and saw by the mass of <unk> that had <unk> that he was not the first to discover this retreat , which was , doubtless , one of the <unk> of the wandering visitors of Monte Cristo .
As for his suspicions , once on _ <unk> <unk> _ , once that he had seen the indifferent , if not friendly , appearance of his <unk> , his anxiety had quite disappeared , or rather , at sight of the <unk> , had turned to appetite .
He mentioned this to Gaetano , who replied that nothing could be more easy than to prepare a supper when they had in their boat , bread , wine , half a dozen <unk> , and a good fire to <unk> them by .
“ Besides , ” added he , “ if the smell of their <unk> meat <unk> you , I will go and offer them two of our birds for a <unk> . ” “ You are a born <unk> , ” returned Franz ; “ go and try . ” Meanwhile the sailors had collected dried <unk> and branches with which they made a fire .
Franz waited impatiently , <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> meat , when the captain returned with a mysterious air .
“ Well , ” said Franz , “ anything new ? — do they refuse ? ” “ On the contrary , ” returned Gaetano , “ the chief , who was told you were a young Frenchman , <unk> you to <unk> with him . ” “ Well , ” observed Franz , “ this chief is very <unk> , and I see no objection — the more so as I bring my share of the supper . ” “ Oh , it is not that ; he has plenty , and to spare , for supper ; but he makes one condition , and rather a peculiar one , before he will receive you at his house . ” “ His house ?
Has he built one here , then ? ” “ No , but he has a very comfortable one all the same , so they say . ” “ You know this chief , then ? ” “ I have heard talk of him . ” “ <unk> or otherwise ? ” “ Both . ” “ The deuce ! — and what is this condition ? ” “ That you are <unk> , and do not take off the <unk> until he himself <unk> you . ” Franz looked at Gaetano , to see , if possible , what he thought of this proposal .
“ Ah , ” replied he , <unk> Franz ’ s thought , “ I know this is a serious matter . ” “ What should you do in my place ? ” “ I , who have nothing to lose , — I should go . ” <unk> “ You would accept ? ” “ Yes , were it only out of curiosity . ” “ There is something very peculiar about this chief , then ? ” “ Listen , ” said Gaetano , <unk> his voice , “ I do not know if what they say is true ” — he stopped to see if anyone was near .
“ What do they say ? ” “ That this chief <unk> a cavern to which the <unk> <unk> is nothing . ” “ What nonsense ! ” said Franz , <unk> himself .
“ It is no nonsense ; it is quite true .
<unk> , the <unk> of the _ Saint <unk> _ , went in once , and he came back amazed , <unk> that such treasures were only to be heard of in <unk> <unk> . ” “ Do you know , ” observed Franz , “ that with such stories you make me think of Ali <unk> ’ s <unk> cavern ? ” “ I tell you what I have been told . ” “ Then you advise me to accept ? ” “ Oh , I don ’ t say that ; your excellency will do as you please ; I should be sorry to advise you in the matter . ” Franz <unk> the matter for a few moments , concluded that a man so rich could not have any intention of <unk> him of what little he had , and seeing only the prospect of a good supper , accepted .
Gaetano departed with the reply .
Franz was prudent , and wished to learn all he possibly could concerning his host .
He turned towards the sailor , who , during this dialogue , had sat gravely <unk> the <unk> with the air of a man proud of his office , and asked him how these men had landed , as no vessel of any kind was visible .
“ Never mind that , ” returned the sailor , “ I know their vessel . ” “ Is it a very beautiful vessel ? ” “ I would not wish for a better to sail round the world . ” “ Of what burden is she ? ” “ About a hundred <unk> ; but she is built to stand any weather .
She is what the English call a yacht . ” “ Where was she built ? ” “ I know not ; but my own opinion is she is a <unk> . ” “ And how did a leader of smugglers , ” continued Franz , “ venture to <unk> a vessel <unk> for such a purpose at <unk> ? ” “ I did not say that the owner was a <unk> , ” replied the sailor .
“ No ; but Gaetano did , I thought . ” “ Gaetano had only seen the vessel from a distance , he had not then spoken to anyone . ” “ And if this person be not a <unk> , who is he ? ” “ A wealthy <unk> , who <unk> for his pleasure . ” “ Come , ” thought Franz , “ he is still more mysterious , since the two accounts do not agree . ” “ What is his name ? ” “ If you ask him , he says Sinbad the <unk> ; but I doubt if it be his real name . ” “ Sinbad the <unk> ? ” “ Yes . ” “ And where does he <unk> ? ” “ On the sea . ” “ What country does he come from ? ” “ I do not know . ” “ Have you ever seen him ? ” “ Sometimes . ” “ What sort of a man is he ? ” “ Your excellency will judge for yourself . ” “ Where will he receive me ? ” “ No doubt in the subterranean palace Gaetano told you of . ” “ Have you never had the curiosity , when you have landed and found this island deserted , to seek for this <unk> palace ? ” “ Oh , yes , more than once , but always in vain ; we examined the grotto all over , but we never could find the slightest trace of any opening ; they say that the door is not opened by a key , but a <unk> word . ” “ <unk> , ” muttered Franz , “ this is an Arabian <unk> ’ adventure . ” “ His excellency <unk> for you , ” said a voice , which he recognized as that of the sentinel .
He was accompanied by two of the yacht ’ s crew .
Franz drew his handkerchief from his pocket , and presented it to the man who had spoken to him .
Without uttering a word , they <unk> his eyes with a care that showed their <unk> of his <unk> some <unk> .
<unk> he was made to promise that he would not make the least attempt to raise the <unk> .
He promised .
Then his two <unk> took his arms , and he went on , guided by them , and preceded by the sentinel .
After going about thirty paces , he <unk> the <unk> odor of the <unk> that was <unk> , and knew thus that he was passing the <unk> ; they then led him on about fifty paces farther , evidently advancing towards that part of the shore where they would not allow Gaetano to go — a refusal he could now comprehend .
<unk> , by a change in the <unk> , he knew that they were entering a <unk> ; after going on for a few seconds more he heard a <unk> , and it seemed to him as though the <unk> again changed , and became <unk> and <unk> .
At length his feet touched on a thick and soft <unk> , and his <unk> let go their hold of him .
There was a moment ’ s silence , and then a voice , in excellent French , although , with a foreign accent , said : “ <unk> , sir .
I beg you will remove your <unk> . ” It may be supposed , then , Franz did not wait for a <unk> of this permission , but took off the handkerchief , and found himself in the presence of a man from <unk> to forty years of age , dressed in a <unk> costume , that is to say , a red cap with a long blue silk <unk> , a <unk> of black cloth embroidered with gold , <unk> of deep red , large and full <unk> of the same color , embroidered with gold like the <unk> , and yellow <unk> ; he had a splendid <unk> round his waist , and a small sharp and <unk> <unk> was passed through his <unk> .
Although of a <unk> that was almost livid , this man had a remarkably handsome face ; his eyes were penetrating and sparkling ; his nose , quite straight , and <unk> direct from the brow , was of the pure Greek type , while his teeth , as white as pearls , were set off to admiration by the black <unk> that <unk> them .
His pallor was so peculiar , that it seemed to <unk> to one who had been long <unk> , and who was incapable of <unk> the <unk> glow and hue of life .
He was not particularly tall , but extremely well made , and , like the men of the South , had small hands and feet .
But what astonished Franz , who had treated Gaetano ’ s description as a <unk> , was the splendor of the apartment in which he found himself .
The entire chamber was <unk> with <unk> <unk> , worked with flowers of gold .
In a <unk> was a kind of <unk> , surmounted with a stand of Arabian swords in silver <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> with <unk> ; from the ceiling hung a lamp of <unk> glass , of beautiful shape and color , while the feet rested on a <unk> <unk> , in which they sunk to the <unk> ; <unk> hung before the door by which Franz had entered , and also in front of another door , leading into a second apartment which seemed to be <unk> illuminated .
The host gave Franz time to recover from his surprise , and , moreover , returned look for look , not even taking his eyes off him .
“ Sir , ” he said , after a pause , “ a thousand <unk> for the precaution taken in your introduction hither ; but as , during the greater portion of the year , this island is deserted , if the secret of this abode were discovered , I should doubtless , find on my return my <unk> <unk> in a state of great disorder , which would be exceedingly <unk> , not for the loss it <unk> me , but because I should not have the certainty I now possess of <unk> myself from all the rest of mankind at pleasure .
Let me now endeavor to make you forget this <unk> <unk> , and offer you what no doubt you did not expect to find here — that is to say , a tolerable supper and pretty comfortable beds . ” “ _ Ma foi _ , my dear sir , ” replied Franz , “ make no <unk> .
I have always observed that they <unk> people ’ s eyes who penetrate <unk> <unk> , for instance , those of <unk> in the _ <unk> _ , and really I have nothing to complain of , for what I see makes me think of the <unk> of the _ Arabian <unk> _ . ” <unk> “ Alas !
I may say with <unk> , if I could have anticipated the honor of your visit , I would have prepared for it .
But such as is my <unk> , it is at your disposal ; such as is my supper , it is yours to share , if you will .
Ali , is the supper ready ? ” At this moment the <unk> moved aside , and a <unk> , black as <unk> , and dressed in a plain white <unk> , made a sign to his master that all was prepared in the dining-room .
“ Now , ” said the unknown to Franz , “ I do not know if you are of my opinion , but I think nothing is more <unk> than to remain two or three hours together without knowing by name or <unk> how to address one another .
Pray observe , that I too much respect the laws of hospitality to ask your name or title .
I only request you to give me one by which I may have the pleasure of addressing you .
As for myself , that I may put you at your ease , I tell you that I am generally called ‘ Sinbad the <unk> . ’ ” “ And I , ” replied Franz , “ will tell you , as I only require his wonderful lamp to make me precisely like <unk> , that I see no reason why at this moment I should not be called <unk> .
That will keep us from going away from the East whither I am tempted to think I have been conveyed by some good genius . ” “ Well , then , Signor <unk> , ” replied the singular <unk> , “ you heard our <unk> announced , will you now take the trouble to enter the dining-room , your humble servant going first to show the way ? ” At these words , moving aside the <unk> , Sinbad preceded his guest .
Franz now looked upon another scene of <unk> ; the table was <unk> covered , and once convinced of this important point he cast his eyes around him .
The dining-room was scarcely less striking than the room he had just left ; it was entirely of marble , with antique <unk> of <unk> value ; and at the four corners of this apartment , which was <unk> , were four magnificent <unk> , having <unk> in their hands .
These <unk> contained four <unk> of most splendid fruit ; there were <unk> <unk> , <unk> from <unk> , <unk> from the <unk> <unk> , <unk> from France , and <unk> from <unk> .
The supper consisted of a <unk> <unk> <unk> with Corsican <unk> ; a <unk> ’ s <unk> with <unk> , a quarter of a <unk> with <unk> <unk> , a <unk> <unk> , and a gigantic <unk> .
Between these large <unk> were <unk> ones containing various <unk> .
The <unk> were of silver , and the <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
Franz <unk> his eyes in order to assure himself that this was not a dream .
Ali alone was present to wait at table , and <unk> himself so admirably , that the guest <unk> his host <unk> .
“ Yes , ” replied he , while he did the <unk> of the supper with much ease and grace — “ yes , he is a poor devil who is much devoted to me , and does all he can to prove it .
He <unk> that I saved his life , and as he has a regard for his head , he feels some gratitude towards me for having kept it on his shoulders . ” Ali approached his master , took his hand , and kissed it .
“ Would it be <unk> , Signor Sinbad , ” said Franz , “ to ask you the particulars of this kindness ? ” <unk> “ Oh , they are simple enough , ” replied the host .
“ It seems the fellow had been caught wandering nearer to the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> than <unk> <unk> to one of his color , and he was condemned by the <unk> to have his tongue cut out , and his hand and head cut off ; the tongue the first day , the hand the second , and the head the third .
I always had a desire to have a mute in my service , so <unk> the day his tongue was cut out , I went to the <unk> , and proposed to give him for Ali a splendid <unk> gun , which I knew he was very desirous of having .
He hesitated a moment , he was so very desirous to complete the poor devil ’ s punishment .
But when I added to the gun an English <unk> with which I had <unk> his <unk> ’ s <unk> to pieces , the <unk> yielded , and agreed to forgive the hand and head , but on condition that the poor fellow never again set foot in <unk> .
This was a useless <unk> in the <unk> , for whenever the coward sees the first glimpse of the <unk> of <unk> , he runs down below , and can only be induced to appear again when we are out of sight of that quarter of the <unk> . ” Franz remained a moment silent and <unk> , hardly knowing what to think of the <unk> , <unk> , with which his host related the brief <unk> .
“ And like the celebrated sailor whose name you have assumed , ” he said , by way of changing the conversation , “ you pass your life in travelling ? ” “ Yes .
I made a <unk> at a time when I little thought I should ever be able to accomplish it , ” said the unknown with a singular smile ; “ and I made some others also which I hope I may fulfil in due season . ” Although Sinbad pronounced these words with much calmness , his eyes gave forth <unk> of extraordinary <unk> .
“ You have suffered a great deal , sir ? ” said Franz <unk> .
Sinbad started and looked <unk> at him , as he replied , “ What makes you suppose so ? ” “ Everything , ” answered Franz , — “ your voice , your look , your <unk> complexion , and even the life you lead . ” “ I ? — I live the <unk> life possible , the real life of a <unk> .
I am king of all creation .
I am pleased with one place , and stay there ; I get tired of it , and leave it ; I am free as a bird and have wings like one ; my attendants obey my slightest wish .
Sometimes I amuse myself by <unk> some bandit or criminal from the bonds of the law .
Then I have my mode of <unk> justice , silent and sure , without <unk> or appeal , which <unk> or <unk> , and which no one sees .
Ah , if you had <unk> my life , you would not desire any other , and would never return to the world unless you had some great project to accomplish there . ” “ <unk> , for instance ! ” observed Franz .
The unknown fixed on the young man one of those looks which penetrate into the depth of the heart and thoughts .
“ And why revenge ? ” he asked .
“ Because , ” replied Franz , “ you seem to me like a man who , <unk> by society , has a fearful account to settle with it . ” “ Ah ! ” responded Sinbad , laughing with his singular laugh , which displayed his white and sharp teeth .
“ You have not guessed rightly .
Such as you see me I am , a sort of philosopher , and one day perhaps I shall go to Paris to <unk> Monsieur <unk> , and the man in the little blue cloak . ” “ And will that be the first time you ever took that journey ? ” “ Yes ; it will .
I must seem to you by no means curious , but I assure you that it is not my fault I have delayed it so long — it will happen one day or the other . ” <unk> “ And do you propose to make this journey very shortly ? ” “ I do not know ; it depends on circumstances which depend on certain arrangements . ” “ I should like to be there at the time you come , and I will endeavor to <unk> you , as far as lies in my power , for your liberal hospitality displayed to me at Monte Cristo . ” “ I should <unk> myself of your offer with pleasure , ” replied the host , “ but , unfortunately , if I go there , it will be , in all probability , _ <unk> _ . ” The supper appeared to have been supplied <unk> for Franz , for the unknown scarcely touched one or two <unk> of the splendid <unk> to which his guest did <unk> justice .
Then Ali brought on the <unk> , or rather took the <unk> from the hands of the <unk> and placed them on the table .
Between the two <unk> he placed a small silver cup with a silver cover .
The care with which Ali placed this cup on the table roused Franz ’ s curiosity .
He raised the cover and saw a kind of <unk> <unk> , something like preserved <unk> , but which was perfectly unknown to him .
He replaced the <unk> , as ignorant of what the cup contained as he was before he had looked at it , and then casting his eyes towards his host he saw him smile at his disappointment .
“ You cannot guess , ” said he , “ what there is in that small <unk> , can you ? ” “ No , I really cannot . ” “ Well , then , that green preserve is nothing less than the <unk> which <unk> served at the table of <unk> . ” “ But , ” replied Franz , “ this <unk> , no doubt , in passing through mortal hands has lost its <unk> <unk> and assumed a human name ; in vulgar phrase , what may you <unk> this <unk> , for which , to tell the truth , I do not feel any particular desire ? ” “ Ah , thus it is that our material origin is revealed , ” cried Sinbad ; “ we frequently pass so near to happiness without seeing , without regarding it , or if we do see and regard it , yet without <unk> it .
Are you a man for the <unk> , and is gold your <unk> ?
taste this , and the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> are opened to you .
Are you a man of imagination — a poet ?
taste this , and the <unk> of possibility disappear ; the fields of infinite space open to you , you advance free in heart , free in mind , into the <unk> <unk> of <unk> reverie .
Are you <unk> , and do you seek after the <unk> of the earth ?
taste this , and in an hour you will be a king , not a king of a petty <unk> hidden in some corner of Europe like France , Spain , or England , but king of the world , king of the universe , king of creation ; without bowing at the feet of <unk> , you will be king and master of all the <unk> of the earth .
Is it not <unk> what I offer you , and is it not an easy thing , since it is only to do thus ?
look ! ” At these words he <unk> the small cup which contained the substance so <unk> , took a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , raised it to his lips , and swallowed it slowly with his eyes half shut and his head bent <unk> .
Franz did not disturb him whilst he absorbed his favorite <unk> , but when he had finished , he inquired : “ What , then , is this precious stuff ? ” “ Did you ever hear , ” he replied , “ of the Old Man of the <unk> , who attempted to <unk> Philippe <unk> ? ” “ Of course I have . ” “ Well , you know he reigned over a rich valley which was <unk> by the mountain whence he <unk> his picturesque name .
In this valley were magnificent gardens planted by <unk> , and in these gardens isolated <unk> .
<unk> these <unk> he admitted the <unk> , and there , says <unk> <unk> , gave them to eat a certain <unk> , which <unk> them to <unk> , in the midst of <unk> <unk> , <unk> fruit , and <unk> <unk> .
What these happy persons took for reality was but a dream ; but it was a dream so soft , so <unk> , so <unk> , that they sold themselves body and soul to him who gave it to them , and <unk> to his orders as to those of a <unk> , struck down the designated victim , died in torture without a murmur , believing that the death they <unk> was but a quick <unk> to that life of <unk> of which the holy <unk> , now before you , had given them a slight <unk> . ” “ Then , ” cried Franz , “ it is <unk> !
I know that — by name at least . ” “ That is it precisely , Signor <unk> ; it is <unk> — the <unk> and most <unk> <unk> of <unk> , — the <unk> of <unk> , the celebrated <unk> , the only man , the man to whom there should be built a palace , <unk> with these words , _ A grateful world to the <unk> in happiness _ . ” “ Do you know , ” said Franz , “ I have a very great inclination to judge for myself of the truth or <unk> of your <unk> . ” “ <unk> for yourself , Signor <unk> — judge , but do not confine yourself to one trial .
Like everything else , we must <unk> the senses to a fresh impression , gentle or violent , sad or joyous .
There is a struggle in nature against this divine substance , — in nature which is not made for joy and <unk> to pain .
Nature <unk> must yield in the combat , the dream must succeed to reality , and then the dream <unk> supreme , then the dream becomes life , and life becomes the dream .
But what changes occur !
It is only by <unk> the pains of actual being with the joys of the assumed existence , that you would desire to live no longer , but to dream thus forever .
When you return to this <unk> <unk> from your <unk> world , you would seem to leave a <unk> spring for a <unk> winter — to quit paradise for earth — heaven for hell !
<unk> the <unk> , guest of mine — taste the <unk> . ” Franz ’ s only reply was to take a <unk> of the marvellous preparation , about as much in quantity as his host had eaten , and lift it to his mouth .
“ _ <unk> ! _ ” he said , after having swallowed the divine preserve .
“ I do not know if the result will be as agreeable as you describe , but the thing does not appear to me as <unk> as you say . ” “ Because your <unk> his not yet been <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> it <unk> .
Tell me , the first time you <unk> <unk> , tea , porter , <unk> , and <unk> other <unk> which you now adore , did you like them ?
Could you comprehend how the <unk> <unk> their <unk> with <unk> , and the <unk> eat <unk> ’ <unk> ?
<unk> ?
no !
Well , it is the same with <unk> ; only eat for a week , and nothing in the world will seem to you to equal the delicacy of its <unk> , which now appears to you flat and <unk> .
Let us now go into the adjoining chamber , which is your apartment , and Ali will bring us coffee and <unk> . ” They both arose , and while he who called himself Sinbad — and whom we have occasionally named so , that we might , like his guest , have some title by which to distinguish him — gave some orders to the servant , Franz entered still another apartment .
It was simply yet <unk> furnished .
It was round , and a large <unk> completely <unk> it .
<unk> , walls , ceiling , floor , were all covered with magnificent <unk> as soft and <unk> as the <unk> <unk> ; there were <unk> <unk> from <unk> , <unk> <unk> from <unk> ; <unk> from the <unk> , <unk> <unk> , like those that appeared to <unk> ; <unk> from <unk> , <unk> from <unk> , and so on ; and all these <unk> were <unk> in <unk> one on the other , so that it seemed like walking over the most <unk> <unk> , or <unk> on the most <unk> bed .
Both laid themselves down on the <unk> ; <unk> with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> were within reach , and all prepared so that there was no need to smoke the same <unk> twice .
Each of them took one , which Ali lighted and then retired to prepare the coffee .
There was a moment ’ s silence , during which Sinbad gave himself up to thoughts that seemed to occupy him incessantly , even in the midst of his conversation ; and Franz abandoned himself to that mute reverie , into which we always sink when smoking excellent <unk> , which seems to remove with its <unk> all the <unk> of the mind , and to give the <unk> in exchange all the <unk> of the soul .
Ali brought in the coffee .
“ How do you take it ? ” inquired the unknown ; “ in the French or <unk> style , strong or weak , <unk> or none , cool or <unk> ?
As you please ; it is ready in all ways . ” “ I will take it in the <unk> style , ” replied Franz .
“ And you are right , ” said his host ; “ it shows you have a <unk> for an <unk> life .
Ah , those <unk> ; they are the only men who know how to live .
As for me , ” he added , with one of those singular smiles which did not escape the young man , “ when I have completed my affairs in Paris , I shall go and die in the East ; and should you wish to see me again , you must seek me at <unk> , <unk> , or <unk> . ” <unk> “ _ Ma foi _ , ” said Franz , “ it would be the <unk> thing in the world ; for I feel eagle ’ s wings <unk> out at my shoulders , and with those wings I could make a tour of the world in <unk> hours . ” “ Ah , yes , the <unk> is beginning its work .
Well , <unk> your wings , and fly into <unk> <unk> ; fear nothing , there is a watch over you ; and if your wings , like those of <unk> , <unk> before the sun , we are here to ease your fall . ” He then said something in <unk> to Ali , who made a sign of obedience and withdrew , but not to any distance .
As to Franz a strange <unk> had taken place in him .
All the <unk> fatigue of the day , all the <unk> of mind which the events of the evening had brought on , disappeared as they do at the first approach of sleep , when we are still sufficiently conscious to be aware of the coming of slumber .
His body seemed to <unk> an <unk> <unk> , his <unk> <unk> in a remarkable manner , his senses seemed to <unk> their power , the horizon continued to <unk> ; but it was not the gloomy horizon of vague <unk> , and which he had seen before he slept , but a blue , <unk> , <unk> horizon , with all the blue of the ocean , all the <unk> of the sun , all the <unk> of the summer breeze ; then , in the midst of the songs of his sailors , — songs so clear and <unk> , that they would have made a divine <unk> had their notes been taken down , — he saw the Island of Monte Cristo , no longer as a threatening rock in the midst of the waves , but as an <unk> in the desert ; then , as his boat drew nearer , the songs became <unk> , for an <unk> and mysterious <unk> rose to heaven , as if some <unk> had <unk> to attract a soul thither , or <unk> , the <unk> , intended there to <unk> a city .
At length the boat touched the shore , but without effort , without shock , as lips touch lips ; and he entered the grotto <unk> continued <unk> of most <unk> <unk> .
He descended , or rather seemed to descend , several steps , <unk> the fresh and <unk> air , like that which may be supposed to <unk> around the grotto of <unk> , formed from such <unk> as set the mind <unk> , and such <unk> as burn the very senses ; and he saw again all he had seen before his sleep , from Sinbad , his singular host , to Ali , the mute attendant ; then all seemed to <unk> away and become confused before his eyes , like the last shadows of the <unk> lantern before it is extinguished , and he was again in the chamber of <unk> , lighted only by one of those pale and antique lamps which watch in the dead of the night over the sleep of pleasure .
They were the same <unk> , rich in form , in <unk> , and <unk> , with eyes of <unk> , smiles of love , and bright and <unk> hair .
They were <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , those three celebrated <unk> .
Then among them <unk> like a pure ray , like a Christian angel in the midst of <unk> , one of those <unk> figures , those calm shadows , those soft <unk> , which seemed to veil its virgin brow before these marble <unk> .
Then the three <unk> advanced towards him with looks of love , and approached the <unk> on which he was <unk> , their feet hidden in their long white <unk> , their <unk> bare , hair <unk> like waves , and <unk> <unk> which the <unk> could not resist , but which <unk> <unk> , and looks <unk> and ardent like those with which the <unk> <unk> the bird ; and then he gave way before looks that held him in a <unk> grasp and delighted his senses as with a <unk> kiss .
It seemed to Franz that he closed his eyes , and in a last look about him saw the vision of modesty completely veiled ; and then followed a dream of passion like that promised by the <unk> to the <unk> .
<unk> of stone turned to flame , <unk> of ice became like <unk> <unk> , so that to Franz , <unk> for the first time to the <unk> of the <unk> , love was a sorrow and <unk> a torture , as burning mouths were pressed to his <unk> lips , and he was held in cool <unk> <unk> .
The more he strove against this <unk> passion the more his senses yielded to its <unk> , and at length , weary of a struggle that <unk> his very soul , he gave way and sank back breathless and exhausted beneath the <unk> of these marble <unk> , and the <unk> of his marvellous dream .
Chapter <unk> .
The <unk> When Franz returned to himself , he seemed still to be in a dream .
He thought himself in a sepulchre , into which a ray of sunlight in pity scarcely penetrated .
He stretched forth his hand , and touched stone ; he rose to his seat , and found himself lying on his <unk> in a bed of dry <unk> , very soft and <unk> .
The vision had fled ; and as if the <unk> had been but shadows from the tomb , they had vanished at his waking .
He advanced several paces towards the point whence the light came , and to all the excitement of his dream succeeded the calmness of reality .
He found that he was in a grotto , went towards the opening , and through a kind of <unk> saw a blue sea and an azure sky .
The air and water were shining in the <unk> of the morning sun ; on the shore the sailors were sitting , <unk> and laughing ; and at ten <unk> from them the boat was at anchor , <unk> <unk> on the water .
There for some time he enjoyed the fresh breeze which played on his brow , and listened to the <unk> of the waves on the <unk> , that left against the rocks a lace of <unk> as white as silver .
He was for some time without reflection or thought for the divine charm which is in the things of nature , <unk> after a fantastic dream ; then gradually this view of the outer world , so calm , so pure , so grand , reminded him of the <unk> of his vision , and once more awakened memory .
He recalled his arrival on the island , his <unk> to a <unk> chief , a subterranean palace full of splendor , an excellent supper , and a <unk> of <unk> .
It seemed , however , even in the very face of open day , that at least a year had elapsed since all these things had passed , so deep was the impression made in his mind by the dream , and so strong a hold had it taken of his imagination .
Thus every now and then he saw in fancy amid the sailors , seated on a rock , or <unk> in the vessel , one of the shadows which had shared his dream with looks and <unk> .
<unk> , his head was perfectly clear , and his body <unk> ; he was free from the slightest <unk> ; on the contrary , he felt a certain degree of <unk> , a <unk> for <unk> the pure air , and <unk> the bright sunshine more <unk> than ever .
He went <unk> up to the sailors , who rose as soon as they perceived him ; and the patron , <unk> him , said : “ The Signor Sinbad has left his compliments for your excellency , and desires us to express the regret he feels at not being able to take his leave in person ; but he <unk> you will excuse him , as very important business calls him to <unk> . ” “ So , then , Gaetano , ” said Franz , “ this is , then , all reality ; there exists a man who has received me in this island , entertained me right <unk> , and has departed while I was asleep ? ” “ He exists as certainly as that you may see his small yacht with all her sails spread ; and if you will use your glass , you will , in all probability , recognize your host in the midst of his crew . ” So saying , Gaetano pointed in a direction in which a small vessel was making sail towards the <unk> point of Corsica .
Franz <unk> his <unk> , and directed it towards the yacht .
Gaetano was not mistaken .
At the stern the mysterious stranger was standing up looking towards the shore , and holding a <unk> in his hand .
He was <unk> as he had been on the previous evening , and <unk> his <unk> to his guest in <unk> of adieu .
Franz returned the salute by shaking his handkerchief as an exchange of <unk> .
After a second , a slight cloud of smoke was seen at the stern of the vessel , which rose <unk> as it <unk> in the air , and then Franz heard a slight report .
“ There , do you hear ? ” observed Gaetano ; “ he is <unk> you adieu . ” The young man took his <unk> and fired it in the air , but without any idea that the noise could be heard at the distance which separated the yacht from the shore .
“ What are your excellency ’ s orders ? ” inquired Gaetano .
“ In the first place , light me a torch . ” “ Ah , yes , I understand , ” replied the patron , “ to find the entrance to the <unk> apartment .
With much pleasure , your excellency , if it would amuse you ; and I will get you the torch you ask for .
But I too have had the idea you have , and two or three times the same fancy has come over me ; but I have always given it up .
<unk> , light a torch , ” he added , “ and give it to his excellency . ” <unk> obeyed .
Franz took the lamp , and entered the subterranean grotto , followed by Gaetano .
He recognized the place where he had <unk> by the bed of <unk> that was there ; but it was in vain that he carried his torch all round the <unk> surface of the grotto .
He saw nothing , unless that , by traces of smoke , others had before him attempted the same thing , and , like him , in vain .
Yet he did not leave a foot of this granite wall , as <unk> as <unk> , without strict <unk> ; he did not see a <unk> without <unk> the <unk> of his <unk> sword into it , or a <unk> point on which he did not <unk> and press in the hopes it would give way .
All was vain ; and he lost two hours in his attempts , which were at last utterly useless .
At the end of this time he gave up his search , and Gaetano smiled .
When Franz appeared again on the shore , the yacht only seemed like a small white <unk> on the horizon .
He looked again through his glass , but even then he could not distinguish anything .
Gaetano reminded him that he had come for the purpose of <unk> <unk> , which he had utterly forgotten .
He took his <unk> , and began to <unk> over the island with the air of a man who is <unk> a duty , rather than <unk> a pleasure ; and at the end of a quarter of an hour he had killed a <unk> and two <unk> .
These animals , though wild and <unk> as <unk> , were too much like domestic <unk> , and Franz could not consider them as game .
Moreover , other ideas , much more <unk> , occupied his mind .
Since , the evening before , he had really been the hero of one of the <unk> of the _ <unk> and One <unk> _ , and he was <unk> attracted towards the grotto .
Then , in spite of the failure of his first search , he began a second , after having told Gaetano to <unk> one of the two <unk> .
The second visit was a long one , and when he returned the <unk> was <unk> and the <unk> ready .
Franz was sitting on the spot where he was on the previous evening when his mysterious host had invited him to supper ; and he saw the little yacht , now like a <unk> on the wave , <unk> her flight towards Corsica .
“ Why , ” he remarked to Gaetano , “ you told me that Signor Sinbad was going to <unk> , while it seems he is in the direction of <unk> . ” “ Don ’ t you remember , ” said the patron , “ I told you that among the crew there were two Corsican <unk> ? ” “ True ; and he is going to land them , ” added Franz .
“ <unk> so , ” replied Gaetano .
“ Ah , he is one who fears neither God nor <unk> , they say , and would at any time run fifty leagues out of his course to do a poor devil a service . ” <unk> “ But such services as these might <unk> him with the authorities of the country in which he <unk> this kind of <unk> , ” said Franz .
“ And what cares he for that , ” replied Gaetano with a laugh , “ or any authorities ?
He smiles at them .
Let them try to pursue him !
Why , in the first place , his yacht is not a ship , but a bird , and he would beat any <unk> three <unk> in every nine ; and if he were to throw himself on the coast , why , is he not certain of finding friends everywhere ? ” It was perfectly clear that the Signor Sinbad , Franz ’ s host , had the honor of being on excellent terms with the smugglers and bandits along the whole coast of the <unk> , and so enjoyed <unk> <unk> .
As to Franz , he had no longer any <unk> to remain at Monte Cristo .
He had lost all hope of <unk> the secret of the grotto ; he consequently <unk> his breakfast , and , his boat being ready , he hastened on board , and they were soon under way .
At the moment the boat began her course they lost sight of the yacht , as it disappeared in the gulf of <unk> .
With it was <unk> the last trace of the preceding night ; and then supper , Sinbad , <unk> , <unk> , — all became a dream for Franz .
The boat <unk> on all day and all night , and next morning , when the sun rose , they had lost sight of Monte Cristo .
When Franz had once again set foot on shore , he forgot , for the moment at least , the events which had just passed , while he finished his affairs of pleasure at <unk> , and then thought of nothing but how he should <unk> his companion , who was awaiting him at Rome .
He set out , and on the Saturday evening reached the Place de la <unk> by the <unk> .
An apartment , as we have said , had been retained beforehand , and thus he had but to go to Signor Pastrini ’ s hotel .
But this was not so easy a matter , for the streets were <unk> with people , and Rome was already a prey to that low and feverish murmur which <unk> all great events ; and at Rome there are four great events in every year , — the Carnival , Holy <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> of St. <unk> .
All the rest of the year the city is in that state of dull <unk> , between life and death , which renders it similar to a kind of station between this world and the next — a sublime spot , a <unk> full of <unk> and character , and at which Franz had already halted five or six times , and at each time found it more marvellous and striking .
At last he made his way through the <unk> , which was continually increasing and getting more and more <unk> , and reached the hotel .
On his first inquiry he was told , with the <unk> peculiar to hired <unk> and <unk> with their houses full , that there was no room for him at the Hôtel de <unk> .
Then he sent his card to Signor Pastrini , and asked for Albert de Morcerf .
This plan succeeded ; and Signor Pastrini himself ran to him , <unk> himself for having made his excellency wait , <unk> the <unk> , taking the <unk> from the porter , who was ready to <unk> on the traveller and was about to lead him to Albert , when Morcerf himself appeared .
The apartment consisted of two small rooms and a <unk> .
The two rooms looked on to the street — a fact which Signor Pastrini <unk> upon as an <unk> advantage .
The rest of the floor was hired by a very rich gentleman who was supposed to be a <unk> or <unk> ; but the host was unable to decide to which of the two nations the traveller belonged .
“ Very good , <unk> Pastrini , ” said Franz ; “ but we must have some supper instantly , and a carriage for tomorrow and the following days . ” “ As to supper , ” replied the landlord , “ you shall be served immediately ; but as for the carriage — — ” “ What as to the carriage ? ” exclaimed Albert .
“ Come , come , Signor Pastrini , no <unk> ; we must have a carriage . ” “ Sir , ” replied the host , “ we will do all in our power to procure you one — this is all I can say . ” “ And when shall we know ? ” inquired Franz .
“ <unk> morning , ” answered the innkeeper .
“ Oh , the deuce !
then we shall pay the more , that ’ s all , I see plainly enough .
At <unk> ’ s or <unk> ’ s one <unk> twenty-five <unk> for common days , and thirty or <unk> <unk> a day more for <unk> and feast days ; add five <unk> a day more for <unk> , that will make forty , and there ’ s an end of it . ” “ I am afraid if we offer them double that we shall not procure a carriage . ” “ Then they must put horses to mine .
It is a little worse for the journey , but that ’ s no matter . ” “ There are no horses . ” Albert looked at Franz like a man who hears a reply he does not understand .
“ Do you understand that , my dear Franz — no horses ? ” he said , “ but can ’ t we have <unk> ? ” “ They have been all hired this fortnight , and there are none left but those absolutely requisite for <unk> . ” “ What are we to say to this ? ” asked Franz .
“ I say , that when a thing completely <unk> my <unk> , I am accustomed not to dwell on that thing , but to pass to another .
Is supper ready , Signor Pastrini ? ” “ Yes , your excellency . ” “ Well , then , let us <unk> . ” “ But the carriage and horses ? ” said Franz .
“ Be easy , my dear boy ; they will come in due season ; it is only a question of how much shall be charged for them . ” Morcerf then , with that delighted philosophy which <unk> that nothing is impossible to a full purse or <unk> <unk> , <unk> , went to bed , slept <unk> , and dreamed he was <unk> all over Rome at Carnival time in a coach with six horses .
Chapter <unk> .
Roman <unk> The next morning Franz woke first , and instantly rang the bell .
The sound had not yet died away when Signor Pastrini himself entered .
“ Well , excellency , ” said the landlord <unk> , and without waiting for Franz to question him , “ I feared yesterday , when I would not promise you anything , that you were too late — there is not a single carriage to be had — that is , for the three last days ” “ Yes , ” returned Franz , “ for the very three days it is most needed . ” “ What is the matter ? ” said Albert , entering ; “ no carriage to be had ? ” “ Just so , ” returned Franz , “ you have guessed it . ” “ Well , your <unk> <unk> is a nice sort of place . ” “ That is to say , excellency , ” replied Pastrini , who was desirous of keeping up the dignity of the capital of the Christian world in the eyes of his guest , “ that there are no carriages to be had from Sunday to Tuesday evening , but from now till Sunday you can have fifty if you please . ” “ Ah , that is something , ” said Albert ; “ today is <unk> , and who knows what may arrive between this and Sunday ? ” “ Ten or twelve thousand travellers will arrive , ” replied Franz , “ which will make it still more difficult . ” “ My friend , ” said Morcerf , “ let us enjoy the present without gloomy <unk> for the future . ” “ At least we can have a window ? ” “ Where ? ” “ In the <unk> . ” “ Ah , a window ! ” exclaimed Signor Pastrini , — “ utterly impossible ; there was only one left on the fifth floor of the <unk> <unk> , and that has been let to a <unk> prince for twenty <unk> a day . ” The two young men looked at each other with an air of <unk> .
“ Well , ” said Franz to Albert , “ do you know what is the best thing we can do ?
It is to pass the Carnival at <unk> ; there we are sure of obtaining <unk> if we cannot have carriages . ” “ Ah , the devil , no , ” cried Albert ; “ I came to Rome to see the Carnival , and I will , though I see it on <unk> . ” “ <unk> !
an excellent idea .
We will disguise ourselves as monster <unk> or <unk> of the <unk> , and we shall have complete success . ” “ Do your <unk> still wish for a carriage from now to Sunday morning ? ” “ _ <unk> ! _ ” said Albert , “ do you think we are going to run about on foot in the streets of Rome , like <unk> ’ <unk> ? ” “ I hasten to comply with your <unk> ’ wishes ; only , I tell you beforehand , the carriage will cost you six piastres a day . ” “ And , as I am not a <unk> , like the gentleman in the next apartments , ” said Franz , “ I warn you , that as I have been four times before at Rome , I know the <unk> of all the carriages ; we will give you twelve piastres for today , tomorrow , and the day after , and then you will make a good profit . ” “ But , excellency ” — said Pastrini , still <unk> to gain his point .
“ Now go , ” returned Franz , “ or I shall go myself and <unk> with your _ <unk> _ , who is mine also ; he is an old friend of mine , who has <unk> me pretty well already , and , in the hope of making more out of me , he will take a less price than the one I offer you ; you will lose the preference , and that will be your fault . ” “ Do not give yourselves the trouble , excellency , ” returned Signor Pastrini , with the smile peculiar to the Italian <unk> when he <unk> <unk> ; “ I will do all I can , and I hope you will be satisfied . ” “ And now we understand each other . ” “ When do you wish the carriage to be here ? ” “ In an hour . ” “ In an hour it will be at the door . ” An hour after the vehicle was at the door ; it was a <unk> <unk> which was elevated to the rank of a private carriage in honor of the occasion , but , in spite of its humble <unk> , the young men would have thought themselves happy to have secured it for the last three days of the Carnival .
“ <unk> , ” cried the _ <unk> _ , seeing Franz approach the window , “ shall I bring the carriage nearer to the palace ? ” <unk> as Franz was to the Italian <unk> , his first impulse was to look round him , but these words were addressed to him .
Franz was the “ excellency , ” the vehicle was the “ carriage , ” and the Hôtel de <unk> was the “ palace . ” The genius for <unk> characteristic of the race was in that phrase .
Franz and Albert descended , the carriage approached the palace ; their <unk> stretched their legs along the <unk> ; the _ <unk> _ sprang into the seat behind .
“ Where do your <unk> wish to go ? ” asked he .
“ To Saint <unk> ’ s first , and then to the Colosseum , ” returned Albert .
But Albert did not know that it takes a day to see Saint <unk> ’ s , and a month to study it .
The day was passed at Saint <unk> ’ s alone .
Suddenly the daylight began to <unk> away ; Franz took out his watch — it was half-past four .
They returned to the hotel ; at the door Franz ordered the coachman to be ready at eight .
He wished to show Albert the Colosseum by moonlight , as he had shown him Saint <unk> ’ s by daylight .
When we show a friend a city one has already visited , we feel the same pride as when we point out a woman whose lover we have been .
He was to leave the city by the <unk> del <unk> , <unk> the outer wall , and <unk> by the <unk> <unk> <unk> ; thus they would behold the Colosseum without finding their <unk> <unk> by first looking on the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , the Temple of <unk> and <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> .
They sat down to dinner .
Signor Pastrini had promised them a <unk> ; he gave them a tolerable <unk> .
At the end of the dinner he entered in person .
Franz thought that he came to hear his dinner <unk> , and began accordingly , but at the first words he was interrupted .
“ <unk> , ” said Pastrini , “ I am delighted to have your approbation , but it was not for that I came . ” “ Did you come to tell us you have procured a carriage ? ” asked Albert , <unk> his <unk> .
“ No ; and your <unk> will do well not to think of that any longer ; at Rome things can or cannot be done ; when you are told anything cannot be done , there is an end of it . ” “ It is much more convenient at Paris , — when anything cannot be done , you pay double , and it is done directly . ” “ That is what all the French say , ” returned Signor Pastrini , somewhat <unk> ; “ for that reason , I do not understand why they travel . ” “ But , ” said Albert , <unk> a volume of smoke and <unk> his chair on its <unk> legs , “ only <unk> , or <unk> like us , ever do travel .
Men in their senses do not quit their hotel in the Rue du <unk> , their walk on the Boulevard de <unk> , and the Café de Paris . ” It is of course understood that Albert <unk> in the <unk> street , appeared every day on the fashionable walk , and dined frequently at the only <unk> where you can really dine , that is , if you are on good terms with its <unk> .
Signor Pastrini remained silent a short time ; it was evident that he was <unk> over this answer , which did not seem very clear .
“ But , ” said Franz , in his turn <unk> his host ’ s <unk> , “ you had some motive for coming here , may I beg to know what it was ? ” <unk> “ Ah , yes ; you have ordered your carriage at eight o ’ clock precisely ? ” “ I have . ” “ You intend visiting _ <unk> <unk> _ . ” “ You mean the Colosseum ? ” “ It is the same thing .
You have told your coachman to leave the city by the <unk> del <unk> , to drive round the walls , and <unk> by the <unk> <unk> <unk> ? ” “ These are my words exactly . ” “ Well , this <unk> is impossible . ” “ Impossible ! ” “ Very dangerous , to say the least . ” “ <unk> ! — and why ? ” “ On account of the famous Luigi Vampa . ” “ Pray , who may this famous Luigi Vampa be ? ” inquired Albert ; “ he may be very famous at Rome , but I can assure you he is quite unknown at Paris . ” “ What !
do you not know him ? ” “ I have not that honor . ” “ You have never heard his name ? ” “ Never . ” “ Well , then , he is a bandit , compared to whom the <unk> and the <unk> were mere children . ” “ Now then , Albert , ” cried Franz , “ here is a bandit for you at last . ” “ I <unk> you , Signor Pastrini , that I shall not believe one word of what you are going to tell us ; having told you this , begin .
‘ Once upon a time — — ’ Well , go on . ” Signor Pastrini turned toward Franz , who seemed to him the more reasonable of the two ; we must do him justice , — he had had a great many <unk> in his house , but had never been able to comprehend them .
“ <unk> , ” said he gravely , addressing Franz , “ if you look upon me as a <unk> , it is useless for me to say anything ; it was for your interest I — — ” “ Albert does not say you are a <unk> , Signor Pastrini , ” said Franz , “ but that he will not believe what you are going to tell us , — but I will believe all you say ; so proceed . ” “ But if your excellency doubt my <unk> — — ” “ Signor Pastrini , ” returned Franz , “ you are more <unk> than <unk> , who was a <unk> , and yet no one believed her ; while you , at least , are sure of the <unk> of half your audience .
Come , sit down , and tell us all about this Signor Vampa . ” “ I had told your excellency he is the most famous bandit we have had since the days of <unk> . ” “ Well , what has this bandit to do with the order I have given the coachman to leave the city by the <unk> del <unk> , and to <unk> by the <unk> <unk> <unk> ? ” <unk> “ This , ” replied Signor Pastrini , “ that you will go out by one , but I very much doubt your returning by the other . ” “ Why ? ” asked Franz .
“ Because , after nightfall , you are not safe fifty <unk> from the gates . ” “ On your honor , is that true ? ” cried Albert .
“ Count , ” returned Signor Pastrini , hurt at Albert ’ s repeated doubts of the truth of his <unk> , “ I do not say this to you , but to your companion , who knows Rome , and knows , too , that these things are not to be laughed at . ” “ My dear fellow , ” said Albert , turning to Franz , “ here is an admirable adventure ; we will fill our carriage with pistols , <unk> , and <unk> guns .
Luigi Vampa comes to take us , and we take him — we bring him back to Rome , and present him to his <unk> the <unk> , who <unk> how he can <unk> so great a service ; then we merely ask for a carriage and a pair of horses , and we see the Carnival in the carriage , and doubtless the Roman people will crown us at the <unk> , and <unk> us , like <unk> and <unk> Cocles , the <unk> of their country . ” <unk> Albert proposed this scheme , Signor Pastrini ’ s face assumed an expression impossible to describe .
“ And pray , ” asked Franz , “ where are these pistols , <unk> , and other deadly weapons with which you intend <unk> the carriage ? ” “ Not out of my <unk> , for at <unk> I was <unk> even of my <unk> .
And you ? ” “ I shared the same fate at <unk> . ” “ Do you know , Signor Pastrini , ” said Albert , <unk> a second <unk> at the first , “ that this practice is very convenient for bandits , and that it seems to be due to an arrangement of their own . ” <unk> Signor Pastrini found this <unk> <unk> , for he only answered half the question , and then he spoke to Franz , as the only one likely to listen with attention .
“ Your excellency knows that it is not <unk> to defend yourself when attacked by bandits . ” “ What ! ” cried Albert , whose courage <unk> at the idea of being <unk> <unk> , “ not make any resistance ! ” “ No , for it would be useless .
What could you do against a dozen bandits who spring out of some <unk> , ruin , or <unk> , and level their pieces at you ? ” “ <unk> , _ <unk> ! _ — they should kill me . ” The innkeeper turned to Franz with an air that seemed to say , “ Your friend is decidedly mad . ” “ My dear Albert , ” returned Franz , “ your answer is sublime , and worthy the ‘ _ Let him die _ , ’ of <unk> , only , when <unk> made that answer , the safety of Rome was concerned ; but , as for us , it is only to <unk> a <unk> , and it would be ridiculous to risk our lives for so foolish a motive . ” Albert poured himself out a glass of _ <unk> <unk> _ , which he <unk> at intervals , <unk> some <unk> words .
“ Well , Signor Pastrini , ” said Franz , “ now that my companion is <unk> , and you have seen how peaceful my intentions are , tell me who is this Luigi Vampa .
Is he a shepherd or a <unk> ? — young or old ? — tall or short ?
<unk> him , in order that , if we meet him by chance , like Jean <unk> or <unk> , we may recognize him . ” “ You could not apply to anyone better able to inform you on all these points , for I knew him when he was a child , and one day that I fell into his hands , going from <unk> to <unk> , he , fortunately for me , recollected me , and set me free , not only without <unk> , but made me a present of a very splendid watch , and related his history to me . ” “ Let us see the watch , ” said Albert .
Signor Pastrini drew from his <unk> a magnificent <unk> , bearing the name of its <unk> , of Parisian <unk> , and a count ’ s <unk> .
“ Here it is , ” said he .
“ _ <unk> ! _ ” returned Albert , “ I compliment you on it ; I have its fellow ” — he took his watch from his waistcoat pocket — “ and it cost me <unk> francs . ” “ Let us hear the history , ” said Franz , <unk> Signor Pastrini to seat himself .
“ Your <unk> permit it ? ” asked the host .
“ _ <unk> ! _ ” cried Albert , “ you are not a <unk> , to remain standing ! ” The host sat down , after having made each of them a respectful bow , which meant that he was ready to tell them all they wished to know concerning Luigi Vampa .
“ You tell me , ” said Franz , at the moment Signor Pastrini was about to open his mouth , “ that you knew Luigi Vampa when he was a child — he is still a young man , then ? ” “ A young man ?
he is only <unk> ; — he will gain himself a reputation . ” “ What do you think of that , Albert ? — at <unk> to be thus famous ? ” “ Yes , and at his age , Alexander , Cæsar , and Napoleon , who have all made some noise in the world , were quite behind him . ” “ So , ” continued Franz , “ the hero of this history is only <unk> ? ” “ <unk> so much . ” “ Is he tall or short ? ” “ Of the middle height — about the same stature as his excellency , ” returned the host , pointing to Albert .
“ Thanks for the comparison , ” said Albert , with a bow .
“ Go on , Signor Pastrini , ” continued Franz , smiling at his friend ’ s <unk> .
“ To what class of society does he belong ? ” “ He was a <unk> attached to the farm of the Count of <unk> , situated between <unk> and the <unk> of <unk> ; he was born at <unk> , and entered the count ’ s service when he was five years old ; his father was also a shepherd , who owned a small <unk> , and lived by the <unk> and the milk , which he sold at Rome .
When quite a child , the little Vampa displayed a most extraordinary <unk> .
One day , when he was seven years old , he came to the <unk> of <unk> , and asked to be taught to read ; it was somewhat difficult , for he could not quit his <unk> ; but the good <unk> went every day to say mass at a little <unk> too poor to pay a priest and which , having no other name , was called <unk> ; he told Luigi that he might meet him on his return , and that then he would give him a lesson , warning him that it would be short , and that he must profit as much as possible by it .
The child accepted <unk> .
Every day Luigi led his <unk> to <unk> on the road that leads from <unk> to <unk> ; every day , at nine o ’ clock in the morning , the priest and the boy sat down on a bank by the <unk> , and the little shepherd took his lesson out of the priest ’ s <unk> .
At the end of three months he had learned to read .
This was not enough — he must now learn to write .
The priest had a writing <unk> at Rome make three <unk> — one large , one <unk> , and one small ; and pointed out to him that by the help of a sharp instrument he could trace the letters on a <unk> , and thus learn to write .
The same evening , when the <unk> was safe at the farm , the little Luigi hastened to the <unk> at <unk> , took a large nail , <unk> and <unk> it , and formed a sort of <unk> .
The next morning he gathered an <unk> of pieces of <unk> and began .
At the end of three months he had learned to write .
The <unk> , astonished at his <unk> and intelligence , made him a present of <unk> , paper , and a <unk> .
This demanded new effort , but nothing compared to the first ; at the end of a week he wrote as well with this pen as with the <unk> .
The <unk> related the incident to the Count of <unk> , who sent for the little shepherd , made him read and write before him , ordered his attendant to let him eat with the <unk> , and to give him two piastres a month .
With this , Luigi purchased books and <unk> .
He applied his <unk> powers to everything , and , like <unk> , when young , he drew on his <unk> <unk> , houses , and trees .
Then , with his knife , he began to <unk> all sorts of objects in wood ; it was thus that <unk> , the famous <unk> , had <unk> .
<unk> “ A girl of six or seven — that is , a little younger than Vampa — <unk> <unk> on a farm near <unk> ; she was an <unk> , born at <unk> and was named Teresa .
The two children met , sat down near each other , let their <unk> <unk> together , played , laughed , and <unk> together ; in the evening they separated the Count of <unk> ’ s <unk> from those of Baron <unk> , and the children returned to their <unk> <unk> , <unk> to meet the next morning .
The next day they kept their word , and thus they grew up together .
Vampa was twelve , and Teresa eleven .
And yet their natural disposition revealed itself .
<unk> his taste for the fine <unk> , which Luigi had carried as far as he could in his solitude , he was given to <unk> <unk> of sadness and enthusiasm , was often angry and <unk> , and always <unk> .
None of the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> , or <unk> had been able to gain any influence over him or even to become his companion .
His disposition ( always inclined to exact <unk> rather than to make them ) kept him <unk> from all <unk> .
Teresa alone <unk> by a look , a word , a gesture , this <unk> character , which yielded beneath the hand of a woman , and which beneath the hand of a man might have broken , but could never have been <unk> .
Teresa was lively and gay , but <unk> to excess .
The two piastres that Luigi received every month from the Count of <unk> ’ s steward , and the price of all the little <unk> in wood he sold at Rome , were <unk> in <unk> , <unk> , and gold <unk> .
So that , thanks to her friend ’ s <unk> , Teresa was the most beautiful and the <unk> peasant near Rome .
“ The two children grew up together , passing all their time with each other , and giving themselves up to the wild ideas of their different characters .
Thus , in all their dreams , their wishes , and their <unk> , Vampa saw himself the captain of a vessel , general of an army , or governor of a <unk> .
Teresa saw herself rich , <unk> <unk> , and attended by a train of <unk> <unk> .
Then , when they had thus passed the day in building <unk> in the air , they separated their <unk> , and descended from the <unk> of their dreams to the reality of their humble position .
“ One day the young shepherd told the count ’ s steward that he had seen a wolf come out of the <unk> mountains , and <unk> around his <unk> .
The steward gave him a gun ; this was what Vampa longed for .
This gun had an excellent <unk> , made at <unk> , and carrying a ball with the <unk> of an English <unk> ; but one day the count broke the stock , and had then cast the gun aside .
This , however , was nothing to a <unk> like Vampa ; he examined the broken stock , calculated what change it would require to <unk> the gun to his shoulder , and made a fresh stock , so <unk> <unk> that it would have <unk> fifteen or twenty piastres , had he chosen to sell it .
But nothing could be farther from his thoughts .
“ For a long time a gun had been the young man ’ s greatest ambition .
In every country where independence has taken the place of liberty , the first desire of a <unk> heart is to possess a weapon , which at once renders him capable of defence or attack , and , by <unk> its owner terrible , often makes him feared .
From this moment Vampa devoted all his leisure time to <unk> himself in the use of his precious weapon ; he purchased powder and ball , and everything served him for a mark — the <unk> of some old and <unk> <unk> , that grew on the <unk> mountains ; the <unk> , as he quitted his earth on some <unk> <unk> ; the eagle that <unk> above their heads : and thus he soon became so <unk> , that Teresa <unk> the terror she at first felt at the report , and amused herself by watching him direct the ball wherever he pleased , with as much <unk> as if he placed it by hand .
<unk> “ One evening a wolf emerged from a <unk> near which they were usually stationed , but the wolf had scarcely advanced ten <unk> ere he was dead .
<unk> of this <unk> , Vampa took the dead animal on his shoulders , and carried him to the farm .
These <unk> had gained Luigi considerable reputation .
The man of superior <unk> always finds <unk> , go where he will .
He was spoken of as the most <unk> , the <unk> , and the most <unk> _ <unk> _ for ten leagues around ; and although Teresa was <unk> allowed to be the most beautiful girl of the <unk> , no one had ever spoken to her of love , because it was known that she was beloved by Vampa .
And yet the two young people had never declared their affection ; they had grown together like two trees whose <unk> are mingled , whose branches <unk> , and whose <unk> perfume <unk> to the heavens .
Only their wish to see each other had become a necessity , and they would have preferred death to a day ’ s separation .
“ Teresa was sixteen , and Vampa seventeen .
About this time , a band of <unk> that had established itself in the <unk> mountains began to be much spoken of .
The <unk> have never been really <unk> from the neighborhood of Rome .
Sometimes a chief is wanted , but when a chief presents himself he rarely has to wait long for a band of <unk> .
“ The celebrated Cucumetto , pursued in the <unk> , driven out of the <unk> of Naples , where he had carried on a regular war , had crossed the <unk> , like <unk> , and had taken refuge on the banks of the <unk> between <unk> and <unk> .
He strove to collect a band of <unk> , and followed the footsteps of <unk> and <unk> , whom he hoped to <unk> .
Many young men of <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> had disappeared .
Their disappearance at first caused much <unk> ; but it was soon known that they had joined Cucumetto .
After some time Cucumetto became the object of universal attention ; the most extraordinary <unk> of ferocious daring and <unk> were related of him .
“ One day he carried off a young girl , the daughter of a <unk> of <unk> .
The bandit ’ s laws are <unk> ; a young girl belongs first to him who <unk> her off , then the rest draw <unk> for her , and she is abandoned to their <unk> until death <unk> her sufferings .
When their parents are sufficiently rich to pay a <unk> , a messenger is sent to <unk> ; the prisoner is <unk> for the security of the messenger ; should the <unk> be refused , the prisoner is <unk> lost .
The young girl ’ s lover was in Cucumetto ’ s <unk> ; his name was Carlini .
When she recognized her lover , the poor girl extended her arms to him , and believed herself safe ; but Carlini felt his heart sink , for he but too well knew the fate that awaited her .
However , as he was a favorite with Cucumetto , as he had for three years <unk> served him , and as he had saved his life by <unk> a <unk> who was about to cut him down , he hoped the chief would have pity on him .
He took Cucumetto one side , while the young girl , seated at the foot of a huge <unk> that stood in the centre of the forest , made a veil of her picturesque <unk> to hide her face from the <unk> gaze of the bandits .
There he told the chief all — his affection for the prisoner , their promises of mutual <unk> , and how every night , since he had been near , they had met in some neighboring ruins .
<unk> “ It so happened that night that Cucumetto had sent Carlini to a village , so that he had been unable to go to the place of meeting .
Cucumetto had been there , however , by accident , as he said , and had carried the <unk> off .
Carlini <unk> his chief to make an exception in <unk> ’ s favor , as her father was rich , and could pay a large <unk> .
Cucumetto seemed to yield to his friend ’ s <unk> , and bade him find a shepherd to send to <unk> ’ s father at <unk> .
“ Carlini flew <unk> to <unk> , telling her she was saved , and <unk> her write to her father , to inform him what had occurred , and that her <unk> was fixed at three hundred piastres .
<unk> hours ’ delay was all that was granted — that is , until nine the next morning .
The instant the letter was written , Carlini seized it , and hastened to the plain to find a messenger .
He found a young shepherd watching his <unk> .
The natural <unk> of the bandits are the <unk> who live between the city and the mountains , between <unk> and savage life .
The boy <unk> the commission , <unk> to be in <unk> in less than an hour .
Carlini returned , anxious to see his mistress , and announce the <unk> intelligence .
He found the <unk> in the <unk> , <unk> off the provisions <unk> as <unk> from the peasants ; but his eye <unk> sought <unk> and Cucumetto among them .
“ He inquired where they were , and was answered by a burst of laughter .
A cold perspiration burst from every <unk> , and his hair stood on end .
He repeated his question .
One of the bandits rose , and offered him a glass filled with <unk> , saying , ‘ To the health of the brave Cucumetto and the fair <unk> . ’ At this moment Carlini heard a woman ’ s cry ; he divined the truth , seized the glass , broke it across the face of him who presented it , and rushed towards the spot whence the cry came .
After a hundred <unk> he turned the corner of the thicket ; he found <unk> <unk> in the arms of Cucumetto .
At the sight of Carlini , Cucumetto rose , a pistol in each hand .
The two <unk> looked at each other for a moment — the one with a smile of <unk> on his lips , the other with the pallor of death on his brow .
A terrible battle between the two men seemed <unk> ; but by degrees Carlini ’ s features <unk> , his hand , which had grasped one of the pistols in his <unk> , fell to his side .
<unk> lay between them .
The moon lighted the group .
“ ‘ Well , ’ said Cucumetto , ‘ have you executed your commission ? ’ “ ‘ Yes , captain , ’ returned Carlini .
‘ At nine o ’ clock tomorrow <unk> ’ s father will be here with the money . ’ “ ‘ It is well ; in the meantime , we will have a merry night ; this young girl is charming , and does credit to your taste .
Now , as I am not <unk> , we will return to our comrades and draw <unk> for her . ’ “ ‘ You have determined , then , to abandon her to the common law ? ’ said Carlini .
“ ‘ Why should an exception be made in her favor ? ’ “ ‘ I thought that my <unk> — — ’ “ ‘ What right have you , any more than the rest , to ask for an exception ? ’ “ ‘ It is true . ’ “ ‘ But never mind , ’ continued Cucumetto , laughing , ‘ sooner or later your turn will come . ’ Carlini ’ s teeth clenched convulsively .
“ ‘ Now , then , ’ said Cucumetto , advancing towards the other bandits , ‘ are you coming ? ’ “ ‘ I follow you . ’ <unk> “ Cucumetto departed , without losing sight of Carlini , for , doubtless , he feared lest he should strike him <unk> ; but nothing betrayed a <unk> design on Carlini ’ s part .
He was standing , his arms folded , near <unk> , who was still <unk> .
Cucumetto fancied for a moment the young man was about to take her in his arms and fly ; but this <unk> little to him now <unk> had been his ; and as for the money , three hundred piastres distributed among the band was so small a sum that he cared little about it .
He continued to follow the path to the <unk> ; but , to his great surprise , Carlini arrived almost as soon as himself .
“ ‘ Let us draw <unk> !
let us draw <unk> ! ’ cried all the <unk> , when they saw the chief .
“ Their demand was fair , and the chief inclined his head in sign of <unk> .
The eyes of all shone <unk> as they made their demand , and the red light of the fire made them look like <unk> .
The names of all , including Carlini , were placed in a hat , and the youngest of the band drew forth a <unk> ; the <unk> bore the name of <unk> .
He was the man who had proposed to Carlini the health of their chief , and to whom Carlini replied by breaking the glass across his face .
A large wound , extending from the <unk> to the mouth , was bleeding <unk> .
<unk> , seeing himself thus <unk> by fortune , burst into a loud laugh .
“ ‘ Captain , ’ said he , ‘ just now Carlini would not drink your health when I proposed it to him ; propose mine to him , and let us see if he will be more <unk> to you than to me . ’ “ <unk> expected an <unk> on Carlini ’ s part ; but to their great surprise , he took a glass in one hand and a <unk> in the other , and <unk> it , — “ ‘ Your health , <unk> , ’ said he calmly , and he drank it off , without his hand trembling in the least .
Then sitting down by the fire , ‘ My supper , ’ said he ; ‘ my <unk> has given me an appetite . ’ “ ‘ Well done , Carlini ! ’ cried the <unk> ; ‘ that is acting like a good fellow ; ’ and they all formed a circle round the fire , while <unk> disappeared .
“ Carlini ate and drank as if nothing had happened .
The bandits looked on with astonishment at this singular conduct until they heard footsteps .
They turned round , and saw <unk> bearing the young girl in his arms .
Her head hung back , and her long hair swept the ground .
As they entered the circle , the bandits could perceive , by the <unk> , the <unk> pallor of the young girl and of <unk> .
This apparition was so strange and so solemn , that everyone rose , with the exception of Carlini , who remained seated , and ate and drank calmly .
<unk> advanced <unk> the most profound silence , and laid <unk> at the captain ’ s feet .
Then everyone could understand the cause of the <unk> pallor in the young girl and the bandit .
A knife was plunged up to the <unk> in <unk> ’ s left breast .
<unk> looked at Carlini ; the <unk> at his <unk> was empty .
“ ‘ Ah , <unk> , ’ said the chief , ‘ I now understand why Carlini <unk> behind . ’ “ All savage natures <unk> a desperate deed .
No other of the bandits would , perhaps , have done the same ; but they all understood what Carlini had done .
“ ‘ Now , then , ’ cried Carlini , rising in his turn , and approaching the corpse , his hand on the <unk> of one of his pistols , ‘ does anyone <unk> the possession of this woman with me ? ’ “ ‘ No , ’ returned the chief , ‘ she is <unk> . ’ “ Carlini raised her in his arms , and carried her out of the circle of <unk> .
Cucumetto placed his <unk> for the night , and the bandits wrapped themselves in their <unk> , and lay down before the fire .
At midnight the sentinel gave the alarm , and in an instant all were on the <unk> .
It was <unk> ’ s father , who brought his daughter ’ s <unk> in person .
“ ‘ Here , ’ said he , to Cucumetto , ‘ here are three hundred piastres ; give me back my child .
“ But the chief , without taking the money , made a sign to him to follow .
The old man obeyed .
They both advanced beneath the trees , through whose branches <unk> the moonlight .
Cucumetto stopped at last , and pointed to two persons <unk> at the foot of a tree .
“ ‘ There , ’ said he , ‘ demand thy child of Carlini ; he will tell thee what has become of her ; ’ and he returned to his companions .
“ The old man remained motionless ; he felt that some great and <unk> misfortune hung over his head .
At length he advanced toward the group , the meaning of which he could not comprehend .
As he approached , Carlini raised his head , and the forms of two persons became visible to the old man ’ s eyes .
A woman lay on the ground , her head resting on the knees of a man , who was seated by her ; as he raised his head , the woman ’ s face became visible .
The old man recognized his child , and Carlini recognized the old man .
“ ‘ I expected thee , ’ said the bandit to <unk> ’ s father .
“ ‘ <unk> ! ’ returned the old man , ‘ what <unk> thou done ? ’ and he gazed with terror on <unk> , pale and <unk> , a knife buried in her bosom .
A ray of moonlight poured through the trees , and lighted up the face of the dead .
“ ‘ Cucumetto had <unk> thy daughter , ’ said the bandit ; ‘ I loved her , therefore I <unk> her ; for she would have served as the <unk> of the whole band . ’ The old man spoke not , and grew pale as death .
‘ Now , ’ continued Carlini , ‘ if I have done <unk> , <unk> her ; ’ and <unk> the knife from the wound in <unk> ’ s bosom , he held it out to the old man with one hand , while with the other he tore open his <unk> .
“ ‘ Thou <unk> done well ! ’ returned the old man in a hoarse voice ; ‘ embrace me , my son . ’ <unk> Carlini threw himself , <unk> like a child , into the arms of his mistress ’ s father .
These were the first tears the man of blood had ever wept .
“ ‘ Now , ’ said the old man , ‘ aid me to <unk> my child . ’ Carlini <unk> two <unk> ; and the father and the lover began to <unk> at the foot of a huge <unk> , beneath which the young girl was to repose .
When the grave was formed , the father embraced her first , and then the lover ; afterwards , one taking the head , the other the feet , they placed her in the grave .
Then they knelt on each side of the grave , and said the prayers of the dead .
Then , when they had finished , they cast the earth over the corpse , until the grave was filled .
Then , extending his hand , the old man said ; ‘ I thank you , my son ; and now leave me alone . ’ “ ‘ Yet — — ’ replied Carlini .
“ ‘ Leave me , I command you . ’ “ Carlini obeyed , <unk> his comrades , folded himself in his cloak , and soon appeared to sleep as <unk> as the rest .
It had been resolved the night before to change their <unk> .
An hour before daybreak , Cucumetto aroused his men , and gave the word to march .
But Carlini would not quit the forest , without knowing what had become of <unk> ’ s father .
He went toward the place where he had left him .
He found the old man suspended from one of the branches of the <unk> which <unk> his daughter ’ s grave .
He then took an oath of bitter vengeance over the dead body of the one and the tomb of the other .
But he was unable to complete this oath , for two days afterwards , in an encounter with the Roman <unk> , Carlini was killed .
There was some surprise , however , that , as he was with his face to the enemy , he should have received a ball between his shoulders .
That astonishment ceased when one of the <unk> remarked to his comrades that Cucumetto was stationed ten paces in Carlini ’ s rear when he fell .
On the morning of the departure from the forest of <unk> he had followed Carlini in the darkness , and heard this oath of vengeance , and , like a wise man , anticipated it .
“ They told ten other stories of this bandit chief , each more singular than the other .
Thus , from <unk> to <unk> , everyone <unk> at the name of Cucumetto .
“ These <unk> were frequently the <unk> of conversation between Luigi and Teresa .
The young girl trembled very much at hearing the stories ; but Vampa reassured her with a smile , <unk> the <unk> of his good <unk> , which threw its ball so well ; and if that did not restore her courage , he pointed to a <unk> , <unk> on some dead branch , took aim , touched the <unk> , and the bird fell dead at the foot of the tree .
<unk> passed on , and the two young people had agreed to be married when Vampa should be twenty and Teresa nineteen years of age .
They were both <unk> , and had only their <unk> ’ leave to ask , which had been already sought and obtained .
One day when they were talking over their plans for the future , they heard two or three reports of <unk> , and then suddenly a man came out of the wood , near which the two young persons used to <unk> their <unk> , and hurried towards them .
When he came within hearing , he exclaimed : ‘ I am pursued ; can you conceal me ? ’ “ They knew full well that this <unk> must be a bandit ; but there is an <unk> sympathy between the Roman <unk> and the Roman peasant and the latter is always ready to aid the former .
Vampa , without saying a word , hastened to the stone that closed up the entrance to their grotto , drew it away , made a sign to the <unk> to take refuge there , in a retreat unknown to everyone , closed the stone upon him , and then went and resumed his seat by Teresa .
<unk> afterwards four <unk> , on horseback , appeared on the edge of the wood ; three of them appeared to be looking for the <unk> , while the fourth dragged a <unk> prisoner by the neck .
The three <unk> looked about carefully on every side , saw the young peasants , and <unk> up , began to question them .
They had seen no one .
“ ‘ That is very <unk> , ’ said the <unk> ; for the man we are looking for is the chief . ’ “ ‘ Cucumetto ? ’ cried Luigi and Teresa at the same moment .
“ ‘ Yes , ’ replied the <unk> ; ‘ and as his head is <unk> at a thousand Roman crowns , there would have been five hundred for you , if you had helped us to catch him . ’ The two young persons exchanged looks .
The <unk> had a moment ’ s hope .
Five hundred Roman crowns are three thousand <unk> , and three thousand <unk> are a fortune for two poor <unk> who are going to be married .
“ ‘ Yes , it is very <unk> , ’ said Vampa ; ‘ but we have not seen him . ’ “ Then the <unk> <unk> the country in different directions , but in vain ; then , after a time , they disappeared .
Vampa then removed the stone , and Cucumetto came out .
Through the <unk> in the granite he had seen the two young peasants talking with the <unk> , and guessed the subject of their <unk> .
He had read in the <unk> of Luigi and Teresa their <unk> resolution not to <unk> him , and he drew from his pocket a purse full of gold , which he offered to them .
But Vampa raised his head <unk> ; as to Teresa , her eyes <unk> when she thought of all the fine <unk> and gay <unk> she could buy with this purse of gold .
“ Cucumetto was a cunning fiend , and had assumed the form of a <unk> instead of a <unk> , and this look from Teresa showed to him that she was a worthy daughter of <unk> , and he returned to the forest , <unk> several times on his way , under the pretext of <unk> his <unk> .
“ <unk> days elapsed , and they neither saw nor heard of Cucumetto .
The time of the Carnival was at hand .
The Count of <unk> announced a grand masked ball , to which all that were distinguished in Rome were invited .
Teresa had a great desire to see this ball .
Luigi asked permission of his protector , the steward , that she and he might be present amongst the servants of the house .
This was granted .
The ball was given by the Count for the particular pleasure of his daughter <unk> , whom he adored .
<unk> was precisely the age and figure of Teresa , and Teresa was as handsome as <unk> .
On the evening of the ball Teresa was <unk> in her best , her most brilliant <unk> in her hair , and <unk> glass <unk> , — she was in the costume of the women of <unk> .
Luigi wore the very picturesque <unk> of the Roman peasant at <unk> time .
They both mingled , as they had leave to do , with the servants and peasants .
“ The _ <unk> _ was magnificent ; not only was the <unk> <unk> illuminated , but thousands of <unk> lanterns were suspended from the trees in the garden ; and very soon the palace <unk> to the <unk> , and the <unk> to the <unk> .
At each <unk> was an <unk> , and tables spread with <unk> ; the guests stopped , formed <unk> , and danced in any part of the grounds they pleased .
<unk> was <unk> like a woman of <unk> .
Her cap was embroidered with pearls , the <unk> in her hair were of gold and diamonds , her <unk> was of <unk> silk , with large embroidered flowers , her <unk> and <unk> were of <unk> , her <unk> of <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> of her <unk> were of jewels .
Two of her companions were dressed , the one as a woman of <unk> , and the other as a woman of La <unk> .
Four young men of the <unk> and <unk> families of Rome accompanied them with that Italian freedom which has not its <unk> in any other country in the world .
They were <unk> as peasants of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
We need hardly add that these peasant <unk> , like those of the young women , were brilliant with gold and jewels .
“ <unk> wished to form a <unk> , but there was one lady wanting .
<unk> looked all around her , but not one of the guests had a costume similar to her own , or those of her companions .
The Count of <unk> pointed out Teresa , who was hanging on Luigi ’ s arm in a group of peasants .
“ ‘ Will you allow me , father ? ’ said <unk> .
“ ‘ Certainly , ’ replied the count , ‘ are we not in Carnival time ? ’ “ <unk> turned towards the young man who was talking with her , and saying a few words to him , pointed with her finger to Teresa .
The young man looked , bowed in obedience , and then went to Teresa , and invited her to dance in a <unk> directed by the count ’ s daughter .
Teresa felt a <unk> pass over her face ; she looked at Luigi , who could not refuse his <unk> .
Luigi slowly <unk> Teresa ’ s arm , which he had held beneath his own , and Teresa , accompanied by her elegant <unk> , took her appointed place with much agitation in the <unk> <unk> .
Certainly , in the eyes of an artist , the exact and strict costume of Teresa had a very different character from that of <unk> and her companions ; and Teresa was <unk> and <unk> , and thus the <unk> and <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , all dazzled her , and the reflection of <unk> and diamonds almost turned her <unk> brain .
“ Luigi felt a sensation hitherto unknown <unk> in his mind .
It was like an <unk> pain which <unk> at his heart , and then <unk> through his whole body .
He followed with his eye each movement of Teresa and her <unk> ; when their hands touched , he felt as though he should <unk> ; every pulse beat with violence , and it seemed as though a bell were <unk> in his ears .
When they spoke , although Teresa listened <unk> and with <unk> eyes to the conversation of her <unk> , as Luigi could read in the ardent looks of the <unk> young man that his language was that of praise , it seemed as if the whole world was turning round with him , and all the voices of hell were whispering in his ears ideas of murder and <unk> .
Then fearing that his <unk> might get the better of him , he <unk> with one hand the branch of a tree against which he was leaning , and with the other convulsively grasped the <unk> with a <unk> handle which was in his <unk> , and which , <unk> , he drew from the <unk> from time to time .
“ Luigi was jealous !
“ He felt that , <unk> by her <unk> and <unk> disposition , Teresa might escape him .
“ The young peasant girl , at first timid and <unk> , soon recovered herself .
We have said that Teresa was handsome , but this is not all ; Teresa was <unk> with all those wild <unk> which are so much more <unk> than our affected and studied <unk> .
She had almost all the <unk> of the <unk> , and if she were <unk> of the Count of <unk> ’ s daughter , we will not <unk> to say that <unk> was not jealous of her .
And with <unk> compliments her handsome <unk> led her back to the place whence he had taken her , and where Luigi awaited her .
<unk> or <unk> during the dance the young girl had glanced at Luigi , and each time she saw that he was pale and that his features were agitated , once even the <unk> of his knife , half drawn from its <unk> , had dazzled her eyes with its sinister <unk> .
Thus , it was almost <unk> that she resumed her lover ’ s arm .
The <unk> had been most perfect , and it was evident there was a great demand for a <unk> , <unk> alone <unk> to it , but the Count of <unk> <unk> his daughter so earnestly , that she <unk> .
“ One of the <unk> then hastened to invite Teresa , without whom it was impossible for the <unk> to be formed , but the young girl had disappeared .
“ The truth was , that Luigi had not felt the strength to support another such trial , and , half by <unk> and half by force , he had removed Teresa toward another part of the garden .
Teresa had yielded in spite of herself , but when she looked at the agitated countenance of the young man , she understood by his silence and trembling voice that something strange was passing within him .
She herself was not exempt from <unk> emotion , and without having done anything wrong , yet fully comprehended that Luigi was right in <unk> her .
Why , she did not know , but yet she did not the less feel that these <unk> were <unk> .
“ However , to Teresa ’ s great astonishment , Luigi remained mute , and not a word escaped his lips the rest of the evening .
When the chill of the night had driven away the guests from the gardens , and the gates of the <unk> were closed on them for the _ <unk> _ <unk> , he took Teresa quite away , and as he left her at her home , he said : “ ‘ Teresa , what were you thinking of as you danced opposite the young <unk> of <unk> ? ’ “ ‘ I thought , ’ replied the young girl , with all the <unk> of her nature , ‘ that I would give half my life for a costume such as she wore . ’ “ ‘ And what said your <unk> to you ? ’ “ ‘ He said it only depended on myself to have it , and I had only one word to say . ’ “ ‘ He was right , ’ said Luigi .
‘ Do you desire it as <unk> as you say ? ’ “ ‘ Yes . ’ “ ‘ Well , then , you shall have it ! ’ “ The young girl , much astonished , raised her head to look at him , but his face was so gloomy and terrible that her words <unk> to her lips .
As Luigi spoke thus , he left her .
Teresa followed him with her eyes into the darkness as long as she could , and when he had quite disappeared , she went into the house with a sigh .
<unk> “ That night a <unk> event occurred , due , no doubt , to the <unk> of some servant who had neglected to <unk> the lights .
The <unk> of <unk> took fire in the rooms adjoining the very apartment of the lovely <unk> .
<unk> in the night by the light of the flames , she sprang out of bed , wrapped herself in a <unk> , and attempted to escape by the door , but the corridor by which she hoped to fly was already a prey to the flames .
She then returned to her room , calling for help as loudly as she could , when suddenly her window , which was twenty feet from the ground , was opened , a young peasant jumped into the chamber , seized her in his arms , and with <unk> skill and strength conveyed her to the <unk> of the <unk> , where she fainted .
When she recovered , her father was by her side .
All the servants surrounded her , offering her assistance .
An entire wing of the <unk> was burnt down ; but what of that , as long as <unk> was safe and <unk> ?
“ Her <unk> was everywhere sought for , but he did not appear ; he was inquired after , but no one had seen him .
<unk> was greatly troubled that she had not recognized him .
“ As the count was <unk> rich , excepting the danger <unk> had run , — and the marvellous manner in which she had escaped , made that appear to him rather a favor of Providence than a real misfortune , — the loss <unk> by the <unk> was to him but a trifle .
“ The next day , at the usual hour , the two young peasants were on the <unk> of the forest .
Luigi arrived first .
He came toward Teresa in high spirits , and seemed to have completely forgotten the events of the previous evening .
The young girl was very <unk> , but seeing Luigi so cheerful , she on her part assumed a smiling air , which was natural to her when she was not excited or in a passion .
“ Luigi took her arm beneath his own , and led her to the door of the grotto .
Then he paused .
The young girl , perceiving that there was something extraordinary , looked at him <unk> .
“ ‘ Teresa , ’ said Luigi , ‘ yesterday evening you told me you would give all the world to have a costume similar to that of the count ’ s daughter . ’ “ ‘ Yes , ’ replied Teresa with astonishment ; ‘ but I was mad to utter such a wish . ’ “ ‘ And I replied , “ Very well , you shall have it . ” ’ “ ‘ Yes , ’ replied the young girl , whose astonishment increased at every word uttered by Luigi , ‘ but of course your reply was only to please me . ’ “ ‘ I have promised no more than I have given you , Teresa , ’ said Luigi <unk> .
‘ Go into the grotto and dress yourself . ’ “ At these words he drew away the stone , and showed Teresa the grotto , lighted up by two wax lights , which burnt on each side of a splendid mirror ; on a <unk> table , made by Luigi , were spread out the <unk> <unk> and the diamond <unk> , and on a chair at the side was laid the rest of the costume .
“ Teresa uttered a cry of joy , and , without <unk> whence this <unk> came , or even <unk> Luigi , darted into the grotto , <unk> into a dressing-room .
“ Luigi pushed the stone behind her , for on the crest of a small <unk> hill which cut off the view toward <unk> , he saw a traveller on horseback , stopping a moment , as if <unk> of his road , and thus presenting against the blue sky that perfect <unk> which is peculiar to distant objects in <unk> <unk> .
When he saw Luigi , he put his horse into a <unk> and advanced toward him .
“ Luigi was not mistaken .
The traveller , who was going from <unk> to <unk> , had mistaken his way ; the young man directed him ; but as at a distance of a quarter of a mile the road again divided into three ways , and on reaching these the traveller might again <unk> from his <unk> , he begged Luigi to be his guide .
“ Luigi threw his cloak on the ground , placed his <unk> on his shoulder , and <unk> from his heavy <unk> , preceded the traveller with the rapid step of a <unk> , which a horse can scarcely keep up with .
In ten minutes Luigi and the traveller reached the <unk> .
On arriving there , with an air as <unk> as that of an emperor , he stretched his hand towards that one of the roads which the traveller was to follow .
“ ‘ That is your road , excellency , and now you cannot again mistake . ’ “ ‘ And here is your recompense , ’ said the traveller , offering the young <unk> some small pieces of money .
“ ‘ Thank you , ’ said Luigi , drawing back his hand ; ‘ I render a service , I do not sell it . ’ “ ‘ Well , ’ replied the traveller , who seemed used to this difference between the <unk> of a man of the <unk> and the pride of the <unk> , ‘ if you refuse <unk> , you will , perhaps , accept a gift . ’ “ ‘ Ah , yes , that is another thing . ’ “ ‘ Then , ’ said the traveller , ‘ take these two <unk> <unk> and give them to your bride , to make herself a pair of <unk> . ’ “ ‘ And then do you take this <unk> , ’ said the young <unk> ; ‘ you will not find one better <unk> between <unk> and <unk> . ’ “ ‘ I accept it , ’ answered the traveller , ‘ but then the <unk> will be on my side , for this <unk> is worth more than two <unk> . ’ “ ‘ For a <unk> perhaps ; but for me , who <unk> it myself , it is hardly worth a <unk> . ’ “ ‘ What is your name ? ’ inquired the traveller .
“ ‘ Luigi Vampa , ’ replied the shepherd , with the same air as he would have replied , Alexander , King of <unk> .
‘ And yours ? ’ “ ‘ I , ’ said the traveller , ‘ am called Sinbad the <unk> . ’ ” Franz d ’ Épinay started with surprise .
“ Sinbad the <unk> ? ” he said .
“ Yes , ” replied the <unk> ; “ that was the name which the traveller gave to Vampa as his own . ” “ Well , and what may you have to say against this name ? ” inquired Albert ; “ it is a very pretty name , and the adventures of the gentleman of that name amused me very much in my youth , I must confess . ” Franz said no more .
The name of Sinbad the <unk> , as may well be supposed , awakened in him a world of recollections , as had the name of the Count of Monte Cristo on the previous evening .
“ <unk> ! ” said he to the host .
“ Vampa put the two <unk> <unk> into his pocket , and slowly returned by the way he had gone .
As he came within two or three hundred paces of the grotto , he thought he heard a cry .
He listened to know whence this sound could proceed .
A moment afterwards he thought he heard his own name pronounced distinctly .
“ The cry proceeded from the grotto .
He bounded like a <unk> , <unk> his <unk> as he went , and in a moment reached the summit of a hill opposite to that on which he had perceived the traveller .
Three cries for help came more distinctly to his ear .
He cast his eyes around him and saw a man carrying off Teresa , as <unk> , the <unk> , carried <unk> .
“ This man , who was <unk> towards the wood , was already <unk> of the way on the road from the grotto to the forest .
Vampa measured the distance ; the man was at least two hundred paces in advance of him , and there was not a chance of <unk> him .
The young shepherd stopped , as if his feet had been <unk> to the ground ; then he put the <unk> of his <unk> to his shoulder , took aim at the <unk> , followed him for a second in his track , and then fired .
“ The <unk> stopped suddenly , his knees bent under him , and he fell with Teresa in his arms .
The young girl rose instantly , but the man lay on the earth <unk> in the <unk> of death .
Vampa then rushed towards Teresa ; for at ten paces from the dying man her legs had failed her , and she had dropped on her knees , so that the young man feared that the ball that had brought down his enemy , had also wounded his betrothed .
“ Fortunately , she was <unk> , and it was fright alone that had overcome Teresa .
When Luigi had assured himself that she was safe and <unk> , he turned towards the wounded man .
He had just <unk> , with clenched hands , his mouth in a <unk> of agony , and his hair on end in the <unk> of death .
His eyes remained open and <unk> .
Vampa approached the corpse , and recognized Cucumetto .
“ From the day on which the bandit had been saved by the two young peasants , he had been <unk> of Teresa , and had <unk> she should be his .
From that time he had watched them , and <unk> by the moment when her lover had left her alone , had carried her off , and believed he at length had her in his power , when the ball , directed by the <unk> skill of the young <unk> , had pierced his heart .
Vampa gazed on him for a moment without <unk> the slightest emotion ; while , on the contrary , Teresa , shuddering in every <unk> , dared not approach the <unk> <unk> but by degrees , and threw a <unk> glance at the dead body over the shoulder of her lover .
Suddenly Vampa turned toward his mistress : “ ‘ Ah , ’ said he — ‘ good , good !
You are dressed ; it is now my turn to dress myself . ’ <unk> “ Teresa was clothed from head to foot in the <unk> of the Count of <unk> ’ s daughter .
Vampa took Cucumetto ’ s body in his arms and conveyed it to the grotto , while in her turn Teresa remained outside .
If a second traveller had passed , he would have seen a strange thing , — a <unk> watching her <unk> , clad in a <unk> grown , with <unk> and <unk> of pearls , diamond <unk> , and <unk> of <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
He would , no doubt , have believed that he had returned to the times of <unk> , and would have declared , on reaching Paris , that he had met an <unk> <unk> seated at the foot of the <unk> Hill .
“ At the end of a quarter of an hour Vampa quitted the grotto ; his costume was no less elegant than that of Teresa .
He wore a <unk> of <unk> velvet , with <unk> of cut gold ; a silk waistcoat covered with <unk> ; a Roman <unk> tied round his neck ; a <unk> worked with gold , and red and green silk ; <unk> velvet <unk> , fastened above the knee with diamond <unk> ; <unk> of <unk> , worked with a thousand <unk> , and a hat <unk> hung <unk> of all colors ; two <unk> hung from his <unk> , and a splendid <unk> was in his <unk> .
“ Teresa uttered a cry of admiration .
Vampa in this <unk> resembled a <unk> by <unk> Robert or <unk> .
He had assumed the entire costume of Cucumetto .
The young man saw the effect produced on his betrothed , and a smile of pride passed over his lips .
“ ‘ Now , ’ he said to Teresa , ‘ are you ready to share my fortune , whatever it may be ? ’ “ ‘ Oh , yes ! ’ exclaimed the young girl <unk> .
“ ‘ And follow me wherever I go ? ’ “ ‘ To the world ’ s end . ’ “ ‘ Then take my arm , and let us on ; we have no time to lose . ’ “ The young girl did so without <unk> her lover as to where he was <unk> her , for he appeared to her at this moment as handsome , proud , and powerful as a <unk> .
They went towards the forest , and soon entered it .
“ We need scarcely say that all the paths of the mountain were known to Vampa ; he therefore went forward without a moment ’ s hesitation , although there was no beaten track , but he knew his path by looking at the trees and <unk> , and thus they kept on advancing for nearly an hour and a half .
At the end of this time they had reached the <unk> part of the forest .
A <unk> , whose bed was dry , led into a deep <unk> .
Vampa took this wild road , which , <unk> between two <unk> , and <unk> by the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> , seemed , but for the difficulties of its descent , that path to <unk> of which <unk> speaks .
Teresa had become alarmed at the wild and deserted look of the plain around her , and pressed closely against her guide , not uttering a syllable ; but as she saw him advance with even step and composed countenance , she endeavored to <unk> her emotion .
“ Suddenly , about ten paces from them , a man advanced from behind a tree and <unk> at Vampa .
“ ‘ Not another step , ’ he said , ‘ or you are a dead man . ’ “ ‘ What , then , ’ said Vampa , raising his hand with a gesture of disdain , while Teresa , no longer able to restrain her alarm , clung closely to him , ‘ do wolves <unk> each other ? ’ “ ‘ Who are you ? ’ inquired the sentinel .
“ ‘ I am Luigi Vampa , shepherd of the <unk> farm . ’ “ ‘ What do you want ? ’ “ ‘ I would speak with your companions who are in the <unk> at <unk> <unk> . ’ “ ‘ <unk> me , then , ’ said the sentinel ; ‘ or , as you know your way , go first . ’ “ Vampa smiled <unk> at this precaution on the part of the bandit , went before Teresa , and continued to advance with the same firm and easy step as before .
At the end of ten minutes the bandit made them a sign to stop .
The two young persons obeyed .
Then the bandit <unk> <unk> the cry of a <unk> ; a <unk> answered this signal .
“ ‘ Good ! ’ said the <unk> , ‘ you may now go on . ’ “ Luigi and Teresa again set forward ; as they went on Teresa clung <unk> to her lover at the sight of weapons and the <unk> of <unk> through the trees .
The retreat of <unk> <unk> was at the top of a small mountain , which no doubt in former days had been a <unk> — an <unk> <unk> before the days when <unk> and <unk> had deserted <unk> to come and found the city of Rome .
“ Teresa and Luigi reached the summit , and all at once found themselves in the presence of twenty bandits .
“ ‘ Here is a young man who <unk> and wishes to speak to you , ’ said the sentinel .
“ ‘ What has he to say ? ’ inquired the young man who was in command in the chief ’ s absence .
“ ‘ I wish to say that I am tired of a shepherd ’ s life , ’ was Vampa ’ s reply .
“ ‘ Ah , I understand , ’ said the <unk> ; ‘ and you seek <unk> into our ranks ? ’ “ ‘ <unk> ! ’ cried several bandits from <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , who had recognized Luigi Vampa .
“ ‘ Yes , but I came to ask something more than to be your companion . ’ “ ‘ And what may that be ? ’ inquired the bandits with astonishment .
“ ‘ I come to ask to be your captain , ’ said the young man .
“ The bandits shouted with laughter .
“ ‘ And what have you done to <unk> to this honor ? ’ demanded the <unk> .
“ ‘ I have killed your chief , Cucumetto , whose dress I now wear ; and I set fire to the <unk> <unk> to procure a <unk> for my betrothed . ’ “ An hour afterwards Luigi Vampa was chosen captain , vice Cucumetto , <unk> . ” <unk> “ Well , my dear Albert , ” said Franz , turning towards his friend ; “ what think you of citizen Luigi Vampa ? ” “ I say he is a <unk> , ” replied Albert , “ and never had an existence . ” “ And what may a <unk> be ? ” inquired Pastrini .
“ The explanation would be too long , my dear landlord , ” replied Franz .
“ And you say that Signor Vampa <unk> his profession at this moment in the <unk> of Rome ? ” “ And with a <unk> of which no bandit before him ever gave an example . ” “ Then the police have <unk> tried to lay hands on him ? ” “ Why , you see , he has a good understanding with the <unk> in the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , and the smugglers of the coast .
They seek for him in the mountains , and he is on the waters ; they follow him on the waters , and he is on the open sea ; then they pursue him , and he has suddenly taken refuge in the <unk> , at <unk> , <unk> , or Monte Cristo ; and when they <unk> for him there , he <unk> suddenly at <unk> , <unk> , or La <unk> . ” “ And how does he <unk> towards travellers ? ” “ Alas !
his plan is very simple .
It depends on the distance he may be from the city , whether he gives eight hours , twelve hours , or a day <unk> to pay their <unk> ; and when that time has elapsed he <unk> another hour ’ s grace .
At the <unk> minute of this hour , if the money is not <unk> , he blows out the prisoner ’ s brains with a <unk> , or plants his <unk> in his heart , and that <unk> the account . ” “ Well , Albert , ” inquired Franz of his companion , “ are you still disposed to go to the Colosseum by the outer wall ? ” “ Quite so , ” said Albert , “ if the way be picturesque . ” The clock struck nine as the door opened , and a coachman appeared .
“ <unk> , ” said he , “ the coach is ready . ” “ Well , then , ” said Franz , “ let us to the Colosseum . ” “ By the <unk> del <unk> or by the streets , your <unk> ? ” “ By the streets , _ <unk> ! _ by the streets ! ” cried Franz .
“ Ah , my dear fellow , ” said Albert , rising , and <unk> his third <unk> , “ really , I thought you had more courage . ” So saying , the two young men went down the staircase , and got into the carriage .
<unk> Chapter <unk> .
The Colosseum Franz had so managed his <unk> , that during the ride to the Colosseum they passed not a single ancient ruin , so that no <unk> impression <unk> to <unk> the colossal <unk> of the gigantic building they came to admire .
The road selected was a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> ; then by cutting off the right angle of the street in which stands <unk> Maria <unk> and proceeding by the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> in <unk> , the travellers would find themselves directly opposite the Colosseum .
This <unk> possessed another great advantage , — that of leaving Franz at full liberty to indulge his deep reverie upon the subject of Signor Pastrini ’ s story , in which his mysterious host of Monte Cristo was so strangely mixed up .
<unk> with folded arms in a corner of the carriage , he continued to <unk> over the singular history he had so lately listened to , and to ask himself an <unk> number of questions touching its various circumstances without , however , arriving at a <unk> reply to any of them .
One fact more than the rest brought his friend “ Sinbad the <unk> ” back to his recollection , and that was the mysterious sort of intimacy that seemed to exist between the <unk> and the sailors ; and Pastrini ’ s account of Vampa ’ s having found refuge on board the <unk> of smugglers and <unk> , reminded Franz of the two Corsican bandits he had found <unk> so <unk> with the crew of the little yacht , which had even <unk> from its course and touched at <unk> for the sole purpose of landing them .
The very name assumed by his host of Monte Cristo and again repeated by the landlord of the Hôtel de <unk> , <unk> proved to him that his island friend was playing his <unk> part on the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , as on those of Corsica , <unk> , and Spain ; and further , Franz <unk> him of having heard his singular <unk> speak both of <unk> and <unk> , <unk> <unk> how <unk> his circle of <unk> extended .
But however the mind of the young man might be absorbed in these reflections , they were at once <unk> at the sight of the dark <unk> ruins of the <unk> Colosseum , through the various <unk> of which the pale moonlight played and <unk> like the <unk> gleam from the eyes of the wandering dead .
The carriage stopped near the <unk> <unk> ; the door was opened , and the young men , eagerly <unk> , found themselves opposite a _ <unk> _ , who appeared to have sprung up from the ground , so unexpected was his appearance .
The usual guide from the hotel having followed them , they had paid two <unk> , nor is it possible , at Rome , to avoid this <unk> supply of <unk> ; besides the ordinary _ <unk> _ , who <unk> upon you directly you set foot in your hotel , and never <unk> you while you remain in the city , there is also a special _ <unk> _ belonging to each <unk> — nay , almost to each part of a <unk> .
It may , therefore , be easily imagined there is no <unk> of <unk> at the Colosseum , that wonder of all <unk> , which <unk> thus <unk> : “ Let <unk> cease to boast the <unk> <unk> of her <unk> , and the <unk> of <unk> be talked of no more among us ; all must bow to the superiority of the gigantic labor of the <unk> , and the many voices of <unk> spread far and wide the <unk> <unk> of this <unk> <unk> . ” As for Albert and Franz , they <unk> not to escape from their _ <unk> _ <unk> ; and , indeed , it would have been so much the more difficult to break their <unk> , as the <unk> alone are permitted to visit these <unk> with <unk> in their hands .
Thus , then , the young men made no attempt at resistance , but <unk> and <unk> <unk> themselves into the care and <unk> of their <unk> .
Franz had already made seven or eight similar <unk> to the Colosseum , while his less <unk> companion <unk> for the first time in his life the <unk> ground forming the <unk> of <unk> <unk> ; and , to his credit be it spoken , his mind , even amid the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> , was <unk> and deeply touched with <unk> and enthusiastic admiration of all he saw ; and certainly no <unk> <unk> of these <unk> ruins can be formed save by such as have visited them , and more especially by moonlight , at which time the vast <unk> of the building appear twice as large when viewed by the mysterious <unk> of a <unk> <unk> sky , whose rays are sufficiently clear and <unk> to light the horizon with a glow equal to the soft twilight of a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , therefore , had the <unk> Franz walked a hundred steps beneath the interior <unk> of the ruin , when , <unk> Albert to the <unk> ( who would by no means yield their <unk> right of carrying their <unk> through the <unk> <unk> laid down , and as <unk> followed by them , but dragged the unconscious visitor to the various objects with a <unk> that admitted of no appeal , beginning , as a matter of course , with the “ <unk> ’ <unk> ” , the “ <unk> of the <unk> ” and <unk> with “ Cæsar ’ s <unk> ” ) , to escape a <unk> and <unk> <unk> of the <unk> by which he was surrounded , Franz ascended a <unk> staircase , and , leaving them to follow their <unk> round , seated himself at the foot of a column , and immediately opposite a large aperture , which permitted him to enjoy a full and <unk> view of the gigantic <unk> of the <unk> ruin .
Franz had remained for nearly a quarter of an hour perfectly hidden by the shadow of the vast column at whose base he had found a <unk> , and from whence his eyes followed the <unk> of Albert and his <unk> , who , holding <unk> in their hands , had emerged from a <unk> at the opposite extremity of the Colosseum , and then again disappeared down the steps <unk> to the <unk> reserved for the <unk> <unk> , resembling , as they <unk> along , some <unk> shades following the <unk> <unk> of so many _ <unk> <unk> _ .
All at once his ear caught a sound resembling that of a stone rolling down the staircase opposite the one by which he had himself ascended .
There was nothing remarkable in the circumstance of a fragment of granite giving way and falling heavily below ; but it seemed to him that the substance that fell gave way beneath the pressure of a foot , and also that someone , who endeavored as much as possible to prevent his footsteps from being heard , was approaching the spot where he sat .
<unk> soon became certainty , for the figure of a man was distinctly visible to Franz , gradually <unk> from the staircase opposite , upon which the moon was at that moment <unk> a full tide of <unk> <unk> .
The stranger thus presenting himself was probably a person who , like Franz , preferred the enjoyment of solitude and his own thoughts to the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> .
And his appearance had nothing extraordinary in it ; but the hesitation with which he proceeded , stopping and listening with anxious attention at every step he took , convinced Franz that he expected the arrival of some person .
By a sort of <unk> impulse , Franz withdrew as much as possible behind his <unk> .
About ten feet from the spot where he and the stranger were , the roof had given way , leaving a large round opening , through which might be seen the blue vault of heaven , <unk> <unk> with stars .
<unk> this opening , which had , possibly , for <unk> permitted a free entrance to the brilliant <unk> that now <unk> the vast pile , grew a quantity of <unk> plants , whose delicate green branches stood out in bold relief against the clear azure of the <unk> , while large masses of thick , strong <unk> <unk> forced their way through the <unk> , and hung floating to and fro , like so many <unk> <unk> .
The person whose mysterious arrival had attracted the attention of Franz stood in a kind of <unk> , that rendered it impossible to distinguish his features , although his dress was easily made out .
He wore a large brown mantle , one fold of which , thrown over his left shoulder , served likewise to mask the lower part of his countenance , while the upper part was completely hidden by his <unk> hat .
The lower part of his dress was more distinctly visible by the bright rays of the moon , which , entering through the broken ceiling , shed their <unk> <unk> on feet <unk> in <unk> made boots of polished leather , over which descended <unk> cut trousers of black cloth .
<unk> From the <unk> means Franz had of <unk> , he could only come to one conclusion , — that the person whom he was thus watching certainly belonged to no inferior station of life .
Some few minutes had elapsed , and the stranger began to show <unk> signs of impatience , when a slight noise was heard outside the aperture in the roof , and almost immediately a dark shadow seemed to <unk> the <unk> of light that had entered it , and the figure of a man was clearly seen gazing with eager <unk> on the immense space beneath him ; then , as his eye caught sight of him in the mantle , he grasped a floating mass of <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> down by their help to within three or four feet of the ground , and then leaped lightly on his feet .
The man who had performed this daring act with so much indifference wore the <unk> costume .
“ I beg your excellency ’ s pardon for keeping you waiting , ” said the man , in the Roman <unk> , “ but I don ’ t think I ’ m many minutes after my time , ten o ’ clock has just struck by the clock of Saint John <unk> . ” “ Say not a word about being late , ” replied the stranger in <unk> <unk> ; “ ’ <unk> I who am too soon .
But even if you had caused me to wait a little while , I should have felt quite sure that the delay was not <unk> by any fault of yours . ” “ Your excellency is perfectly right in so thinking , ” said the man ; “ I came here direct from the <unk> of St. <unk> , and I had an immense deal of trouble before I could get a chance to speak to <unk> . ” “ And who is <unk> ? ” “ Oh , <unk> is employed in the prison , and I give him so much a year to let me know what is going on within his <unk> ’ s castle . ” “ Indeed !
You are a <unk> person , I see . ” “ Why , you see , no one knows what may happen .
Perhaps some of these days I may be <unk> , like poor Peppino and may be very glad to have some little <unk> <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of my <unk> , and so help me out of prison . ” “ <unk> , what did you learn ? ” “ That two <unk> of considerable interest will take place the day after tomorrow at two o ’ clock , as is <unk> at Rome at the <unk> of all great <unk> .
One of the <unk> will be _ <unk> _ ; 3 he is an <unk> <unk> , who murdered the priest who brought him up , and <unk> not the smallest pity .
The other <unk> is <unk> to be _ <unk> _ ; 4 and he , your excellency , is poor Peppino . ” “ The fact is , that you have inspired not only the <unk> government , but also the neighboring states , with such extreme fear , that they are glad of all opportunity of making an example . ” “ But Peppino did not even belong to my band ; he was merely a poor shepherd , whose only crime consisted in <unk> us with provisions . ” “ Which makes him your <unk> to all <unk> and <unk> .
But mark the distinction with which he is treated ; instead of being knocked on the head as you would be if once they caught hold of you , he is simply <unk> to be <unk> , by which means , too , the <unk> of the day are <unk> , and there is a spectacle to please every <unk> . ” “ Without <unk> the wholly unexpected one I am preparing to surprise them with . ” “ My good friend , ” said the man in the cloak , “ excuse me for saying that you seem to me precisely in the <unk> to commit some wild or <unk> act . ” “ Perhaps I am ; but one thing I have resolved on , and that is , to stop at nothing to restore a poor devil to liberty , who has got into this <unk> <unk> from having served me .
I should hate and <unk> myself as a coward did I desert the brave fellow in his present extremity . ” “ And what do you mean to do ? ” “ To <unk> the scaffold with twenty of my best men , who , at a signal from me , will rush forward directly Peppino is brought for execution , and , by the assistance of their <unk> , drive back the guard , and carry off the prisoner . ” “ That seems to me as <unk> as <unk> , and <unk> me that my scheme is far better than yours . ” “ And what is your excellency ’ s project ? ” “ Just this .
I will so <unk> bestow <unk> piastres , that the person receiving them shall obtain a <unk> till next year for Peppino ; and during that year , another <unk> placed <unk> piastres will afford him the means of <unk> from his prison . ” “ And do you feel sure of <unk> ? ” “ _ <unk> ! _ ” exclaimed the man in the cloak , suddenly expressing himself in French .
“ What did your excellency say ? ” inquired the other .
“ I said , my good fellow , that I would do more <unk> by the means of gold than you and all your <unk> could effect with <unk> , pistols , <unk> , and <unk> included .
Leave me , then , to act , and have no fears for the result . ” “ At least , there can be no harm in myself and party being in readiness , in case your excellency should fail . ” “ None whatever .
Take what precautions you please , if it is any satisfaction to you to do so ; but rely upon my obtaining the <unk> I seek . ” “ Remember , the execution is fixed for the day after tomorrow , and that you have but one day to work in . ” “ And what of that ?
Is not a day divided into <unk> hours , each hour into sixty minutes , and every minute <unk> into sixty seconds ?
Now in <unk> seconds very many things can be done . ” “ And how shall I know whether your excellency has succeeded or not . ” “ Oh , that is very easily arranged .
I have engaged the three lower windows at the Café <unk> ; should I have obtained the requisite pardon for Peppino , the two outside windows will be hung with yellow <unk> , and the centre with white , having a large cross in red marked on it . ” “ And whom will you <unk> to carry the <unk> to the officer <unk> the execution ? ” “ <unk> one of your men , <unk> as a <unk> <unk> , and I will give it to him .
His dress will procure him the means of approaching the scaffold itself , and he will deliver the official order to the officer , who , in his turn , will hand it to the executioner ; in the meantime , it will be as well to <unk> Peppino with what we have determined on , if it be only to prevent his dying of fear or losing his senses , because in either case a very useless expense will have been <unk> . ” “ Your excellency , ” said the man , “ you are fully persuaded of my entire devotion to you , are you not ? ” “ Nay , I <unk> myself that there can be no doubt of it , ” replied the <unk> in the cloak .
“ Well , then , only fulfil your promise of <unk> Peppino , and <unk> you shall receive not only devotion , but the most absolute obedience from myself and those under me that one human being can render to another . ” “ Have a care how far you <unk> yourself , my good friend , for I may remind you of your promise at some , perhaps , not very distant period , when I , in my turn , may require your aid and influence . ” “ Let that day come sooner or later , your excellency will find me what I have found you in this my heavy trouble ; and if from the other end of the world you but write me word to do such or such a thing , you may regard it as done , for done it shall be , on the word and faith of — — ” “ Hush ! ” interrupted the stranger ; “ I hear a noise . ” “ ’ Tis some travellers , who are visiting the Colosseum by <unk> . ” “ ’ <unk> better we should not be seen together ; those <unk> are nothing but <unk> , and might possibly recognize you ; and , however I may be <unk> by your friendship , my worthy friend , if once the extent of our intimacy were known , I am sadly afraid both my reputation and credit would suffer <unk> . ” “ Well , then , if you obtain the <unk> ? ” “ The middle window at the Café <unk> will be hung with white damask , bearing a red cross . ” “ And if you fail ? ” “ Then all three windows will have yellow <unk> . ” “ And then ? ” “ And then , my good fellow , use your <unk> in any way you please , and I further promise you to be there as a <unk> of your <unk> . ” “ We understand each other perfectly , then .
Adieu , your excellency ; depend upon me as firmly as I do upon you . ” <unk> these words , the <unk> disappeared down the staircase , while his companion , <unk> his features more closely than before in the folds of his mantle , passed almost close to Franz , and descended to the <unk> by an <unk> flight of steps .
The next minute Franz heard himself called by Albert , who made the lofty building <unk> with the sound of his friend ’ s name .
Franz , however , did not obey the <unk> till he had satisfied himself that the two men whose conversation he had <unk> were at a sufficient distance to prevent his <unk> them in his descent .
In ten minutes after the strangers had departed , Franz was on the road to the Piazza <unk> <unk> , listening with studied indifference to the learned <unk> delivered by Albert , after the manner of <unk> and <unk> , touching the <unk> <unk> used to prevent the ferocious <unk> from <unk> on the spectators .
Franz let him proceed without <unk> , and , in fact , did not hear what was said ; he longed to be alone , and free to <unk> over all that had occurred .
One of the two men , whose mysterious meeting in the Colosseum he had so <unk> witnessed , was an entire stranger to him , but not so the other ; and though Franz had been unable to distinguish his features , from his being either wrapped in his mantle or <unk> by the shadow , the tones of his voice had made too powerful an impression on him the first time he had heard them for him ever again to forget them , hear them when or where he might .
It was more especially when this man was speaking in a manner half <unk> , half bitter , that Franz ’ s ear recalled most <unk> the deep <unk> , yet <unk> voice that had addressed him in the grotto of Monte Cristo , and which he heard for the second time amid the darkness and ruined grandeur of the Colosseum .
And the more he thought , the more entire was his conviction , that the person who wore the mantle was no other than his former host and <unk> , “ Sinbad the <unk> . ” <unk> Under any other circumstances , Franz would have found it impossible to resist his extreme curiosity to know more of so singular a personage , and with that <unk> have sought to <unk> their short acquaintance ; but in the present instance , the <unk> nature of the conversation he had <unk> made him , with <unk> , judge that his appearance at such a time would be anything but agreeable .
As we have seen , therefore , he permitted his former host to retire without <unk> a <unk> , but fully <unk> himself a rich <unk> for his present <unk> should chance afford him another opportunity .
In vain did Franz endeavor to forget the many <unk> thoughts which <unk> him ; in vain did he court the <unk> of sleep .
<unk> refused to visit his eyelids and the night was passed in feverish contemplation of the chain of circumstances <unk> to prove the identity of the mysterious <unk> to the Colosseum with the <unk> of the grotto of Monte Cristo ; and the more he thought , the <unk> grew his opinion on the subject .
<unk> out at length , he fell asleep at daybreak , and did not awake till late .
Like a genuine Frenchman , Albert had employed his time in arranging for the evening ’ s <unk> ; he had sent to engage a box at the <unk> <unk> ; and Franz , having a number of letters to write , <unk> the carriage to Albert for the whole of the day .
At five o ’ clock Albert returned , delighted with his day ’ s work ; he had been occupied in leaving his letters of introduction , and had received in return more <unk> to balls and <unk> than it would be possible for him to accept ; besides this , he had seen ( as he called it ) all the remarkable <unk> at Rome .
Yes , in a single day he had accomplished what his more <unk> companion would have taken weeks to effect .
Neither had he neglected to ascertain the name of the piece to be played that night at the <unk> <unk> , and also what <unk> appeared in it .
The <unk> of _ <unk> _ was announced for <unk> , and the principal <unk> were <unk> , <unk> , and La <unk> .
The young men , therefore , had reason to consider themselves fortunate in having the opportunity of hearing one of the best works by the <unk> of _ <unk> <unk> <unk> _ , supported by three of the most <unk> <unk> of Italy .
Albert had never been able to endure the Italian <unk> , with their <unk> from which it is impossible to see , and the absence of <unk> , or open boxes ; all these <unk> pressed hard on a man who had had his <unk> at the <unk> , and had shared a lower box at the Opera .
Still , in spite of this , Albert displayed his most dazzling and <unk> <unk> each time he visited the <unk> ; but , alas , his elegant toilet was wholly thrown away , and one of the most worthy <unk> of Parisian fashion had to carry with him the <unk> reflection that he had nearly <unk> Italy without meeting with a single adventure .
Sometimes Albert would affect to make a joke of his want of success ; but <unk> he was deeply wounded , and his <unk> <unk> <unk> , to think that Albert de Morcerf , the most admired and most sought after of any young person of his day , should thus be passed over , and merely have his labor for his pains .
And the thing was so much the more <unk> , as , according to the characteristic modesty of a Frenchman , Albert had quitted Paris with the full conviction that he had only to show himself in Italy to carry all before him , and that upon his return he should <unk> the Parisian world with the <unk> of his numerous <unk> .
Alas , poor Albert !
None of those interesting adventures fell in his way ; the lovely <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> were all faithful , if not to their <unk> , at least to their lovers , and thought not of changing even for the splendid appearance of Albert de Morcerf ; and all he gained was the painful conviction that the ladies of Italy have this advantage over those of France , that they are faithful even in their <unk> .
Yet he could not restrain a hope that in Italy , as elsewhere , there might be an exception to the general rule .
Albert , besides being an elegant , <unk> young man , was also possessed of considerable talent and <unk> ; moreover , he was a viscount — a recently created one , certainly , but in the present day it is not necessary to go as far back as <unk> in <unk> a descent , and a <unk> tree is equally <unk> , whether <unk> from <unk> or merely 1815 ; but to crown all these advantages , Albert de Morcerf commanded an income of <unk> livres , a more than sufficient sum to render him a personage of considerable importance in Paris .
It was therefore no small <unk> to him to have visited most of the principal <unk> in Italy without having excited the most trifling observation .
Albert , however , hoped to <unk> himself for all these <unk> and <unk> during the Carnival , knowing full well that among the different states and <unk> in which this <unk> is celebrated , Rome is the spot where even the <unk> and <unk> throw off the usual <unk> of their lives , and <unk> to <unk> in the <unk> of this time of liberty and <unk> .
The Carnival was to <unk> on the morrow ; therefore Albert had not an instant to lose in setting forth the <unk> of his hopes , <unk> , and claims to notice .
With this design he had engaged a box in the most <unk> part of the theatre , and <unk> himself to set off his personal <unk> by the aid of the most rich and <unk> toilet .
The box taken by Albert was in the first circle ; although each of the three <unk> of boxes is <unk> equally <unk> , and is , for this reason , generally <unk> the “ nobility ’ s boxes , ” and although the box engaged for the two friends was sufficiently <unk> to contain at least a dozen persons , it had cost less than would be paid at some of the French <unk> for one <unk> merely four <unk> .
Another motive had <unk> Albert ’ s <unk> of his seat , — who knew but that , thus <unk> placed , he might not in truth attract the notice of some fair Roman , and an introduction might <unk> that would procure him the offer of a seat in a carriage , or a place in a <unk> <unk> , from which he might behold the <unk> of the Carnival ?
These united <unk> made Albert more lively and anxious to please than he had hitherto been .
<unk> <unk> the business of the stage , he leaned from his box and began attentively <unk> the beauty of each pretty woman , <unk> by a powerful <unk> ; but , alas , this attempt to attract notice wholly failed ; not even curiosity had been excited , and it was but too apparent that the lovely creatures , into whose good <unk> he was desirous of <unk> , were all so much <unk> with themselves , their lovers , or their own thoughts , that they had not so much as noticed him or the <unk> of his glass .
The truth was , that the anticipated pleasures of the Carnival , with the “ Holy <unk> ” that was to succeed it , so filled every fair breast , as to prevent the least attention being bestowed even on the business of the stage .
The <unk> made their <unk> and <unk> <unk> or <unk> of ; at certain <unk> moments , the spectators would suddenly cease their conversation , or <unk> themselves from their <unk> , to listen to some brilliant effort of <unk> ’ s , a <unk> <unk> by <unk> , or to join in loud <unk> at the wonderful powers of La <unk> ; but that momentary excitement over , they quickly <unk> into their former state of <unk> or interesting conversation .
Towards the close of the first act , the door of a box which had been hitherto <unk> was opened ; a lady entered to whom Franz had been introduced in Paris , where indeed , he had imagined she still was .
The quick eye of Albert caught the <unk> start with which his friend beheld the new arrival , and , turning to him , he said hastily : “ Do you know the woman who has just entered that box ? ” “ Yes ; what do you think of her ? ” “ Oh , she is perfectly lovely — what a complexion !
And such magnificent hair !
Is she French ? ” “ No ; a <unk> . ” “ And her name is — — ” “ <unk> G — — . ” “ Ah , I know her by name ! ” exclaimed Albert ; “ she is said to possess as much wit and <unk> as beauty .
I was to have been presented to her when I met her at Madame Villefort ’ s ball . ” “ Shall I assist you in <unk> your <unk> ? ” asked Franz .
“ My dear fellow , are you really on such good terms with her as to venture to take me to her box ? ” “ Why , I have only had the honor of being in her society and conversing with her three or four times in my life ; but you know that even such an acquaintance as that might <unk> my doing what you ask . ” At that instant , the countess perceived Franz , and <unk> <unk> her hand to him , to which he replied by a respectful inclination of the head .
“ Upon my word , ” said Albert , “ you seem to be on excellent terms with the beautiful countess . ” “ You are mistaken in thinking so , ” returned Franz calmly ; “ but you merely fall into the same error which leads so many of our <unk> to commit the most <unk> <unk> , — I mean that of <unk> the habits and customs of Italy and Spain by our Parisian <unk> ; believe me , nothing is more <unk> than to form any <unk> of the degree of intimacy you may suppose <unk> among persons by the familiar terms they seem upon ; there is a <unk> of feeling at this instant between ourselves and the countess — nothing more . ” “ Is there , indeed , my good fellow ?
Pray tell me , is it sympathy of heart ? ” “ No ; of taste , ” continued Franz gravely .
“ And in what manner has this <unk> of mind been <unk> ? ” “ By the countess ’ s visiting the Colosseum , as we did last night , by moonlight , and nearly alone . ” “ You were with her , then ? ” “ I was . ” “ And what did you say to her ? ” “ Oh , we talked of the illustrious dead of whom that magnificent ruin is a <unk> <unk> ! ” “ Upon my word , ” cried Albert , “ you must have been a very <unk> companion alone , or all but alone , with a beautiful woman in such a place of sentiment as the Colosseum , and yet to find nothing better to talk about than the dead !
All I can say is , if ever I should get such a chance , the living should be my <unk> . ” <unk> “ And you will probably find your <unk> <unk> . ” “ But , ” said Albert , breaking in upon his <unk> , “ never mind the past ; let us only remember the present .
Are you not going to keep your promise of <unk> me to the fair subject of our remarks ? ” “ Certainly , directly the curtain falls on the stage . ” “ What a <unk> long time this first act <unk> .
I believe , on my soul , that they never mean to finish it . ” “ Oh , yes , they will ; only listen to that charming <unk> .
How <unk> <unk> <unk> his part . ” “ But what an awkward , <unk> fellow he is . ” “ Well , then , what do you say to La <unk> ?
Did you ever see anything more perfect than her acting ? ” “ Why , you know , my dear fellow , when one has been accustomed to <unk> and <unk> , such <unk> as these don ’ t make the same impression on you they perhaps do on others . ” “ At least , you must admire <unk> ’ s style and execution . ” “ I never fancied men of his dark , <unk> appearance singing with a voice like a woman ’ s . ” “ My good friend , ” said Franz , turning to him , while Albert continued to point his glass at every box in the theatre , “ you seem determined not to approve ; you are really too difficult to please . ” The curtain at length fell on the <unk> , to the infinite satisfaction of the <unk> of Morcerf , who seized his hat , rapidly passed his fingers through his hair , arranged his cravat and <unk> , and signified to Franz that he was waiting for him to lead the way .
Franz , who had <unk> <unk> the countess , and received from her a gracious smile in <unk> that he would be welcome , sought not to <unk> the <unk> of Albert ’ s eager impatience , but began at once the tour of the house , closely followed by Albert , who <unk> himself of the few minutes required to reach the opposite side of the theatre to settle the height and <unk> of his collar , and to arrange the <unk> of his coat .
This important task was just completed as they arrived at the countess ’ s box .
At the knock , the door was immediately opened , and the young man who was seated beside the countess , in obedience to the Italian custom , instantly rose and <unk> his place to the strangers , who , in turn , would be expected to retire upon the arrival of other visitors .
Franz presented Albert as one of the most distinguished young men of the day , both as regarded his position in society and extraordinary talents ; nor did he say more than the truth , for in Paris and the circle in which the viscount moved , he was looked upon and <unk> as a <unk> of perfection .
Franz added that his companion , deeply grieved at having been prevented the honor of being presented to the countess during her <unk> in Paris , was most anxious to make up for it , and had requested him ( Franz ) to remedy the past misfortune by <unk> him to her box , and concluded by asking pardon for his <unk> in having taken it upon himself to do so .
The countess , in reply , bowed <unk> to Albert , and extended her hand with <unk> kindness to Franz ; then , <unk> Albert to take the <unk> seat beside her , she recommended Franz to take the next best , if he wished to view the <unk> , and pointed to the one behind her own chair .
Albert was soon deeply <unk> in <unk> upon Paris and Parisian matters , speaking to the countess of the various persons they both knew there .
Franz perceived how completely he was in his element ; and , unwilling to interfere with the pleasure he so evidently felt , took up Albert ’ s glass , and began in his turn to <unk> the audience .
<unk> alone , in the front of a box immediately opposite , but situated on the third <unk> , was a woman of exquisite beauty , dressed in a Greek costume , which evidently , from the ease and grace with which she wore it , was her <unk> <unk> .
Behind her , but in deep shadow , was the <unk> of a <unk> figure ; but the features of this latter personage it was not possible to distinguish .
Franz could not <unk> breaking in upon the apparently interesting conversation passing between the countess and Albert , to inquire of the former if she knew who was the fair <unk> opposite , since beauty such as hers was well worthy of being observed by either sex .
“ All I can tell about her , ” replied the countess , “ is , that she has been at Rome since the beginning of the season ; for I saw her where she now <unk> the very first night of the season , and since then she has never missed a <unk> .
Sometimes she is accompanied by the person who is now with her , and at others she is merely attended by a black servant . ” “ And what do you think of her personal appearance ? ” “ Oh , I consider her perfectly lovely — she is just my idea of what <unk> must have been . ” Franz and the countess exchanged a smile , and then the latter resumed her conversation with Albert , while Franz returned to his previous <unk> of the house and company .
The curtain rose on the <unk> , which was one of those excellent <unk> of the Italian school , admirably arranged and put on the stage by <unk> , who has established for himself a great reputation throughout Italy for his taste and skill in the <unk> art — one of those <unk> <unk> of grace , method , and elegance in which the whole _ <unk> de <unk> _ , from the principal <unk> to the <unk> <unk> , are all engaged on the stage at the same time ; and a hundred and fifty persons may be seen <unk> the same attitude , or <unk> the same arm or leg with a <unk> movement , that would lead you to suppose that but one mind , one act of <unk> , <unk> the moving mass .
The <unk> was called _ <unk> _ .
However much the <unk> might have <unk> his attention , Franz was too deeply occupied with the beautiful Greek to take any note of it ; while she seemed to experience an almost <unk> delight in watching it , her eager , animated looks <unk> strongly with the utter indifference of her companion , who , during the whole time the piece lasted , never even moved , not even when the furious , <unk> <unk> produced by the <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> <unk> sounded their <unk> from the <unk> .
Of this he took no heed , but was , as far as appearances might be trusted , <unk> soft repose and bright celestial dreams .
The <unk> at length came to a close , and the curtain fell amid the loud , <unk> <unk> of an enthusiastic and delighted audience .
<unk> to the very <unk> plan of <unk> the two <unk> of the <unk> with a <unk> , the <unk> between the <unk> are very short , the <unk> in the <unk> having time to repose themselves and change their costume , when necessary , while the <unk> are <unk> their <unk> and <unk> their graceful steps .
The <unk> to the second act began ; and , at the first sound of the leader ’ s bow across his <unk> , Franz observed the <unk> slowly arise and approach the Greek girl , who turned around to say a few words to him , and then , leaning forward again on the <unk> of her box , she became as absorbed as before in what was going on .
The countenance of the person who had addressed her remained so completely in the shade , that , though Franz tried his utmost , he could not distinguish a single <unk> .
The curtain rose , and the attention of Franz was attracted by the <unk> ; and his eyes turned from the box containing the Greek girl and her strange companion to watch the business of the stage .
Most of my <unk> are aware that the second act of _ <unk> _ opens with the celebrated and <unk> <unk> in which <unk> , while sleeping , <unk> to <unk> the secret of her love for <unk> .
The injured husband goes through all the emotions of jealousy , until conviction <unk> on his mind , and then , in a <unk> of rage and indignation , he <unk> his guilty wife to tell her that he knows her guilt and to <unk> her with his vengeance .
This <unk> is one of the most beautiful , expressive and terrible <unk> that has ever <unk> from the <unk> pen of <unk> .
Franz now listened to it for the third time ; yet its notes , so tenderly expressive and <unk> grand as the wretched husband and wife give vent to their different <unk> and passions , <unk> through the soul of Franz with an effect equal to his first emotions upon hearing it .
<unk> beyond his usual calm <unk> , Franz rose with the audience , and was about to join the loud , enthusiastic <unk> that followed ; but suddenly his purpose was arrested , his hands fell by his sides , and the <unk> “ <unk> ” <unk> on his lips .
The <unk> of the box in which the Greek girl sat appeared to share the universal admiration that prevailed ; for he left his seat to stand up in front , so that , his countenance being fully revealed , Franz had no difficulty in <unk> him as the mysterious <unk> of Monte Cristo , and the very same person he had encountered the preceding evening in the ruins of the Colosseum , and whose voice and figure had seemed so familiar to him .
All doubt of his identity was now at an end ; his singular host evidently <unk> at Rome .
The surprise and agitation <unk> by this full <unk> of Franz ’ s former suspicion had no doubt <unk> a <unk> expression to his features ; for the countess , after gazing with a <unk> look at his face , burst into a fit of laughter , and begged to know what had happened .
“ <unk> , ” returned Franz , totally <unk> her <unk> , “ I asked you a short time since if you knew any particulars respecting the <unk> lady opposite ; I must now <unk> you to inform me who and what is her husband ? ” “ Nay , ” answered the countess , “ I know no more of him than yourself . ” “ Perhaps you never before noticed him ? ” “ What a question — so truly French !
Do you not know that we <unk> have eyes only for the man we love ? ” “ True , ” replied Franz .
“ All I can say is , ” continued the countess , taking up the _ <unk> _ , and <unk> it toward the box in question , “ that the gentleman , whose history I am unable to furnish , seems to me as though he had just been dug up ; he looks more like a corpse permitted by some friendly grave-digger to quit his tomb for a while , and <unk> this earth of ours , than anything human .
How ghastly pale he is ! ” “ Oh , he is always as <unk> as you now see him , ” said Franz .
“ Then you know him ? ” almost <unk> the countess .
“ Oh , pray do , for heaven ’ s sake , tell us all about — is he a <unk> , or a <unk> corpse , or what ? ” “ I fancy I have seen him before ; and I even think he <unk> me . ” “ And I can well understand , ” said the countess , <unk> up her beautiful shoulders , as though an <unk> shudder passed through her veins , “ that those who have once seen that man will never be likely to forget him . ” The sensation experienced by Franz was evidently not peculiar to himself ; another , and wholly <unk> person , felt the same <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
“ Well . ” inquired Franz , after the countess had a second time directed her _ <unk> _ at the box , “ what do you think of our opposite neighbor ? ” <unk> “ Why , that he is no other than Lord <unk> himself in a living form . ” This fresh allusion to <unk> drew a smile to Franz ’ s countenance ; although he could but allow that if anything was likely to induce belief in the existence of <unk> , it would be the presence of such a man as the mysterious personage before him .
“ I must positively find out who and what he is , ” said Franz , rising from his seat .
“ No , no , ” cried the countess ; “ you must not leave me .
I depend upon you to <unk> me home .
Oh , indeed , I cannot permit you to go . ” “ Is it possible , ” whispered Franz , “ that you entertain any fear ? ” “ I ’ ll tell you , ” answered the countess .
“ <unk> had the most perfect belief in the existence of <unk> , and even assured me that he had seen them .
The description he gave me perfectly <unk> with the features and character of the man before us .
Oh , he is the exact <unk> of what I have been led to expect !
The <unk> hair , large bright , <unk> eyes , in which a wild , <unk> fire seems burning , — the same ghastly <unk> .
Then observe , too , that the woman with him is altogether unlike all others of her sex .
She is a <unk> — a stranger .
Nobody knows who she is , or where she comes from .
No doubt she belongs to the same horrible race he does , and is , like himself , a <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
I entreat of you not to go near him — at least tonight ; and if tomorrow your curiosity still <unk> as great , pursue your <unk> if you will ; but tonight you neither can nor shall .
For that purpose I mean to keep you all to myself . ” Franz <unk> he could not <unk> his pursuit till the following day , for many reasons .
“ Listen to me , ” said the countess , “ and do not be so very <unk> .
I am going home .
I have a party at my house tonight , and therefore cannot possibly remain till the end of the <unk> .
Now , I cannot for one instant believe you so <unk> of gallantry as to refuse a lady your <unk> when she even <unk> to ask you for it . ” There was nothing else left for Franz to do but to take up his hat , open the door of the box , and offer the countess his arm .
It was quite evident , by her manner , that her uneasiness was not <unk> ; and Franz himself could not resist a feeling of <unk> dread — so much the stronger in him , as it arose from a variety of <unk> recollections , while the terror of the countess sprang from an <unk> belief , <unk> created in her mind by the wild <unk> she had listened to till she believed them <unk> .
Franz could even feel her arm tremble as he assisted her into the carriage .
Upon arriving at her hotel , Franz perceived that she had deceived him when she spoke of expecting company ; on the contrary , her own return before the appointed hour seemed greatly to <unk> the servants .
“ Excuse my little <unk> , ” said the countess , in reply to her companion ’ s <unk> observation on the subject ; “ but that horrid man had made me feel quite <unk> , and I longed to be alone , that I might <unk> my startled mind . ” Franz <unk> to smile .
“ Nay , ” said she , “ do not smile ; it ill <unk> with the expression of your countenance , and I am sure it does not spring from your heart .
However , promise me one thing . ” “ What is it ? ” “ <unk> me , I say . ” “ I will do anything you desire , except <unk> my determination of finding out who this man is .
I have more reasons than you can imagine for <unk> to know who he is , from whence he came , and whither he is going . ” “ Where he comes from I am ignorant ; but I can readily tell you where he is going to , and that is down below , without the least doubt . ” “ Let us only speak of the promise you wished me to make , ” said Franz .
“ Well , then , you must give me your word to return immediately to your hotel , and make no attempt to follow this man tonight .
There are certain <unk> between the persons we quit and those we meet afterwards .
For heaven ’ s sake , do not serve as a <unk> between that man and me .
<unk> your <unk> after him tomorrow as eagerly as you please ; but never bring him near me , if you would not see me die of terror .
And now , <unk> ; go to your rooms , and try to sleep away all recollections of this evening .
For my own part , I am quite sure I shall not be able to close my eyes . ” So saying , the countess quitted Franz , leaving him unable to decide whether she were merely amusing herself at his expense , or whether her fears and <unk> were genuine .
Upon his return to the hotel , Franz found Albert in his <unk> and <unk> , <unk> extended on a sofa , smoking a <unk> .
“ My dear fellow ! ” cried he , <unk> up , “ is it really you ?
Why , I did not expect to see you before tomorrow . ” “ My dear Albert , ” replied Franz , “ I am glad of this opportunity to tell you , once and forever , that you entertain a most <unk> <unk> concerning Italian women .
I should have thought the continual <unk> you have met with in all your own love affairs might have taught you better by this time . ” “ Upon my soul , these women would <unk> the very <unk> to read them <unk> .
Why , here — they give you their hand — they press yours in return — they keep up a whispering conversation — permit you to accompany them home .
Why , if a Parisian were to indulge in a quarter of these marks of <unk> attention , her reputation would be gone forever . ” “ And the very reason why the women of this fine country , ‘ where sounds the _ <unk> _ , ’ as <unk> writes , put so little <unk> on their words and actions , is because they live so much in public , and have really nothing to conceal .
Besides , you must have perceived that the countess was really alarmed . ” “ At what ?
At the sight of that respectable gentleman sitting opposite to us in the same box with the lovely Greek girl ?
Now , for my part , I met them in the <unk> after the conclusion of the piece ; and hang me , if I can guess where you took your <unk> of the other world from .
I can assure you that this <unk> of yours is a <unk> <unk> fellow — admirably dressed .
Indeed , I feel quite sure , from the cut of his clothes , they are made by a <unk> Paris <unk> — probably <unk> or <unk> .
He was rather too pale , certainly ; but then , you know , <unk> is always looked upon as a strong proof of <unk> descent and distinguished <unk> . ” Franz smiled ; for he well remembered that Albert particularly <unk> himself on the entire absence of color in his own complexion .
“ Well , that <unk> to <unk> my own ideas , ” said Franz , “ that the countess ’ s suspicions were <unk> <unk> of sense and reason .
Did he speak in your hearing ?
and did you catch any of his words ? ” “ I did ; but they were uttered in the <unk> <unk> .
I knew that from the mixture of Greek words .
I don ’ t know whether I ever told you that when I was at <unk> I was rather — rather strong in Greek . ” “ He spoke the <unk> language , did he ? ” “ I think so . ” “ That <unk> it , ” murmured Franz .
“ ’ Tis he , past all doubt . ” “ What do you say ? ” “ Nothing , nothing .
But tell me , what were you thinking about when I came in ? ” “ Oh , I was arranging a little surprise for you . ” “ Indeed .
Of what nature ? ” “ Why , you know it is quite impossible to procure a carriage . ” “ Certainly ; and I also know that we have done all that human means afforded to endeavor to get one . ” “ Now , then , in this difficulty a bright idea has <unk> across my brain . ” Franz looked at Albert as though he had not much confidence in the <unk> of his imagination .
“ I tell you what , M. Franz , ” cried Albert , “ you deserve to be called out for such a <unk> and <unk> glance as that you were pleased to bestow on me just now . ” “ And I promise to give you the satisfaction of a gentleman if your scheme turns out as ingenious as you <unk> . ” “ Well , then , <unk> to me . ” “ I listen . ” “ You agree , do you not , that obtaining a carriage is out of the question ? ” “ I do . ” “ Neither can we procure horses ? ” “ True ; we have offered any sum , but have failed . ” “ Well , now , what do you say to a cart ?
I dare say such a thing might be had . ” “ Very possibly . ” “ And a pair of <unk> ? ” “ As easily found as the cart . ” “ Then you see , my good fellow , with a cart and a couple of <unk> our business can be managed .
The cart must be <unk> ornamented ; and if you and I dress ourselves as <unk> <unk> , we may get up a striking <unk> , after the manner of that splendid picture by <unk> Robert .
It would add greatly to the effect if the countess would join us in the costume of a peasant from <unk> or <unk> .
Our group would then be quite complete , more especially as the countess is quite beautiful enough to <unk> a <unk> . ” “ Well , ” said Franz , “ this time , M. Albert , I am bound to give you credit for having <unk> upon a most capital idea . ” “ And quite a <unk> one , too , ” replied Albert with gratified pride .
“ A mere <unk> <unk> from our own <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> , ye <unk> !
you thought to make us , unhappy strangers , <unk> at the heels of your <unk> , like so many <unk> , because no carriages or horses are to be had in your <unk> city .
But you don ’ t know us ; when we can ’ t have one thing we <unk> another . ” “ And have you communicated your triumphant idea to anybody ? ” “ Only to our host .
Upon my return home I sent for him , and I then explained to him what I wished to procure .
He assured me that nothing would be <unk> than to furnish all I desired .
One thing I was sorry for ; when I bade him have the <unk> of the <unk> gilded , he told me there would not be time , as it would require three days to do that ; so you see we must do without this little <unk> . ” “ And where is he now ? ” “ Who ? ” “ Our host . ” “ <unk> out in search of our <unk> , by tomorrow it might be too late . ” “ Then he will be able to give us an answer tonight . ” “ Oh , I expect him every minute . ” At this instant the door opened , and the head of Signor Pastrini appeared .
“ _ <unk> _ ? ” inquired he .
“ Certainly — certainly , ” cried Franz .
“ Come in , my host . ” “ Now , then , ” asked Albert eagerly , “ have you found the desired cart and <unk> ? ” “ <unk> than that ! ” replied Signor Pastrini , with the air of a man perfectly well satisfied with himself .
“ Take care , my worthy host , ” said Albert , “ _ better _ is a sure enemy to _ well _ . ” “ Let your <unk> only leave the matter to me , ” returned Signor Pastrini in a tone <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
“ But what _ have _ you done ? ” asked Franz .
“ Speak out , there ’ s a worthy fellow . ” “ Your <unk> are aware , ” responded the landlord , <unk> with importance , “ that the Count of Monte Cristo is living on the same floor with yourselves ! ” “ I should think we did know it , ” exclaimed Albert , “ since it is owing to that circumstance that we are <unk> into these small rooms , like two poor <unk> in the back streets of Paris . ” “ When , then , the Count of Monte Cristo , hearing of the <unk> in which you are placed , has sent to offer you <unk> in his carriage and two places at his windows in the <unk> <unk> . ” The friends looked at each other with <unk> surprise .
“ But do you think , ” asked Albert , “ that we ought to accept such offers from a perfect stranger ? ” “ What sort of person is this Count of Monte Cristo ? ” asked Franz of his host .
“ A very great <unk> , but whether <unk> or <unk> I cannot exactly say ; but this I know , that he is noble as a <unk> and rich as a gold mine . ” “ It seems to me , ” said Franz , speaking in an <unk> to Albert , “ that if this person <unk> the high <unk> of our landlord , he would have conveyed his invitation through another <unk> , and not permitted it to be brought to us in this <unk> way .
He would have written — or — — ” At this instant someone knocked at the door .
“ Come in , ” said Franz .
A servant , wearing a <unk> of considerable style and <unk> , appeared at the threshold , and , placing two cards in the landlord ’ s hands , who <unk> presented them to the two young men , he said : “ <unk> to deliver these , from the Count of Monte Cristo to <unk> Albert de Morcerf and M. Franz d ’ Épinay .
The Count of Monte Cristo , ” continued the servant , “ <unk> these gentlemen ’ s permission to wait upon them as their neighbor , and he will be <unk> by an <unk> of what time they will please to receive him . ” “ <unk> , Franz , ” whispered Albert , “ there is not much to find fault with here . ” “ Tell the count , ” replied Franz , “ that we will do ourselves the pleasure of calling on him . ” The servant bowed and retired .
“ That is what I call an elegant mode of attack , ” said Albert , “ You were quite correct in what you said , Signor Pastrini .
The Count of Monte Cristo is <unk> a man of <unk> <unk> and knowledge of the world . ” “ Then you accept his offer ? ” said the host .
“ Of course we do , ” replied Albert .
“ Still , I must own I am sorry to be obliged to give up the cart and the group of <unk> — it would have produced such an effect !
And were it not for the windows at the <unk> <unk> , by way of recompense for the loss of our beautiful scheme , I don ’ t know but what I should have held on by my original plan .
What say you , Franz ? ” “ Oh , I agree with you ; the windows in the <unk> <unk> alone decided me . ” The truth was , that the mention of two places in the <unk> <unk> had recalled to Franz the conversation he had <unk> the preceding evening in the ruins of the Colosseum between the mysterious unknown and the <unk> , in which the stranger in the cloak had <unk> to obtain the freedom of a condemned criminal ; and if this <unk> individual proved ( as Franz felt sure he would ) the same as the person he had just seen in the <unk> <unk> , then he should be able to <unk> his identity , and also to <unk> his <unk> respecting him with perfect <unk> and freedom .
Franz passed the night in confused dreams respecting the two <unk> he had already had with his mysterious <unk> , and in waking <unk> as to what the morrow would produce .
The next day must clear up every doubt ; and unless his near neighbor and <unk> friend , the Count of Monte Cristo , possessed the ring of <unk> , and by its power was able to render himself invisible , it was very certain he could not escape this time .
<unk> o ’ clock found Franz up and dressed , while Albert , who had not the same motives for early rising , was still <unk> asleep .
The first act of Franz was to summon his landlord , who presented himself with his accustomed <unk> .
“ Pray , Signor Pastrini , ” asked Franz , “ is not some execution appointed to take place today ? ” “ Yes , your excellency ; but if your reason for inquiry is that you may procure a window to view it from , you are much too late . ” “ Oh , no , ” answered Franz , “ I had no such intention ; and even if I had felt a wish to witness the spectacle , I might have done so from Monte <unk> ; could I not ? ” “ Ah ! ” exclaimed mine host , “ I did not think it likely your excellency would have chosen to <unk> with such a <unk> as are always collected on that hill , which , indeed , they consider as <unk> belonging to themselves . ” “ Very possibly I may not go , ” answered Franz ; “ but in case I feel disposed , give me some particulars of today ’ s <unk> . ” “ What particulars would your excellency like to hear ? ” “ Why , the number of persons condemned to suffer , their names , and description of the death they are to die . ” “ That happens just lucky , your excellency !
Only a few minutes ago they brought me the _ <unk> _ . ” “ What are they ? ” “ <unk> of wooden <unk> hung up at the corners of streets the evening before an execution , on which is <unk> up a paper containing the names of the condemned persons , their crimes , and mode of punishment .
The reason for so <unk> <unk> all this is , that all good and faithful <unk> may offer up their prayers for the unfortunate <unk> , and , above all , <unk> of Heaven to grant them a sincere <unk> . ” “ And these <unk> are brought to you that you may add your prayers to those of the faithful , are they ? ” asked Franz somewhat <unk> .
“ Oh , dear , no , your excellency !
I have not time for anybody ’ s affairs but my own and those of my honorable guests ; but I make an agreement with the man who <unk> up the papers , and he brings them to me as he would the <unk> , that in case any person staying at my hotel should like to witness an execution , he may obtain every requisite information concerning the time and place etc . ” “ Upon my word , that is a most delicate attention on your part , Signor Pastrini , ” cried Franz .
“ Why , your excellency , ” returned the landlord , <unk> and <unk> his hands with infinite <unk> , “ I think I may take upon myself to say I neglect nothing to deserve the support and <unk> of the noble visitors to this poor hotel . ” “ I see that plainly enough , my most excellent host , and you may rely upon me to <unk> so striking a proof of your attention to your guests wherever I go .
Meanwhile , oblige me by a sight of one of these _ <unk> _ . ” “ Nothing can be <unk> than to comply with your excellency ’ s wish , ” said the landlord , opening the door of the chamber ; “ I have caused one to be placed on the landing , close by your apartment . ” Then , taking the <unk> from the wall , he handed it to Franz , who read as follows : “ ‘ The public is informed that on <unk> , February <unk> , being the first day of the Carnival , <unk> will take place in the Piazza del <unk> , by order of the <unk> of the <unk> , of two persons , named Andrea <unk> , and Peppino , otherwise called <unk> <unk> ; the former found guilty of the murder of a venerable and <unk> priest , named Don <unk> <unk> , <unk> of the church of St. John <unk> ; and the latter <unk> of being an <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> bandit , Luigi Vampa , and his band .
The <unk> <unk> will be _ <unk> _ , the second <unk> _ <unk> _ .
“ ‘ The prayers of all good <unk> are <unk> for these unfortunate men , that it may please God to <unk> them to a sense of their guilt , and to grant them a <unk> and sincere <unk> for their crimes . ’ ” This was precisely what Franz had heard the evening before in the ruins of the Colosseum .
No part of the <unk> <unk> , — the names of the condemned persons , their crimes , and mode of punishment , all agreed with his previous information .
In all probability , therefore , the <unk> was no other than the bandit Luigi Vampa himself , and the man <unk> in the mantle the same he had known as “ Sinbad the <unk> , ” but who , no doubt , was still pursuing his <unk> <unk> in Rome , as he had already done at <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> was getting on , however , and Franz <unk> it <unk> to <unk> Albert ; but at the moment he prepared to proceed to his chamber , his friend entered the room in perfect costume for the day .
The anticipated <unk> of the Carnival had so run in his head as to make him leave his pillow long before his usual hour .
“ Now , my excellent Signor Pastrini , ” said Franz , addressing his landlord , “ since we are both ready , do you think we may proceed at once to visit the Count of Monte Cristo ? ” “ Most assuredly , ” replied he .
“ The Count of Monte Cristo is always an early <unk> ; and I can answer for his having been up these two hours . ” “ Then you really consider we shall not be <unk> if we pay our respects to him directly ? ” <unk> “ Oh , I am quite sure .
I will take all the blame on myself if you find I have led you into an error . ” “ Well , then , if it be so , are you ready , Albert ? ” “ <unk> . ” “ Let us go and return our best thanks for his <unk> . ” “ Yes , let us do so . ” The landlord preceded the friends across the landing , which was all that separated them from the apartments of the count , rang at the bell , and , upon the door being opened by a servant , said : “ _ I <unk> <unk> _ . ” The domestic bowed <unk> , and invited them to enter .
They passed through two rooms , furnished in a <unk> manner they had not expected to see under the roof of Signor Pastrini , and were shown into an <unk> <unk> drawing-room .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> covered the floor , and the <unk> and most <unk> <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , offered their <unk> and <unk> <unk> to such as desired repose or <unk> .
<unk> <unk> by the first masters were <unk> against the walls , <unk> with magnificent <unk> of war , while heavy curtains of <unk> <unk> were suspended before the different doors of the room .
“ If your <unk> will please to be seated , ” said the man , “ I will let the count know that you are here . ” And with these words he disappeared behind one of the <unk> _ <unk> _ .
As the door opened , the sound of a _ <unk> _ reached the ears of the young men , but was almost immediately lost , for the rapid closing of the door merely allowed one rich <unk> of <unk> to enter .
Franz and Albert looked <unk> at each other , then at the <unk> <unk> of the apartment .
Everything seemed more magnificent at a second view than it had done at their first rapid <unk> .
“ Well , ” said Franz to his friend , “ what think you of all this ? ” “ Why , upon my soul , my dear fellow , it strikes me that our elegant and attentive neighbor must either be some successful <unk> who has <unk> in the fall of the Spanish <unk> , or some prince travelling _ <unk> _ . ” “ Hush , <unk> ! ” replied Franz ; “ we shall ascertain who and what he is — he comes ! ” As Franz spoke , he heard the sound of a door turning on its hinges , and almost immediately afterwards the <unk> was drawn aside , and the owner of all these riches stood before the two young men .
Albert instantly rose to meet him , but Franz remained , in a manner , <unk> on his chair ; for in the person of him who had just entered he recognized not only the mysterious <unk> to the Colosseum , and the <unk> of the box at the <unk> <unk> , but also his extraordinary host of Monte Cristo .
<unk> Chapter <unk> .
La <unk> Gentlemen , ” said the Count of Monte Cristo as he entered , “ I pray you excuse me for suffering my visit to be anticipated ; but I feared to disturb you by presenting myself earlier at your apartments ; besides , you sent me word that you would come to me , and I have held myself at your disposal . ” “ Franz and I have to thank you a thousand times , count , ” returned Albert ; “ you <unk> us from a great <unk> , and we were on the point of <unk> a very fantastic vehicle when your friendly invitation reached us . ” “ Indeed , ” returned the count , <unk> the two young men to sit down .
“ It was the fault of that <unk> Pastrini , that I did not sooner assist you in your distress .
He did not mention a syllable of your embarrassment to me , when he knows that , alone and isolated as I am , I seek every opportunity of making the acquaintance of my neighbors .
As soon as I learned I could in any way assist you , I most eagerly seized the opportunity of offering my services . ” The two young men bowed .
Franz had , as yet , found nothing to say ; he had come to no determination , and as nothing in the count ’ s manner manifested the wish that he should recognize him , he did not know whether to make any allusion to the past , or wait until he had more proof ; besides , although sure it was he who had been in the box the previous evening , he could not be equally <unk> that this was the man he had seen at the Colosseum .
He resolved , therefore , to let things take their course without making any direct <unk> to the count .
Moreover , he had this advantage , he was master of the count ’ s secret , while the count had no hold on Franz , who had nothing to conceal .
However , he resolved to lead the conversation to a subject which might possibly clear up his doubts .
“ Count , ” said he , “ you have offered us places in your carriage , and at your windows in the <unk> <unk> .
Can you tell us where we can obtain a sight of the Piazza del <unk> ? ” “ Ah , ” said the count <unk> , looking attentively at Morcerf , “ is there not something like an execution upon the Piazza del <unk> ? ” “ Yes , ” returned Franz , finding that the count was coming to the point he wished .
“ Stay , I think I told my steward yesterday to attend to this ; perhaps I can render you this slight service also . ” He extended his hand , and rang the bell <unk> .
“ Did you ever occupy yourself , ” said he to Franz , “ with the employment of time and the means of <unk> the <unk> your servants ?
I have .
When I ring once , it is for my valet ; twice , for my <unk> ; <unk> , for my steward , — thus I do not waste a minute or a word .
Here he is . ” A man of about <unk> or fifty entered , exactly resembling the <unk> who had introduced Franz into the cavern ; but he did not appear to recognize him .
It was evident he had his orders .
“ Monsieur Bertuccio , ” said the count , “ you have procured me windows looking on the Piazza del <unk> , as I ordered you yesterday . ” “ Yes , excellency , ” returned the steward ; “ but it was very late . ” “ Did I not tell you I wished for one ? ” replied the count , <unk> .
“ And your excellency has one , which was let to Prince <unk> ; but I was obliged to pay a hundred — — ” “ That will do — that will do , Monsieur Bertuccio ; spare these gentlemen all such domestic arrangements .
You have the window , that is sufficient .
Give orders to the coachman ; and be in readiness on the stairs to conduct us to it . ” The steward bowed , and was about to quit the room .
“ Ah ! ” continued the count , “ be good enough to ask Pastrini if he has received the _ <unk> _ , and if he can send us an account of the execution . ” “ There is no need to do that , ” said Franz , taking out his <unk> ; “ for I saw the account , and copied it down . ” “ Very well , you can retire , M. Bertuccio ; I need you no longer .
Let us know when breakfast is ready .
These gentlemen , ” added he , turning to the two friends , “ will , I trust , do me the honor to breakfast with me ? ” “ But , my dear count , ” said Albert , “ we shall <unk> your kindness . ” “ Not at all ; on the contrary , you will give me great pleasure .
You will , one or other of you , perhaps both , return it to me at Paris .
M. Bertuccio , lay <unk> for three . ” He then took Franz ’ s <unk> out of his hand .
“ ‘ We announce , ’ he read , in the same tone with which he would have read a <unk> , ‘ that today , the <unk> of February , will be executed Andrea <unk> , guilty of murder on the person of the respected and <unk> Don <unk> <unk> , <unk> of the church of St. John <unk> , and Peppino , called <unk> <unk> , <unk> of <unk> with the <unk> bandit Luigi Vampa , and the men of his band . ’ “ <unk> !
‘ The first will be _ <unk> _ , the second _ <unk> _ . ’ Yes , ” continued the count , “ it was at first arranged in this way ; but I think since yesterday some change has taken place in the order of the ceremony . ” “ Really ? ” said Franz .
“ Yes , I passed the evening at the Cardinal <unk> ’ s , and there mention was made of something like a pardon for one of the two men . ” “ For Andrea <unk> ? ” asked Franz .
“ No , ” replied the count , <unk> ; “ for the other ( he glanced at the <unk> as if to recall the name ) , for Peppino , called <unk> <unk> .
You are thus deprived of seeing a man <unk> ; but the _ <unk> _ still remains , which is a very curious punishment when seen for the first time , and even the second , while the other , as you must know , is very simple .
The _ <unk> _ 6 never <unk> , never <unk> , never strikes thirty times <unk> , like the soldier who <unk> the Count of <unk> , and to whose tender mercy <unk> had doubtless recommended the <unk> .
Ah , ” added the count , in a <unk> tone , “ do not tell me of <unk> <unk> , they are in the <unk> , or rather the old age , of <unk> . ” “ Really , count , ” replied Franz , “ one would think that you had studied the different <unk> of all the nations of the world . ” “ There are , at least , few that I have not seen , ” said the count coldly .
“ And you took pleasure in <unk> these dreadful spectacles ? ” “ My first sentiment was horror , the second indifference , the third curiosity . ” “ <unk> — that is a terrible word . ” “ Why so ?
In life , our greatest <unk> is death ; is it not then , curious to study the different ways by which the soul and body can part ; and how , according to their different characters , <unk> , and even the different customs of their countries , different persons bear the <unk> from life to death , from existence to <unk> ?
As for myself , I can assure you of one thing , — the more men you see die , the <unk> it becomes to die yourself ; and in my opinion , death may be a torture , but it is not an <unk> . ” “ I do not quite understand you , ” replied Franz ; “ pray explain your meaning , for you excite my curiosity to the highest <unk> . ” “ Listen , ” said the count , and deep hatred mounted to his face , as the blood would to the face of any other .
“ If a man had by <unk> and <unk> <unk> destroyed your father , your mother , your betrothed , — a being who , when torn from you , left a <unk> , a wound that never <unk> , in your breast , — do you think the <unk> that society gives you is sufficient when it <unk> the knife of the <unk> between the base of the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> of the murderer , and <unk> him who has caused us years of moral sufferings to escape with a few moments of physical pain ? ” “ Yes , I know , ” said Franz , “ that human justice is <unk> to console us ; she can give blood in return for blood , that is all ; but you must demand from her only what it is in her power to grant . ” “ I will put another case to you , ” continued the count ; “ that where society , attacked by the death of a person , <unk> death by death .
But are there not a thousand <unk> by which a man may be made to suffer without society taking the least <unk> of them , or offering him even the <unk> means of vengeance , of which we have just spoken ?
Are there not crimes for which the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , the stake and the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , are <unk> <unk> , and which are <unk> by society ?
<unk> me , do not these crimes exist ? ” “ Yes , ” answered Franz ; “ and it is to <unk> them that <unk> is <unk> . ” “ Ah , <unk> , ” cried the count ; “ a pleasant manner , upon my soul , of arriving at your end when that end is vengeance !
A man has carried off your mistress , a man has <unk> your wife , a man has <unk> your daughter ; he has rendered the whole life of one who had the right to expect from Heaven that portion of happiness God has promised to everyone of his creatures , an existence of misery and <unk> ; and you think you are <unk> because you send a ball through the head , or pass a sword through the breast , of that man who has planted madness in your brain , and despair in your heart .
And remember , moreover , that it is often he who comes off <unk> from the <unk> , <unk> of all crime in the eyes of the world .
No , no , ” continued the count , “ had I to <unk> myself , it is not thus I would take revenge . ” “ Then you <unk> of <unk> ?
You would not fight a duel ? ” asked Albert in his turn , astonished at this strange theory .
“ Oh , yes , ” replied the count ; “ understand me , I would fight a duel for a trifle , for an insult , for a blow ; and the more so that , thanks to my skill in all <unk> <unk> , and the indifference to danger I have gradually acquired , I should be almost certain to kill my man .
Oh , I would fight for such a cause ; but in return for a slow , profound , eternal torture , I would give back the same , were it possible ; an eye for an eye , a <unk> for a <unk> , as the <unk> say , — our masters in everything , — those <unk> creatures who have formed for themselves a life of dreams and a paradise of realities . ” “ But , ” said Franz to the count , “ with this theory , which renders you at once judge and executioner of your own cause , it would be difficult to <unk> a course that would forever prevent your falling under the power of the law .
<unk> is blind , rage <unk> you away ; and he who <unk> out vengeance runs the risk of <unk> a bitter draught . ” “ Yes , if he be poor and <unk> , not if he be rich and skilful ; besides , the worst that could happen to him would be the punishment of which we have already spoken , and which the <unk> French Revolution has <unk> for being torn to pieces by horses or broken on the wheel .
What matters this punishment , as long as he is <unk> ?
On my word , I almost regret that in all probability this miserable Peppino will not be <unk> , as you might have had an opportunity then of seeing how short a time the punishment <unk> , and whether it is worth even <unk> ; but , really this is a most singular conversation for the Carnival , gentlemen ; how did it arise ?
Ah , I recollect , you asked for a place at my window ; you shall have it ; but let us first sit down to table , for here comes the servant to inform us that breakfast is ready . ” As he spoke , a servant opened one of the four doors of the apartment , saying : “ _ <unk> <unk> <unk> ! _ ” The two young men arose and entered the <unk> .
During the <unk> , which was excellent , and admirably served , Franz looked <unk> at Albert , in order to observe the <unk> which he doubted not had been made on him by the words of their <unk> ; but whether with his usual <unk> he had paid but little attention to him , whether the explanation of the Count of Monte Cristo with regard to <unk> had satisfied him , or whether the events which Franz knew of had had their effect on him alone , he remarked that his companion did not pay the least regard to them , but on the contrary ate like a man who for the last four or five months had been condemned to <unk> of Italian <unk> — that is , the worst in the world .
As for the count , he just touched the <unk> ; he seemed to fulfil the duties of a host by sitting down with his guests , and awaited their departure to be served with some strange or more delicate food .
This brought back to Franz , in spite of himself , the recollection of the terror with which the count had inspired the <unk> G — — , and her firm conviction that the man in the opposite box was a <unk> .
At the end of the breakfast Franz took out his watch .
“ Well , ” said the count , “ what are you doing ? ” “ You must excuse us , count , ” returned Franz , “ but we have still much to do . ” “ What may that be ? ” “ We have no <unk> , and it is absolutely necessary to procure them . ” “ Do not concern yourself about that ; we have , I think , a private room in the Piazza del <unk> ; I will have whatever <unk> you choose brought to us , and you can dress there . ” “ After the execution ? ” cried Franz .
“ Before or after , <unk> you please . ” “ <unk> the scaffold ? ” “ The scaffold forms part of the _ <unk> _ . ” “ Count , I have reflected on the matter , ” said Franz , “ I thank you for your <unk> , but I shall content myself with accepting a place in your carriage and at your window at the <unk> <unk> , and I leave you at liberty to <unk> of my place at the Piazza del <unk> . ” “ But I warn you , you will lose a very curious sight , ” returned the count .
“ You will describe it to me , ” replied Franz , “ and the <unk> from your lips will make as great an impression on me as if I had witnessed it .
I have more than once intended <unk> an execution , but I have never been able to make up my mind ; and you , Albert ? ” “ I , ” replied the viscount , — “ I saw <unk> executed , but I think I was rather intoxicated that day , for I had quitted <unk> the same morning , and we had passed the previous night at a tavern . ” “ Besides , it is no reason because you have not seen an execution at Paris , that you should not see one anywhere else ; when you travel , it is to see everything .
Think what a figure you will make when you are asked , ‘ How do they <unk> at Rome ? ’ and you reply , ‘ I do not know ! ’ And , besides , they say that the <unk> is an infamous <unk> , who killed with a <unk> of wood a worthy <unk> who had brought him up like his own son .
_ <unk> ! _ when a <unk> is killed , it should be with a different weapon than a <unk> , especially when he has behaved like a father .
If you went to Spain , would you not see the <unk> ?
Well , suppose it is a <unk> you are going to see ?
<unk> the ancient <unk> of the <unk> , and the <unk> where they killed three hundred <unk> and a hundred men .
Think of the eighty thousand <unk> spectators , the <unk> <unk> who took their daughters , and the charming <unk> who made with the <unk> of their white hands the fatal sign that said , ‘ Come , <unk> the dying . ’ ” “ Shall you go , then , Albert ? ” asked Franz .
“ _ Ma foi _ , yes ; like you , I hesitated , but the count ’ s <unk> <unk> me . ” “ Let us go , then , ” said Franz , “ since you wish it ; but on our way to the Piazza del <unk> , I wish to pass through the <unk> .
Is this possible , count ? ” “ On foot , yes , in a carriage , no . ” “ I will go on foot , then . ” “ Is it important that you should go that way ? ” “ Yes , there is something I wish to see . ” “ Well , we will go by the <unk> .
We will send the carriage to wait for us on the Piazza del <unk> , by the <unk> del <unk> , for I shall be glad to pass , myself , through the <unk> , to see if some orders I have given have been executed . ” “ <unk> , ” said a servant , opening the door , “ a man in the dress of a <unk> wishes to speak to you . ” “ Ah !
yes , ” returned the count , “ I know who he is , gentlemen ; will you return to the salon ?
you will find good <unk> on the centre table .
I will be with you directly . ” The young men rose and returned into the salon , while the count , again <unk> , left by another door .
Albert , who was a great <unk> , and who had considered it no small sacrifice to be deprived of the <unk> of the Café de Paris , approached the table , and uttered a cry of joy at perceiving some <unk> _ <unk> _ .
“ Well , ” asked Franz , “ what think you of the Count of Monte Cristo ? ” “ What do I think ? ” said Albert , evidently surprised at such a question from his companion ; “ I think he is a delightful fellow , who does the <unk> of his table admirably ; who has travelled much , read much , is , like <unk> , of the <unk> school , and moreover , ” added he , sending a volume of smoke up towards the ceiling , “ that he has excellent <unk> . ” Such was Albert ’ s opinion of the count , and as Franz well knew that Albert <unk> never to form an opinion except upon long reflection , he made no attempt to change it .
“ But , ” said he , “ did you observe one very singular thing ? ” “ What ? ” “ How attentively he looked at you . ” “ At me ? ” “ Yes . ” Albert reflected .
“ Ah , ” replied he , <unk> , “ that is not very surprising ; I have been more than a year absent from Paris , and my clothes are of a most <unk> cut ; the count takes me for a <unk> .
The first opportunity you have , <unk> him , I beg , and tell him I am nothing of the kind . ” Franz smiled ; an instant after the count entered .
“ I am now quite at your service , gentlemen , ” said he .
“ The carriage is going one way to the Piazza del <unk> , and we will go another ; and , if you please , by the <unk> .
Take some more of these <unk> , M. de Morcerf . ” “ With all my heart , ” returned Albert ; “ Italian <unk> are horrible .
When you come to Paris , I will return all this . ” “ I will not refuse ; I intend going there soon , and since you allow me , I will pay you a visit .
Come , we have not any time to lose , it is half-past twelve — let us set off . ” All three descended ; the coachman received his master ’ s orders , and drove down the <unk> del <unk> .
While the three gentlemen walked along the Piazza <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> , which led directly between the <unk> and <unk> <unk> , Franz ’ s attention was directed towards the windows of that last palace , for he had not forgotten the signal agreed upon between the man in the mantle and the <unk> peasant .
“ Which are your windows ? ” asked he of the count , with as much indifference as he could assume .
“ The three last , ” returned he , with a <unk> evidently <unk> , for he could not imagine with what intention the question was put .
Franz glanced rapidly towards the three windows .
The side windows were hung with yellow damask , and the centre one with white damask and a red cross .
The man in the mantle had kept his promise to the <unk> , and there could now be no doubt that he was the count .
The three windows were still <unk> .
<unk> were making on every side ; chairs were placed , <unk> were raised , and windows were hung with <unk> .
The <unk> could not appear ; the carriages could not move about ; but the <unk> were visible behind the windows , the carriages , and the doors .
Franz , Albert , and the count continued to descend the <unk> .
As they approached the Piazza del <unk> , the crowd became more <unk> , and above the heads of the multitude two objects were visible : the <unk> , surmounted by a cross , which marks the centre of the square , and in front of the <unk> , at the point where the three streets , del <unk> , del <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , meet , the two <unk> of the scaffold , between which <unk> the <unk> knife of the _ <unk> _ .
At the corner of the street they met the count ’ s steward , who was awaiting his master .
The window , let at an <unk> price , which the count had doubtless wished to conceal from his guests , was on the second floor of the great palace , situated between the <unk> del <unk> and the Monte <unk> .
It consisted , as we have said , of a small dressing-room , opening into a bedroom , and , when the door of communication was shut , the <unk> were quite alone .
On chairs were laid elegant <unk> <unk> of blue and white satin .
<unk> “ As you left the choice of your <unk> to me , ” said the count to the two friends , “ I have had these brought , as they will be the most worn this year ; and they are most suitable , on account of the _ <unk> _ ( <unk> ) , as they do not show the <unk> . ” Franz heard the words of the count but <unk> , and he perhaps did not fully <unk> this new attention to their wishes ; for he was wholly absorbed by the spectacle that the Piazza del <unk> presented , and by the terrible instrument that was in the centre .
It was the first time Franz had ever seen a <unk> , — we say <unk> , because the Roman _ <unk> _ is formed on almost the same <unk> as the French <unk> The knife , which is <unk> like a <unk> , that <unk> with the <unk> side , falls from a less height , and that is all the difference .
Two men , seated on the <unk> <unk> on which the victim is laid , were eating their <unk> , while waiting for the criminal .
Their <unk> consisted apparently of bread and <unk> .
One of them lifted the <unk> , took out a <unk> of wine , drank some , and then passed it to his companion .
These two men were the executioner ’ s <unk> .
At this sight Franz felt the perspiration start forth upon his brow .
The prisoners , <unk> the previous evening from the <unk> <unk> to the little church of <unk> Maria del <unk> , had passed the night , each accompanied by two priests , in a chapel closed by a grating , before which were two <unk> , who were relieved at intervals .
A double line of <unk> , placed on each side of the door of the church , reached to the scaffold , and formed a circle around it , leaving a path about ten feet wide , and around the <unk> a space of nearly a hundred feet .
All the rest of the square was <unk> with heads .
Many women held their <unk> on their shoulders , and thus the children had the best view .
The Monte <unk> seemed a vast <unk> filled with spectators ; the <unk> of the two <unk> at the corner of the <unk> del <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> were <unk> ; the steps even seemed a <unk> sea , that was <unk> towards the <unk> ; every <unk> in the wall held its living statue .
What the count said was true — the most curious spectacle in life is that of death .
And yet , instead of the silence and the solemnity demanded by the occasion , laughter and <unk> arose from the crowd .
It was evident that the execution was , in the eyes of the people , only the <unk> of the Carnival .
Suddenly the tumult ceased , as if by <unk> , and the doors of the church opened .
A <unk> of <unk> , clothed from head to foot in <unk> of gray <unk> , with holes for the eyes , and holding in their hands lighted <unk> , appeared first ; the chief <unk> at the head .
<unk> Behind the <unk> came a man of vast stature and <unk> .
He was naked , with the exception of cloth <unk> at the left side of which hung a large knife in a <unk> , and he bore on his right shoulder a heavy iron <unk> .
This man was the executioner .
He had , moreover , <unk> bound on his feet by <unk> .
Behind the executioner came , in the order in which they were to die , first Peppino and then Andrea .
Each was accompanied by two priests .
Neither had his eyes <unk> .
Peppino walked with a firm step , doubtless aware of what awaited him .
Andrea was supported by two priests .
Each of them , from time to time , kissed the crucifix a <unk> held out to them .
At this sight alone Franz felt his legs tremble under him .
He looked at Albert — he was as white as his shirt , and mechanically cast away his <unk> , although he had not half <unk> it .
The count alone seemed <unk> — nay , more , a slight color seemed <unk> to rise in his pale cheeks .
His <unk> <unk> like those of a wild beast that <unk> its prey , and his lips , half opened , <unk> his white teeth , small and sharp like those of a <unk> .
And yet his features wore an expression of smiling tenderness , such as Franz had never before witnessed in them ; his black eyes especially were full of kindness and pity .
However , the two <unk> advanced , and as they approached their faces became visible .
Peppino was a handsome young man of four or <unk> , <unk> by the sun ; he carried his head erect , and seemed on the watch to see on which side his <unk> would appear .
Andrea was short and fat ; his visage , marked with brutal <unk> , did not indicate age ; he might be thirty .
In prison he had suffered his beard to grow ; his head fell on his shoulder , his legs bent beneath him , and his movements were apparently <unk> and unconscious .
“ I thought , ” said Franz to the count , “ that you told me there would be but one execution . ” “ I told you true , ” replied he coldly .
“ And yet here are two <unk> . ” “ Yes ; but only one of these two is about to die ; the other has many years to live . ” “ If the pardon is to come , there is no time to lose . ” “ And see , here it is , ” said the count .
At the moment when Peppino reached the foot of the _ <unk> _ , a priest arrived in some haste , forced his way through the soldiers , and , advancing to the chief of the <unk> , gave him a folded paper .
The piercing eye of Peppino had noticed all .
The chief took the paper , unfolded it , and , raising his hand , “ Heaven be <unk> , and his <unk> also , ” said he in a loud voice ; “ here is a pardon for one of the prisoners ! ” “ A pardon ! ” cried the people with one voice ; “ a pardon ! ” At this cry Andrea raised his head .
“ Pardon for whom ? ” cried he .
Peppino remained breathless .
“ A pardon for Peppino , called <unk> <unk> , ” said the principal <unk> .
And he passed the paper to the officer <unk> the <unk> , who read and returned it to him .
“ For Peppino ! ” cried Andrea , who seemed roused from the <unk> in which he had been plunged .
“ Why for him and not for me ?
We ought to die together .
I was promised he should die with me .
You have no right to put me to death alone .
I will not die alone — I will not ! ” And he broke from the priests <unk> and <unk> like a wild beast , and <unk> <unk> to break the <unk> that bound his hands .
The executioner made a sign , and his two <unk> leaped from the scaffold and seized him .
“ What is going on ? ” asked Franz of the count ; for , as all the talk was in the Roman <unk> , he had not perfectly understood it .
“ Do you not see ? ” returned the count , “ that this human creature who is about to die is furious that his <unk> does not <unk> with him ?
and , were he able , he would rather tear him to pieces with his teeth and nails than let him enjoy the life he himself is about to be deprived of .
Oh , man , man — race of <unk> , ” cried the count , extending his clenched hands towards the crowd , “ how well do I recognize you there , and that at all times you are worthy of yourselves ! ” Meanwhile Andrea and the two <unk> were <unk> on the ground , and he kept <unk> , “ He ought to die ! — he shall die ! — I will not die alone ! ” “ Look , look , ” cried the count , seizing the young men ’ s hands ; “ look , for on my soul it is curious .
Here is a man who had resigned himself to his fate , who was going to the scaffold to die — like a coward , it is true , but he was about to die without resistance .
Do you know what gave him strength ?
do you know what <unk> him ?
It was , that another <unk> of his punishment — that another <unk> of his anguish — that another was to die before him !
<unk> two <unk> to the <unk> ’ s , two <unk> to the <unk> , and make one of them understand that his companion will not die ; the <unk> will <unk> for pleasure , the <unk> will <unk> with joy .
But man — man , whom God created in his own image — man , upon whom God has laid his first , his sole <unk> , to love his neighbor — man , to whom God has given a voice to express his thoughts — what is his first cry when he hears his <unk> is saved ?
A <unk> .
Honor to man , this <unk> of nature , this king of the creation ! ” And the count burst into a laugh ; a terrible laugh , that showed he must have suffered horribly to be able thus to laugh .
However , the struggle still continued , and it was dreadful to witness .
The two <unk> carried Andrea up to the scaffold ; the people all took part against Andrea , and twenty thousand voices cried , “ <unk> him to death !
put him to death ! ” Franz sprang back , but the count seized his arm , and held him before the window .
“ What are you doing ? ” said he .
“ Do you pity him ?
If you heard the cry of ‘ <unk> dog ! ’ you would take your gun — you would <unk> <unk> the poor beast , who , after all , was only guilty of having been <unk> by another dog .
And yet you pity a man who , without being <unk> by one of his race , has yet murdered his benefactor ; and who , now unable to kill anyone , because his hands are bound , wishes to see his companion in <unk> <unk> .
No , no — look , look ! ” <unk> The <unk> was <unk> .
Franz was <unk> by the horrible spectacle .
The two <unk> had borne Andrea to the scaffold , and there , in spite of his <unk> , his <unk> , and his cries , had forced him to his knees .
During this time the executioner had raised his <unk> , and signed to them to get out of the way ; the criminal strove to rise , but , ere he had time , the <unk> fell on his left <unk> .
A dull and heavy sound was heard , and the man dropped like an <unk> on his face , and then turned over on his back .
The executioner let fall his <unk> , drew his knife , and with one stroke opened his throat , and <unk> on his stomach , stamped violently on it with his feet .
At every stroke a <unk> of blood sprang from the wound .
This time Franz could contain himself no longer , but sank , half <unk> , into a seat .
Albert , with his eyes closed , was standing <unk> the <unk> .
The count was erect and triumphant , like the <unk> <unk> !
Chapter <unk> .
The Carnival at Rome When Franz recovered his senses , he saw Albert drinking a glass of water , of which , to judge from his pallor , he stood in great need ; and the count , who was <unk> his <unk> costume .
He glanced mechanically towards the <unk> — the scene was wholly changed ; scaffold , <unk> , <unk> , all had disappeared ; only the people remained , full of noise and excitement .
The bell of Monte <unk> , which only sounds on the <unk> ’ s <unk> and the opening of the Carnival , was <unk> a joyous <unk> .
“ Well , ” asked he of the count , “ what has , then , happened ? ” “ Nothing , ” replied the count ; “ only , as you see , the Carnival has <unk> .
Make haste and dress yourself . ” “ In fact , ” said Franz , “ this horrible scene has passed away like a dream . ” “ It is but a dream , a <unk> , that has disturbed you . ” “ Yes , that I have suffered ; but the <unk> ? ” “ That is a dream also ; only he has remained asleep , while you have awakened ; and who knows which of you is the most fortunate ? ” “ But Peppino — what has become of him ? ” “ Peppino is a lad of sense , who , unlike most men , who are happy in proportion as they are noticed , was delighted to see that the general attention was directed towards his companion .
He <unk> by this <unk> to slip away among the crowd , without even <unk> the worthy priests who accompanied him .
<unk> man is an <unk> and <unk> animal .
But dress yourself ; see , M. de Morcerf <unk> you the example . ” Albert was drawing on the satin <unk> over his black trousers and <unk> boots .
“ Well , Albert , ” said Franz , “ do you feel much inclined to join the <unk> ?
Come , answer <unk> . ” “ _ Ma foi _ , no , ” returned Albert .
“ But I am really glad to have seen such a sight ; and I understand what the count said — that when you have once <unk> yourself to a similar spectacle , it is the only one that causes you any emotion . ” <unk> “ Without <unk> that this is the only moment in which you can study character , ” said the count ; “ on the steps of the scaffold death tears off the mask that has been worn through life , and the real visage is <unk> .
It must be allowed that Andrea was not very handsome , the hideous <unk> !
Come , dress yourselves , gentlemen , dress yourselves . ” Franz felt it would be ridiculous not to follow his two companions ’ example .
He assumed his costume , and fastened on the mask that scarcely <unk> the pallor of his own face .
Their toilet finished , they descended ; the carriage awaited them at the door , filled with <unk> and <unk> .
They fell into the line of carriages .
It is difficult to form an idea of the perfect change that had taken place .
<unk> of the spectacle of gloomy and silent death , the Piazza del <unk> presented a spectacle of gay and <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
A crowd of <unk> flowed in from all sides , <unk> from the doors , descending from the windows .
From every street and every corner drove carriages filled with <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and peasants , <unk> , fighting , <unk> , throwing <unk> filled with <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , with their <unk> and their <unk> , friends and <unk> , companions and strangers , <unk> , and no one took offence , or did anything but laugh .
Franz and Albert were like men who , to drive away a violent sorrow , have <unk> to wine , and who , as they drink and become intoxicated , feel a thick veil drawn between the past and the present .
They saw , or rather continued to see , the image of what they had witnessed ; but little by little the general <unk> seized them , and they felt themselves obliged to take part in the noise and confusion .
A handful of <unk> that came from a neighboring carriage , and which , while it covered Morcerf and his two companions with dust , <unk> his neck and that portion of his face <unk> by his mask like a hundred <unk> , <unk> him to join in the general combat , in which all the <unk> around him were engaged .
He rose in his turn , and seizing <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , with which the carriage was filled , cast them with all the force and skill he was master of .
<unk> The <unk> had fairly begun , and the recollection of what they had seen half an hour before was gradually <unk> from the young men ’ s minds , so much were they occupied by the gay and <unk> procession they now beheld .
As for the Count of Monte Cristo , he had never for an instant shown any appearance of having been moved .
<unk> the large and splendid <unk> , bordered from one end to the other with lofty <unk> , with their <unk> hung with <unk> , and their windows with <unk> .
At these <unk> are three hundred thousand spectators — <unk> , <unk> , strangers from all parts of the world , the united <unk> of birth , wealth , and genius .
<unk> women , <unk> to the influence of the scene , bend over their <unk> , or <unk> from their windows , and <unk> down <unk> , which are returned by <unk> ; the air seems <unk> with the falling <unk> and flying flowers .
In the streets the lively crowd is dressed in the most fantastic <unk> — gigantic <unk> walk gravely about , <unk> ’ heads <unk> from men ’ s shoulders , dogs walk on their <unk> legs ; in the midst of all this a mask is lifted , and , as in <unk> ’ s <unk> of St. <unk> , a lovely face is exhibited , which we would <unk> follow , but from which we are separated by troops of <unk> .
This will give a faint idea of the Carnival at Rome .
At the second turn , the count stopped the carriage , and requested permission to <unk> , leaving the vehicle at their disposal .
Franz looked up — they were opposite the <unk> <unk> .
At the centre window , the one hung with white damask with a red cross , was a blue <unk> , beneath which Franz ’ s imagination easily <unk> the beautiful Greek of the <unk> .
“ Gentlemen , ” said the count , <unk> out , “ when you are tired of being <unk> , and wish to become spectators of this scene , you know you have places at my windows .
In the meantime , <unk> of my coachman , my carriage , and my servants . ” We have forgotten to mention , that the count ’ s coachman was <unk> in a <unk> , exactly resembling <unk> ’ s in _ The <unk> and the <unk> _ ; and the two <unk> behind were dressed up as green <unk> , with spring <unk> , with which they made <unk> at everyone who passed .
Franz thanked the count for his attention .
As for Albert , he was <unk> occupied throwing <unk> at a carriage full of Roman peasants that was passing near him .
<unk> for him , the line of carriages moved on again , and while he descended the Piazza del <unk> , the other ascended towards the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
“ Ah , my dear fellow , ” said he to Franz ; “ you did not see ? ” “ What ? ” “ There , — that <unk> filled with Roman peasants . ” “ No . ” “ Well , I am convinced they are all charming women . ” “ How unfortunate that you were masked , Albert , ” said Franz ; “ here was an opportunity of making up for past <unk> . ” “ Oh , ” replied he , half laughing , half serious ; “ I hope the Carnival will not pass without some <unk> in one shape or the other . ” But , in spite of Albert ’ s hope , the day passed <unk> by any incident , excepting two or three <unk> with the carriage full of Roman peasants .
At one of these <unk> , <unk> or <unk> , Albert ’ s mask fell off .
He instantly rose and cast the <unk> of the <unk> into the carriage .
<unk> one of the charming <unk> Albert had <unk> beneath their <unk> disguise was touched by his gallantry ; for , as the carriage of the two friends passed her , she threw a bunch of <unk> .
Albert seized it , and as Franz had no reason to suppose it was meant for him , he suffered Albert to retain it .
Albert placed it in his <unk> , and the carriage went <unk> on .
“ Well , ” said Franz to him ; “ there is the beginning of an adventure . ” “ <unk> if you please — I really think so .
So I will not abandon this <unk> . ” “ _ <unk> _ , ” returned Franz , laughing , “ in <unk> of your <unk> . ” The jest , however , soon appeared to become earnest ; for when Albert and Franz again encountered the carriage with the _ <unk> _ , the one who had thrown the <unk> to Albert , <unk> her hands when she beheld them in his <unk> .
“ <unk> , <unk> , ” said Franz ; “ things go <unk> .
Shall I leave you ?
Perhaps you would prefer being alone ? ” “ No , ” replied he ; “ I will not be caught like a fool at a first <unk> by a <unk> under the clock , as they say at the <unk> .
If the fair peasant wishes to carry matters any further , we shall find her , or rather , she will find us tomorrow ; then she will give me some sign or other , and I shall know what I have to do . ” “ On my word , ” said Franz , “ you are as wise as <unk> and prudent as <unk> , and your fair <unk> must be very skilful or very powerful if she succeed in changing you into a beast of any kind . ” Albert was right ; the fair unknown had resolved , doubtless , to carry the <unk> no farther ; for although the young men made several more turns , they did not again see the <unk> , which had turned up one of the neighboring streets .
Then they returned to the <unk> <unk> ; but the count and the blue <unk> had also disappeared ; the two windows , hung with yellow damask , were still occupied by the persons whom the count had invited .
At this moment the same bell that had <unk> the beginning of the <unk> sounded the retreat .
The file on the <unk> broke the line , and in a second all the carriages had disappeared .
Franz and Albert were opposite the <unk> <unk> <unk> ; the coachman , without saying a word , drove up it , passed along the Piazza <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and stopped at the door of the hotel .
Signor Pastrini came to the door to receive his guests .
Franz hastened to inquire after the count , and to express regret that he had not returned in sufficient time ; but Pastrini reassured him by saying that the Count of Monte Cristo had ordered a second carriage for himself , and that it had gone at four o ’ clock to fetch him from the <unk> <unk> .
The count had , moreover , charged him to offer the two friends the key of his box at the <unk> .
Franz questioned Albert as to his intentions ; but Albert had great projects to put into execution before going to the theatre ; and instead of making any answer , he inquired if Signor Pastrini could procure him a <unk> .
“ A <unk> , ” said the host ; “ and for what ? ” “ To make us between now and tomorrow two Roman peasant <unk> , ” returned Albert .
The host shook his head .
“ To make you two <unk> between now and tomorrow ?
I ask your <unk> ’ pardon , but this is quite a French demand ; for the next week you will not find a single <unk> who would consent to <unk> six <unk> on a waistcoat if you paid him a crown a piece for each <unk> . ” “ Then I must give up the idea ? ” “ No ; we have them <unk> .
Leave all to me ; and tomorrow , when you awake , you shall find a collection of <unk> with which you will be satisfied . ” “ My dear Albert , ” said Franz , “ leave all to our host ; he has already proved himself full of resources ; let us dine quietly , and afterwards go and see _ l ’ <unk> à <unk> ! _ “ <unk> , ” returned Albert ; “ but remember , Signor Pastrini , that both my friend and myself attach the greatest importance to having tomorrow the <unk> we have asked for . ” The host again assured them they might rely on him , and that their wishes should be attended to ; upon which Franz and Albert mounted to their apartments , and proceeded to <unk> themselves of their <unk> .
Albert , as he took off his dress , carefully preserved the bunch of <unk> ; it was his <unk> reserved for the morrow .
The two friends sat down to table ; but they could not refrain from <unk> the difference between the Count of Monte Cristo ’ s table and that of Signor Pastrini .
<unk> compelled Franz , in spite of the dislike he seemed to have taken to the count , to confess that the advantage was not on Pastrini ’ s side .
During <unk> , the servant inquired at what time they wished for the carriage .
Albert and Franz looked at each other , fearing really to <unk> the count ’ s kindness .
The servant understood them .
“ His excellency the Count of Monte Cristo had , ” he said , “ given <unk> orders that the carriage was to remain at their <unk> ’ orders all day , and they could therefore <unk> of it without fear of <unk> . ” They resolved to profit by the count ’ s <unk> , and ordered the horses to be <unk> , while they <unk> evening dress for that which they had on , and which was somewhat the worse for the numerous <unk> they had sustained .
<unk> This precaution taken , they went to the theatre , and <unk> themselves in the count ’ s box .
During the first act , the <unk> G — — entered .
Her first look was at the box where she had seen the count the previous evening , so that she perceived Franz and Albert in the place of the very person concerning whom she had expressed so strange an opinion to Franz .
Her <unk> was so <unk> directed towards them , that Franz saw it would be cruel not to satisfy her curiosity ; and , <unk> himself of one of the <unk> of the spectators of the Italian <unk> , who use their boxes to hold <unk> , the two friends went to pay their respects to the countess .
<unk> had they entered , when she motioned to Franz to assume the seat of honor .
Albert , in his turn , sat behind .
“ Well , ” said she , hardly giving Franz time to sit down , “ it seems you have nothing better to do than to make the acquaintance of this new Lord <unk> , and you are already the best friends in the world . ” “ Without being so far advanced as that , my dear countess , ” returned Franz , “ I cannot deny that we have <unk> his good nature all day . ” “ All day ? ” “ Yes ; this morning we <unk> with him ; we <unk> in his carriage all day , and now we have taken possession of his box . ” “ You know him , then ? ” “ Yes , and no . ” “ How so ? ” “ It is a long story . ” “ Tell it to me . ” “ It would <unk> you too much . ” “ So much the more reason . ” “ At least wait until the story has a conclusion . ” “ Very well ; I prefer complete <unk> ; but tell me how you made his acquaintance ?
Did anyone introduce you to him ? ” “ No ; it was he who introduced himself to us . ” “ When ? ” “ Last night , after we left you . ” “ Through what medium ? ” “ The very <unk> one of our landlord . ” “ He is staying , then , at the Hôtel de <unk> with you ? ” “ Not only in the same hotel , but on the same floor . ” “ What is his name ; for , of course , you know ? ” “ The Count of Monte Cristo . ” “ That is not a family name ? ” “ No , it is the name of the island he has purchased . ” “ And he is a count ? ” “ A <unk> count . ” “ Well , we must put up with that , ” said the countess , who was herself from one of the <unk> <unk> families .
“ What sort of a man is he ? ” “ <unk> the <unk> de Morcerf . ” “ You hear , M. de Morcerf , I am <unk> to you , ” said the countess .
“ We should be very hard to please , <unk> , ” returned Albert , “ did we not think him delightful .
A friend of ten years ’ standing could not have done more for us , or with a more perfect <unk> . ” “ Come , ” observed the countess , smiling , “ I see my <unk> is only some <unk> , who has taken the appearance of <unk> in order to avoid being <unk> with M. de <unk> ; and you have seen her ? ” “ Her ? ” <unk> “ The beautiful Greek of yesterday . ” “ No ; we heard , I think , the sound of her _ <unk> _ , but she remained perfectly invisible . ” “ When you say invisible , ” interrupted Albert , “ it is only to keep up the mystery ; for whom do you take the blue <unk> at the window with the white curtains ? ” “ Where was this window with white <unk> ? ” asked the countess .
“ At the <unk> <unk> . ” “ The count had three windows at the <unk> <unk> ? ” “ Yes .
Did you pass through the <unk> ? ” “ Yes . ” “ Well , did you notice two windows hung with yellow damask , and one with white damask with a red cross ?
Those were the count ’ s windows . ” “ Why , he must be a <unk> .
Do you know what those three windows were worth ? ” “ Two or three hundred Roman crowns ? ” “ Two or three thousand . ” “ The deuce ! ” “ Does his island produce him such a <unk> ? ” “ It does not bring him a <unk> . ” “ Then why did he purchase it ? ” “ For a <unk> . ” “ He is an original , then ? ” “ In reality , ” observed Albert , “ he seemed to me somewhat eccentric ; were he at Paris , and a <unk> of the <unk> , I should say he was a poor devil <unk> mad .
This morning he made two or three <unk> worthy of <unk> or <unk> . ” At this moment a fresh visitor entered , and , according to custom , Franz gave up his seat to him .
This circumstance had , moreover , the effect of changing the conversation ; an hour afterwards the two friends returned to their hotel .
Signor Pastrini had already set about <unk> their <unk> for the morrow ; and he assured them that they would be perfectly satisfied .
The next morning , at nine o ’ clock , he entered Franz ’ s room , followed by a <unk> , who had eight or ten Roman peasant <unk> on his arm ; they selected two exactly <unk> , and charged the <unk> to <unk> on each of their <unk> about twenty <unk> of ribbon , and to procure them two of the long silk <unk> of different colors with which the lower orders <unk> themselves on <unk> days .
Albert was impatient to see how he looked in his new dress — a <unk> and <unk> of blue velvet , silk stockings with <unk> , shoes with <unk> , and a silk waistcoat .
This picturesque <unk> set him off to great advantage ; and when he had bound the <unk> around his waist , and when his hat , placed <unk> on one side , let fall on his shoulder a stream of <unk> , Franz was forced to confess that costume has much to do with the physical superiority we accord to certain nations .
The <unk> used to be so picturesque with their long and <unk> <unk> , but are they not now hideous with their blue <unk> <unk> up to the chin , and their red <unk> , which make them look like a bottle of wine with a red <unk> ?
Franz <unk> Albert , who looked at himself in the glass with an <unk> smile of satisfaction .
They were thus engaged when the Count of Monte Cristo entered .
<unk> “ Gentlemen , ” said he , “ although a companion is agreeable , perfect freedom is sometimes still more agreeable .
I come to say that today , and for the <unk> of the Carnival , I leave the carriage entirely at your disposal .
The host will tell you I have three or four more , so that you will not inconvenience me in any way .
Make use of it , I pray you , for your pleasure or your business . ” The young men wished to <unk> , but they could find no good reason for <unk> an offer which was so agreeable to them .
The Count of Monte Cristo remained a quarter of an hour with them , conversing on all subjects with the greatest ease .
He was , as we have already said , perfectly well acquainted with the <unk> of all countries .
A glance at the walls of his salon proved to Franz and Albert that he was a <unk> of <unk> .
A few words he let fall showed them that he was no stranger to the <unk> , and he seemed much occupied with <unk> .
The two friends did not venture to return the count the breakfast he had given them ; it would have been too absurd to offer him in exchange for his excellent table the very inferior one of Signor Pastrini .
They told him so <unk> , and he received their <unk> with the air of a man who <unk> their delicacy .
Albert was <unk> with the count ’ s manners , and he was only prevented from <unk> him for a perfect gentleman by reason of his varied knowledge .
The permission to do what he liked with the carriage pleased him above all , for the fair peasants had appeared in a most elegant carriage the preceding evening , and Albert was not sorry to be upon an equal <unk> with them .
At half-past one they descended , the coachman and <unk> had put on their <unk> over their <unk> , which gave them a more ridiculous appearance than ever , and which gained them the <unk> of Franz and Albert .
Albert had fastened the <unk> bunch of <unk> to his <unk> .
At the first sound of the bell they hastened into the <unk> by the <unk> <unk> .
At the second turn , a bunch of fresh <unk> , thrown from a carriage filled with <unk> , indicated to Albert that , like himself and his friend , the peasants had changed their costume also ; and whether it was the result of chance , or whether a similar feeling had possessed them both , while he had <unk> their costume , they had assumed his .
Albert placed the fresh <unk> in his <unk> , but he kept the <unk> one in his hand ; and when he again met the <unk> , he raised it to his lips , an action which seemed greatly to amuse not only the fair lady who had thrown it , but her joyous companions also .
The day was as gay as the preceding one , perhaps even more animated and <unk> ; the count appeared for an instant at his window , but when they again passed he had disappeared .
It is almost <unk> to say that the <unk> between Albert and the fair peasant continued all day .
In the evening , on his return , Franz found a letter from the <unk> , <unk> him that he would have the honor of being received by his <unk> the next day .
At each previous visit he had made to Rome , he had <unk> and obtained the same favor ; and <unk> as much by a religious feeling as by gratitude , he was unwilling to quit the capital of the Christian world without laying his respectful <unk> at the feet of one of St. <unk> ’ s <unk> who has set the rare example of all the virtues .
He did not then think of the Carnival , for in spite of his <unk> and touching kindness , one cannot <unk> one ’ s self without <unk> before the venerable and noble old man called <unk> <unk> .
On his return from the <unk> , Franz carefully avoided the <unk> ; he brought away with him a treasure of <unk> thoughts , to which the mad gayety of the <unk> would have been <unk> .
At ten minutes past five Albert entered <unk> .
The <unk> had <unk> her peasant ’ s costume , and as she passed she raised her mask .
She was charming .
Franz <unk> Albert , who received his <unk> with the air of a man conscious that they are <unk> .
He had recognized by certain <unk> signs , that his fair _ <unk> _ belonged to the <unk> .
He had made up his mind to write to her the next day .
Franz remarked , while he gave these details , that Albert seemed to have something to ask of him , but that he was unwilling to ask it .
He insisted upon it , <unk> beforehand that he was willing to make any sacrifice the other wished .
Albert let himself be pressed just as long as friendship required , and then <unk> to Franz that he would do him a great favor by allowing him to occupy the carriage alone the next day .
Albert attributed to Franz ’ s absence the extreme kindness of the fair peasant in raising her mask .
Franz was not sufficiently <unk> to stop Albert in the middle of an adventure that promised to prove so agreeable to his curiosity and so <unk> to his vanity .
He felt assured that the perfect <unk> of his friend would <unk> inform him of all that happened ; and as , during three years that he had travelled all over Italy , a similar piece of good fortune had never fallen to his share , Franz was by no means sorry to learn how to act on such an occasion .
He therefore promised Albert that he would content himself the morrow with <unk> the Carnival from the windows of the <unk> <unk> .
The next morning he saw Albert pass and <unk> , holding an enormous <unk> , which he doubtless meant to make the <unk> of his <unk> <unk> .
This belief was changed into certainty when Franz saw the <unk> ( <unk> by a circle of white <unk> ) in the hand of a charming <unk> dressed in <unk> satin .
The evening was no longer joy , but delirium .
Albert nothing doubted but that the fair unknown would reply in the same manner .
Franz anticipated his wishes by saying that the noise fatigued him , and that he should pass the next day in writing and looking over his journal .
Albert was not deceived , for the next evening Franz saw him enter <unk> shaking a folded paper which he held by one corner .
“ Well , ” said he , “ was I mistaken ? ” “ She has answered you ! ” cried Franz .
“ <unk> . ” This word was pronounced in a manner impossible to describe .
Franz took the letter , and read : “ Tuesday evening , at seven o ’ clock , descend from your carriage opposite the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and follow the Roman peasant who <unk> your torch from you .
When you arrive at the first step of the church of <unk> <unk> , be sure to <unk> a <unk> of <unk> <unk> to the shoulder of your <unk> costume , in order that you may be recognized .
<unk> then you will not see me .
— <unk> and <unk> . ” “ Well , ” asked he , when Franz had finished , “ what do you think of that ? ” “ I think that the adventure is <unk> a very agreeable appearance . ” “ I think so , also , ” replied Albert ; “ and I very much fear you will go alone to the <unk> of <unk> ’ s ball . ” Franz and Albert had received that morning an invitation from the celebrated Roman banker .
“ Take care , Albert , ” said Franz .
“ All the nobility of Rome will be present , and if your fair _ <unk> _ belong to the higher class of society , she must go there . ” “ Whether she goes there or not , my opinion is still the same , ” returned Albert .
“ You have read the letter ? ” “ Yes . ” “ You know how <unk> the women of the _ <unk> <unk> _ are <unk> in Italy ? ” ( This is the name of the lower class . )
“ Yes . ” “ Well , read the letter again .
Look at the writing , and find if you can , any <unk> in the language or <unk> . ” The writing was , in reality , charming , and the <unk> <unk> .
“ You are born to good fortune , ” said Franz , as he returned the letter .
“ <unk> as much as you will , ” replied Albert , “ I am in love . ” “ You alarm me , ” cried Franz .
“ I see that I shall not only go alone to the <unk> of <unk> ’ s , but also return to <unk> alone . ” “ If my unknown be as amiable as she is beautiful , ” said Albert , “ I shall fix myself at Rome for six weeks , at least .
I adore Rome , and I have always had a great taste for <unk> . ” <unk> “ Come , two or three more such adventures , and I do not despair of seeing you a member of the <unk> . ” <unk> Albert was about to <unk> seriously his right to the <unk> chair when they were informed that dinner was ready .
Albert ’ s love had not taken away his appetite .
He hastened with Franz to seat himself , free to <unk> the discussion after dinner .
After dinner , the Count of Monte Cristo was announced .
They had not seen him for two days .
Signor Pastrini informed them that business had called him to <unk> <unk> .
He had started the previous evening , and had only returned an hour since .
He was charming .
Whether he kept a watch over himself , or whether by accident he did not sound the <unk> <unk> that in other circumstances had been touched , he was tonight like everybody else .
The man was an <unk> to Franz .
The count must feel sure that Franz recognized him ; and yet he had not let fall a single word <unk> any previous acquaintance between them .
On his side , however great Franz ’ s desire was to <unk> to their former interview , the fear of being disagreeable to the man who had loaded him and his friend with kindness prevented him from <unk> it .
The count had learned that the two friends had sent to secure a box at the <unk> <unk> , and were told they were all let .
In consequence , he brought them the key of his own — at least such was the apparent motive of his visit .
Franz and Albert made some difficulty , <unk> their fear of <unk> him of it ; but the count replied that , as he was going to the <unk> <unk> , the box at the <unk> <unk> would be lost if they did not profit by it .
This assurance determined the two friends to accept it .
Franz had by degrees become accustomed to the count ’ s pallor , which had so <unk> struck him at their first meeting .
He could not refrain from <unk> the severe beauty of his features , the only defect , or rather the principal quality of which was the pallor .
<unk> , a <unk> hero !
Franz could not , we will not say see him , but even think of him without <unk> his stern head upon <unk> ’ s shoulders , or beneath <unk> ’ s <unk> .
His forehead was marked with the line that <unk> the constant presence of bitter thoughts ; he had the <unk> eyes that seem to penetrate to the very soul , and the haughty and <unk> upper lip that gives to the words it <unk> a peculiar character that <unk> them on the minds of those to whom they are addressed .
The count was no longer young .
He was at least forty ; and yet it was easy to understand that he was formed to rule the young men with whom he associated at present .
And , to complete his resemblance with the fantastic heroes of the English poet , the count seemed to have the power of <unk> .
Albert was constantly <unk> on their good fortune in meeting such a man .
Franz was less enthusiastic ; but the count exercised over him also the <unk> a strong mind always <unk> over a mind less <unk> .
He thought several times of the project the count had of visiting Paris ; and he had no doubt but that , with his eccentric character , his characteristic face , and his colossal fortune , he would produce a great effect there .
And yet he did not wish to be at Paris when the count was there .
The evening passed as <unk> <unk> pass at Italian <unk> ; that is , not in listening to the music , but in paying visits and conversing .
The <unk> G — — wished to <unk> the subject of the count , but Franz announced he had something far <unk> to tell her , and , in spite of Albert ’ s <unk> of false modesty , he informed the countess of the great event which had <unk> them for the last three days .
As similar <unk> are not <unk> in Italy , if we may credit travellers , the <unk> did not <unk> the least <unk> , but <unk> Albert on his success .
They promised , upon <unk> , to meet at the <unk> of <unk> ’ s ball , to which all Rome was invited .
The <unk> of the <unk> kept her word ; she gave Albert no sign of her existence the morrow or the day after .
At length Tuesday came , the last and most <unk> day of the Carnival .
On Tuesday , the <unk> open at ten o ’ clock in the morning , as <unk> begins after eight at night .
On Tuesday , all those who through want of money , time , or enthusiasm , have not been to see the Carnival before , <unk> in the gayety , and <unk> to the noise and excitement .
From two o ’ clock till five Franz and Albert followed in the _ <unk> _ , <unk> <unk> of _ <unk> _ with the other carriages and the <unk> , who <unk> amongst the horses ’ feet and the carriage wheels without a single accident , a single <unk> , or a single fight .
The _ <unk> _ are <unk> pleasure days to the <unk> .
The author of this history , who has <unk> five or six years in Italy , does not recollect to have ever seen a ceremony interrupted by one of those events so common in other countries .
Albert was triumphant in his <unk> costume .
A <unk> of <unk> <unk> fell from his shoulder almost to the ground .
In order that there might be no confusion , Franz wore his peasant ’ s costume .
As the day advanced , the tumult became greater .
There was not on the pavement , in the carriages , at the windows , a single tongue that was silent , a single arm that did not move .
It was a human storm , made up of a thunder of cries , and a <unk> of <unk> , flowers , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
At three o ’ clock the sound of <unk> , let off on the Piazza del <unk> and the Piazza <unk> <unk> ( heard with difficulty amid the <unk> and confusion ) announced that the <unk> were about to begin .
The <unk> , like the _ <unk> _ , are one of the <unk> peculiar to the last days of the Carnival .
At the sound of the <unk> the carriages instantly broke ranks , and retired by the <unk> streets .
All these <unk> are executed with an <unk> address and marvellous rapidity , without the police <unk> in the matter .
The <unk> <unk> themselves against the walls ; then the <unk> of horses and the <unk> of steel were heard .
A <unk> of <unk> , fifteen <unk> , <unk> up the <unk> in order to clear it for the _ <unk> _ .
When the <unk> arrived at the Piazza <unk> <unk> , a second <unk> of <unk> was discharged , to announce that the street was clear .
<unk> instantly , in the midst of a tremendous and general <unk> , seven or eight horses , excited by the shouts of three hundred thousand spectators , passed by like lightning .
Then the <unk> of Saint <unk> fired three cannon to indicate that number three had won .
<unk> , without any other signal , the carriages moved on , <unk> on towards the <unk> , down all the streets , like <unk> <unk> up for a while , which again flow into the <unk> river ; and the immense stream again continued its course between its two granite banks .
A new source of noise and movement was added to the crowd .
The <unk> of _ <unk> _ entered on the scene .
The _ <unk> _ , or _ <unk> _ , are candles which <unk> in size from the <unk> <unk> to the <unk> , and which give to each <unk> in the great final scene of the Carnival two very serious <unk> to <unk> with , — first , how to keep his own _ <unk> _ <unk> ; and <unk> , how to <unk> the _ <unk> _ of others .
The _ <unk> _ is like life : man has found but one means of <unk> it , and that one comes from God .
But he has discovered a thousand means of taking it away , and the devil has somewhat <unk> him .
The _ <unk> _ is <unk> by approaching it to a light .
But who can describe the thousand means of <unk> the _ <unk> _ ? — the gigantic <unk> , the monstrous <unk> , the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> hastened to purchase _ <unk> _ — Franz and Albert among the rest .
The night was rapidly approaching ; and already , at the cry of “ _ <unk> _ ! ” repeated by the <unk> voices of a thousand <unk> , two or three stars began to burn among the crowd .
It was a signal .
At the end of ten minutes fifty thousand lights <unk> , descending from the <unk> <unk> <unk> to the Piazza del <unk> , and <unk> from the Piazza del <unk> to the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It seemed like the _ <unk> _ of <unk> ’ <unk> .
It is impossible to form any idea of it without having seen it .
<unk> that all the stars had descended from the sky and mingled in a wild dance on the face of the earth ; the whole accompanied by cries that were never heard in any other part of the world .
The _ <unk> _ follows the prince , the <unk> the citizen , everyone blowing , <unk> , <unk> .
Had old <unk> appeared at this moment , he would have been <unk> king of the _ <unk> _ , and <unk> the <unk> to the throne .
This battle of folly and flame continued for two hours ; the <unk> was light as day ; the features of the spectators on the third and fourth stories were visible .
Every five minutes Albert took out his watch ; at length it pointed to seven .
The two friends were in the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Albert sprang out , bearing his _ <unk> _ in his hand .
Two or three <unk> strove to knock his _ <unk> _ out of his hand ; but Albert , a <unk> <unk> , sent them rolling in the street , one after the other , and continued his course towards the church of <unk> <unk> .
The steps were <unk> with <unk> , who strove to <unk> each other ’ s <unk> .
Franz followed Albert with his eyes , and saw him <unk> the first step .
<unk> a mask , wearing the <unk> costume of a peasant woman , <unk> his _ <unk> _ from him without his offering any resistance .
Franz was too far off to hear what they said ; but , without doubt , nothing <unk> passed , for he saw Albert disappear <unk> with the peasant girl .
He watched them pass through the crowd for some time , but at length he lost sight of them in the <unk> <unk> .
Suddenly the bell that gives the signal for the end of the Carnival sounded , and at the same instant all the _ <unk> _ were extinguished as if by <unk> .
It seemed as though one immense <unk> of the wind had extinguished everyone .
Franz found himself in utter darkness .
No sound was audible save that of the carriages that were carrying the <unk> home ; nothing was visible save a few lights that burnt behind the windows .
The Carnival was over .
<unk> Chapter <unk> .
The <unk> of Saint <unk> In his whole life , perhaps , Franz had never before experienced so sudden an impression , so rapid a <unk> from gayety to sadness , as in this moment .
It seemed as though Rome , under the <unk> breath of some <unk> of the night , had suddenly changed into a vast tomb .
By a chance , which added yet more to the <unk> of the darkness , the moon , which was on the <unk> , did not rise until eleven o ’ clock , and the streets which the young man traversed were plunged in the <unk> obscurity .
The distance was short , and at the end of ten minutes his carriage , or rather the count ’ s , stopped before the Hôtel de <unk> .
<unk> was waiting , but as Albert had told him that he should not return so soon , Franz sat down without him .
Signor Pastrini , who had been accustomed to see them dine together , inquired into the cause of his absence , but Franz merely replied that Albert had received on the previous evening an invitation which he had accepted .
The sudden <unk> of the _ <unk> _ , the darkness which had replaced the light , and the silence which had succeeded the <unk> , had left in Franz ’ s mind a certain <unk> which was not free from uneasiness .
He therefore dined very silently , in spite of the <unk> attention of his host , who presented himself two or three times to inquire if he wanted anything .
Franz resolved to wait for Albert as late as possible .
He ordered the carriage , therefore , for eleven o ’ clock , <unk> Signor Pastrini to inform him the moment that Albert returned to the hotel .
At eleven o ’ clock Albert had not come back .
Franz dressed himself , and went out , telling his host that he was going to pass the night at the <unk> of <unk> ’ s .
The house of the <unk> of <unk> is one of the most delightful in Rome , the <unk> , one of the last <unk> of the <unk> , does its <unk> with the most <unk> grace , and thus their _ <unk> _ have a <unk> <unk> .
Franz and Albert had brought to Rome letters of introduction to them , and their first question on his arrival was to inquire the <unk> of his travelling companion .
Franz replied that he had left him at the moment they were about to <unk> the _ <unk> _ , and that he had lost sight of him in the <unk> <unk> .
“ Then he has not returned ? ” said the duke .
“ I waited for him until this hour , ” replied Franz .
“ And do you know whither he went ? ” “ No , not precisely ; however , I think it was something very like a <unk> . ” “ _ <unk> ! _ ” said the duke , “ this is a bad day , or rather a bad night , to be out late ; is it not , countess ? ” These words were addressed to the <unk> G — — , who had just arrived , and was leaning on the arm of Signor <unk> , the duke ’ s brother .
“ I think , on the contrary , that it is a charming night , ” replied the countess , “ and those who are here will complain of but one thing , that of its too rapid flight . ” “ I am not speaking , ” said the duke with a smile , “ of the persons who are here ; the men run no other danger than that of falling in love with you , and the women of falling ill of jealousy at seeing you so lovely ; I meant persons who were out in the streets of Rome . ” “ Ah , ” asked the countess , “ who is out in the streets of Rome at this hour , unless it be to go to a ball ? ” “ Our friend , Albert de Morcerf , countess , whom I left in pursuit of his unknown about seven o ’ clock this evening , ” said Franz , “ and whom I have not seen since . ” “ And don ’ t you know where he is ? ” “ Not at all . ” “ Is he armed ? ” “ He is in <unk> . ” “ You should not have allowed him to go , ” said the duke to Franz ; “ you , who know Rome better than he does . ” “ You might as well have tried to stop number three of the _ <unk> _ , who gained the <unk> in the race today , ” replied Franz ; “ and then moreover , what could happen to him ? ” “ Who can tell ?
The night is gloomy , and the <unk> is very near the <unk> <unk> . ” Franz felt a shudder run through his veins at observing that the feeling of the duke and the countess was so much in <unk> with his own personal <unk> .
“ I informed them at the hotel that I had the honor of passing the night here , duke , ” said Franz , “ and desired them to come and inform me of his return . ” “ Ah , ” replied the duke , “ here I think , is one of my servants who is seeking you . ” The duke was not mistaken ; when he saw Franz , the servant came up to him .
“ Your excellency , ” he said , “ the master of the Hôtel de <unk> has sent to let you know that a man is waiting for you with a letter from the <unk> of Morcerf . ” “ A letter from the viscount ! ” exclaimed Franz .
“ Yes . ” “ And who is the man ? ” “ I do not know . ” “ Why did he not bring it to me here ? ” “ The messenger did not say . ” “ And where is the messenger ? ” “ He went away directly he saw me enter the <unk> to find you . ” “ Oh , ” said the countess to Franz , “ go with all speed — poor young man !
Perhaps some accident has happened to him . ” “ I will hasten , ” replied Franz .
“ Shall we see you again to give us any information ? ” inquired the countess .
“ Yes , if it is not any serious affair , otherwise I cannot answer as to what I may do myself . ” “ Be prudent , in any event , ” said the countess .
“ Oh !
pray be assured of that . ” Franz took his hat and went away in haste .
He had sent away his carriage with orders for it to fetch him at two o ’ clock ; fortunately the <unk> <unk> , which is on one side in the <unk> , and on the other in the Square of the Holy <unk> , is hardly ten minutes ’ walk from the Hôtel de <unk> .
As he came near the hotel , Franz saw a man in the middle of the street .
He had no doubt that it was the messenger from Albert .
The man was wrapped up in a large cloak .
He went up to him , but , to his extreme astonishment , the stranger first addressed him .
“ What wants your excellency of me ? ” inquired the man , retreating a step or two , as if to keep on his guard .
“ Are not you the person who brought me a letter , ” inquired Franz , “ from the <unk> of Morcerf ? ” “ Your excellency <unk> at Pastrini ’ s hotel ? ” “ I do . ” “ Your excellency is the travelling companion of the viscount ? ” “ I am . ” “ Your excellency ’ s name — — ” “ Is the Baron Franz d ’ Épinay . ” <unk> “ Then it is to your excellency that this letter is addressed . ” “ Is there any answer ? ” inquired Franz , taking the letter from him .
“ Yes — your friend at least hopes so . ” “ Come upstairs with me , and I will give it to you . ” “ I prefer waiting here , ” said the messenger , with a smile .
“ And why ? ” “ Your excellency will know when you have read the letter . ” “ Shall I find you here , then ? ” “ Certainly . ” Franz entered the hotel .
On the staircase he met Signor Pastrini .
“ Well ? ” said the landlord .
“ Well — what ? ” responded Franz .
“ You have seen the man who desired to speak with you from your friend ? ” he asked of Franz .
“ Yes , I have seen him , ” he replied , “ and he has handed this letter to me .
<unk> the candles in my apartment , if you please . ” The innkeeper gave orders to a servant to go before Franz with a light .
The young man had found Signor Pastrini looking very much alarmed , and this had only made him the more anxious to read Albert ’ s letter ; and so he went instantly towards the <unk> , and unfolded it .
It was written and signed by Albert .
Franz read it twice before he could comprehend what it contained .
It was thus <unk> : “ My dear <unk> , “ The moment you have received this , have the kindness to take the letter of credit from my pocket-book , which you will find in the square drawer of the _ <unk> _ ; add your own to it , if it be not sufficient .
<unk> to <unk> , draw from him instantly four thousand piastres , and give them to the <unk> .
It is <unk> that I should have this money without delay .
I do not say more , <unk> on you as you may rely on me .
“ Your friend , “ Albert de Morcerf .
“ <unk> — I now believe in Italian _ <unk> _ . ” <unk> these lines were written , in a strange hand , the following in Italian : “ _ <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> le <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> _ .
“ Luigi Vampa . ” “ _ If by six in the morning the four thousand piastres are not in my hands , by seven o ’ clock the Count Albert will have ceased to live _ . ” This second signature explained everything to Franz , who now understood the objection of the messenger to coming up into the apartment ; the street was <unk> for him .
Albert , then , had fallen into the hands of the famous bandit chief , in whose existence he had for so long a time refused to believe .
There was no time to lose .
He hastened to open the _ <unk> _ , and found the pocket-book in the drawer , and in it the letter of credit .
There were in all six thousand piastres , but of these six thousand Albert had already <unk> three thousand .
As to Franz , he had no letter of credit , as he lived at <unk> , and had only come to Rome to pass seven or eight days ; he had brought but a hundred louis , and of these he had not more than fifty left .
Thus seven or eight hundred piastres were wanting to them both to make up the sum that Albert required .
True , he might in such a case rely on the kindness of Signor <unk> .
He was , therefore , about to return to the <unk> <unk> without loss of time , when suddenly a luminous idea crossed his mind .
He remembered the Count of Monte Cristo .
Franz was about to ring for Signor Pastrini , when that worthy presented himself .
“ My dear sir , ” he said , hastily , “ do you know if the count is within ? ” “ Yes , your excellency ; he has this moment returned . ” “ Is he in bed ? ” “ I should say no . ” “ Then ring at his door , if you please , and request him to be so kind as to give me an audience . ” Signor Pastrini did as he was desired , and returning five minutes after , he said : “ The count <unk> your excellency . ” Franz went along the corridor , and a servant introduced him to the count .
He was in a small room which Franz had not yet seen , and which was surrounded with <unk> .
The count came towards him .
“ Well , what good wind blows you hither at this hour ? ” said he ; “ have you come to <unk> with me ?
It would be very kind of you . ” “ No ; I have come to speak to you of a very serious matter . ” “ A serious matter , ” said the count , looking at Franz with the <unk> usual to him ; “ and what may it be ? ” “ Are we alone ? ” “ Yes , ” replied the count , going to the door , and returning .
Franz gave him Albert ’ s letter .
“ <unk> that , ” he said .
The count read it .
“ Well , well ! ” said he .
“ Did you see the <unk> ? ” “ I did , indeed .
“ _ ‘ <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> le <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
_ “ ‘ Luigi Vampa . ’ ” “ What think you of that ? ” inquired Franz .
“ Have you the money he demands ? ” “ Yes , all but eight hundred piastres . ” The count went to his _ <unk> _ , opened it , and <unk> out a drawer filled with gold , said to Franz , “ I hope you will not <unk> me by <unk> to anyone but myself . ” “ You see , on the contrary , I come to you first and instantly , ” replied Franz .
“ And I thank you ; have what you will ; ” and he made a sign to Franz to take what he pleased .
“ Is it absolutely necessary , then , to send the money to Luigi Vampa ? ” asked the young man , looking <unk> in his turn at the count .
“ <unk> for yourself , ” replied he .
“ The <unk> is <unk> . ” “ I think that if you would take the trouble of <unk> , you could find a way of <unk> the <unk> , ” said Franz .
“ How so ? ” returned the count , with surprise .
“ If we were to go together to Luigi Vampa , I am sure he would not refuse you Albert ’ s freedom . ” “ What influence can I possibly have over a bandit ? ” “ Have you not just rendered him a service that can never be forgotten ? ” “ What is that ? ” “ Have you not saved Peppino ’ s life ? ” “ Well , well , ” said the count , “ who told you that ? ” “ No matter ; I know it . ” The count <unk> his <unk> , and remained silent an instant .
“ And if I went to seek Vampa , would you accompany me ? ” “ If my society would not be disagreeable . ” “ Be it so .
It is a lovely night , and a walk without Rome will do us both good . ” “ Shall I take any arms ? ” “ For what purpose ? ” “ Any money ? ” “ It is useless .
Where is the man who brought the letter ? ” “ In the street . ” “ He <unk> the answer ? ” “ Yes . ” “ I must learn where we are going .
I will summon him hither . ” “ It is useless ; he would not come up . ” “ To your apartments , perhaps ; but he will not make any difficulty at entering mine . ” The count went to the window of the apartment that looked on to the street , and <unk> in a peculiar manner .
The man in the mantle quitted the wall , and advanced into the middle of the street .
“ _ <unk> ! _ ” said the count , in the same tone in which he would have given an order to his servant .
The messenger obeyed without the least hesitation , but rather with <unk> , and , <unk> the steps at a bound , entered the hotel ; five seconds afterwards he was at the door of the room .
“ Ah , it is you , Peppino , ” said the count .
But Peppino , instead of answering , threw himself on his knees , seized the count ’ s hand , and covered it with <unk> .
“ Ah , ” said the count , “ you have , then , not forgotten that I saved your life ; that is strange , for it is a week ago . ” <unk> “ No , excellency ; and never shall I forget it , ” returned Peppino , with an accent of profound gratitude .
“ Never ?
That is a long time ; but it is something that you believe so .
<unk> and answer . ” Peppino glanced anxiously at Franz .
“ Oh , you may speak before his excellency , ” said he ; “ he is one of my friends .
You allow me to give you this title ? ” continued the count in French , “ it is necessary to excite this man ’ s confidence . ” “ You can speak before me , ” said Franz ; “ I am a friend of the count ’ s . ” “ Good ! ” returned Peppino .
“ I am ready to answer any questions your excellency may address to me . ” “ How did the <unk> Albert fall into Luigi ’ s hands ? ” “ <unk> , the Frenchman ’ s carriage passed several times the one in which was Teresa . ” “ The chief ’ s mistress ? ” “ Yes .
The Frenchman threw her a <unk> ; Teresa returned it — all this with the consent of the chief , who was in the carriage . ” “ What ? ” cried Franz , “ was Luigi Vampa in the carriage with the Roman peasants ? ” “ It was he who drove , <unk> as the coachman , ” replied Peppino .
“ Well ? ” said the count .
“ Well , then , the Frenchman took off his mask ; Teresa , with the chief ’ s consent , did the same .
The Frenchman asked for a <unk> ; Teresa gave him one — only , instead of Teresa , it was <unk> who was on the steps of the church of <unk> <unk> . ” “ What ! ” exclaimed Franz , “ the peasant girl who <unk> his _ <unk> _ from him — — ” “ Was a lad of fifteen , ” replied Peppino .
“ But it was no disgrace to your friend to have been deceived ; <unk> has taken in plenty of others . ” “ And <unk> led him outside the walls ? ” said the count .
“ Exactly so ; a carriage was waiting at the end of the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> got in , <unk> the Frenchman to follow him , and he did not wait to be asked twice .
He <unk> offered the <unk> seat to <unk> , and sat by him .
<unk> told him he was going to take him to a <unk> a league from Rome ; the Frenchman assured him he would follow him to the end of the world .
The coachman went up the <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> ; and when they were two hundred <unk> outside , as the Frenchman became somewhat too forward , <unk> put a <unk> of pistols to his head , the coachman pulled up and did the same .
At the same time , four of the band , who were concealed on the banks of the <unk> , surrounded the carriage .
The Frenchman made some resistance , and nearly <unk> <unk> ; but he could not resist five armed men , and was forced to yield .
They made him get out , walk along the banks of the river , and then brought him to Teresa and Luigi , who were waiting for him in the <unk> of St. <unk> . ” “ Well , ” said the count , turning towards Franz , “ it seems to me that this is a very likely story .
What do you say to it ? ” “ Why , that I should think it very amusing , ” replied Franz , “ if it had happened to anyone but poor Albert . ” “ And , in truth , if you had not found me here , ” said the count , “ it might have proved a gallant adventure which would have cost your friend dear ; but now , be assured , his alarm will be the only serious consequence . ” “ And shall we go and find him ? ” inquired Franz .
“ Oh , decidedly , sir .
He is in a very picturesque place — do you know the <unk> of St. <unk> ? ” “ I was never in them ; but I have often resolved to visit them . ” “ Well , here is an opportunity made to your hand , and it would be difficult to <unk> a better .
Have you a carriage ? ” “ No . ” “ That is of no consequence ; I always have one ready , day and night . ” “ <unk> ready ? ” “ Yes .
I am a very <unk> being , and I should tell you that sometimes when I rise , or after my dinner , or in the middle of the night , I resolve on starting for some particular point , and away I go . ” The count rang , and a <unk> appeared .
“ <unk> out the carriage , ” he said , “ and remove the pistols which are in the <unk> .
You need not <unk> the coachman ; Ali will drive . ” In a very short time the noise of wheels was heard , and the carriage stopped at the door .
The count took out his watch .
“ <unk> twelve , ” he said .
“ We might start at five o ’ clock and be in time , but the delay may cause your friend to pass an uneasy night , and therefore we had better go with all speed to <unk> him from the hands of the <unk> .
Are you still resolved to accompany me ? ” “ More determined than ever . ” “ Well , then , come along . ” Franz and the count went downstairs , accompanied by Peppino .
At the door they found the carriage .
Ali was on the box , in whom Franz recognized the <unk> slave of the grotto of Monte Cristo .
Franz and the count got into the carriage .
Peppino placed himself beside Ali , and they set off at a rapid pace .
Ali had received his instructions , and went down the <unk> , crossed the <unk> <unk> , went up the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and reached the gates of St. <unk> .
Then the porter raised some difficulties , but the Count of Monte Cristo produced a permit from the governor of Rome , allowing him to leave or enter the city at any hour of the day or night ; the <unk> was therefore raised , the porter had a louis for his trouble , and they went on their way .
The road which the carriage now traversed was the ancient <unk> <unk> , and bordered with <unk> .
From time to time , by the light of the moon , which began to rise , Franz imagined that he saw something like a sentinel appear at various points among the ruins , and suddenly retreat into the darkness on a signal from Peppino .
A short time before they reached the <unk> of <unk> the carriage stopped , Peppino opened the door , and the count and Franz <unk> .
“ In ten minutes , ” said the count to his companion , “ we shall be there . ” He then took Peppino aside , gave him an order in a low voice , and Peppino went away , taking with him a torch , brought with them in the carriage .
Five minutes elapsed , during which Franz saw the shepherd going along a narrow path that led over the <unk> and broken surface of the <unk> ; and finally he disappeared in the midst of the tall red <unk> , which seemed like the bristling <unk> of an enormous lion .
“ Now , ” said the count , “ let us follow him . ” Franz and the count in their turn then advanced along the same path , which , at the distance of a hundred paces , led them over a <unk> to the bottom of a small valley .
They then perceived two men conversing in the obscurity .
“ <unk> we to go on ? ” asked Franz of the count ; “ or should we pause ? ” “ Let us go on ; Peppino will have warned the <unk> of our coming . ” One of the two men was Peppino , and the other a bandit on the <unk> .
Franz and the count advanced , and the bandit <unk> them .
“ Your excellency , ” said Peppino , addressing the count , “ if you will follow me , the opening of the <unk> is close at hand . ” “ Go on , then , ” replied the count .
They came to an opening behind a <unk> of <unk> and in the midst of a pile of rocks , by which a man could scarcely pass .
Peppino <unk> first into this <unk> ; after they got along a few paces the passage <unk> .
Peppino passed , lighted his torch , and turned to see if they came after him .
The count first reached an open space and Franz followed him closely .
The <unk> <unk> in a gentle descent , <unk> as they proceeded ; still Franz and the count were compelled to advance in a <unk> <unk> , and were scarcely able to proceed <unk> of one another .
They went on a hundred and fifty paces in this way , and then were stopped by , “ Who comes there ? ” At the same time they saw the reflection of a torch on a <unk> <unk> .
“ A friend ! ” responded Peppino ; and , advancing alone towards the <unk> , he said a few words to him in a low tone ; and then he , like the first , <unk> the nocturnal visitors , making a sign that they might proceed .
Behind the sentinel was a staircase with twenty steps .
Franz and the count descended these , and found themselves in a <unk> chamber .
Five <unk> <unk> like the rays of a star , and the walls , dug into <unk> , which were arranged one above the other in the shape of <unk> , showed that they were at last in the <unk> .
<unk> one of the <unk> , whose extent it was impossible to determine , rays of light were visible .
The count laid his hand on Franz ’ s shoulder .
“ Would you like to see a <unk> of bandits in repose ? ” he inquired .
“ <unk> , ” replied Franz .
“ Come with me , then .
Peppino , put out the torch . ” Peppino obeyed , and Franz and the count were in utter darkness , except that fifty paces in advance of them a <unk> <unk> , more evident since Peppino had put out his torch , was visible along the wall .
They advanced silently , the count <unk> Franz as if he had the singular <unk> of seeing in the dark .
Franz himself , however , saw his way more plainly in proportion as he went on towards the light , which served in some manner as a guide .
Three <unk> were before them , and the middle one was used as a door .
These <unk> opened on one side into the corridor where the count and Franz were , and on the other into a large square chamber , entirely surrounded by <unk> similar to those of which we have spoken .
In the midst of this chamber were four stones , which had formerly served as an altar , as was evident from the cross which still surmounted them .
A lamp , placed at the base of a <unk> , lighted up with its pale and <unk> flame the singular scene which presented itself to the eyes of the two visitors concealed in the shadow .
A man was seated with his elbow leaning on the column , and was reading with his back turned to the <unk> , through the <unk> of which the <unk> contemplated him .
This was the chief of the band , Luigi Vampa .
<unk> him , and in groups , according to their fancy , lying in their <unk> , or with their <unk> against a sort of stone bench , which went all round the <unk> , were to be seen twenty <unk> or more , each having his <unk> within reach .
At the other end , silent , scarcely visible , and like a shadow , was a sentinel , who was walking up and down before a grotto , which was only <unk> because in that spot the darkness seemed more <unk> than elsewhere .
When the count thought Franz had gazed sufficiently on this picturesque <unk> , he raised his finger to his lips , to warn him to be silent , and , <unk> the three steps which led to the corridor of the <unk> , entered the chamber by the middle <unk> , and advanced towards Vampa , who was so <unk> on the book before him that he did not hear the noise of his footsteps .
“ Who comes there ? ” cried the sentinel , who was less <unk> , and who saw by the <unk> a shadow approaching his chief .
At this <unk> , Vampa rose quickly , drawing at the same moment a pistol from his <unk> .
In a moment all the bandits were on their feet , and twenty <unk> were <unk> at the count .
“ Well , ” said he in a voice perfectly calm , and no <unk> of his countenance disturbed , “ well , my dear Vampa , it appears to me that you receive a friend with a great deal of ceremony . ” <unk> “ <unk> arms , ” exclaimed the chief , with an <unk> sign of the hand , while with the other he took off his hat <unk> ; then , turning to the singular personage who had caused this scene , he said , “ Your pardon , your excellency , but I was so far from expecting the honor of a visit , that I did not really recognize you . ” “ It seems that your memory is equally short in everything , Vampa , ” said the count , “ and that not only do you forget people ’ s faces , but also the conditions you make with them . ” “ What conditions have I forgotten , your excellency ? ” inquired the bandit , with the air of a man who , having committed an error , is anxious to <unk> it .
“ Was it not agreed , ” asked the count , “ that not only my person , but also that of my friends , should be respected by you ? ” “ And how have I broken that <unk> , your excellency ? ” “ You have this evening carried off and conveyed hither the <unk> Albert de Morcerf .
Well , ” continued the count , in a tone that made Franz shudder , “ this young gentleman is one of _ my friends _ — this young gentleman <unk> in the same hotel as myself — this young gentleman has been up and down the <unk> for eight hours in my private carriage , and yet , I repeat to you , you have carried him off , and conveyed him hither , and , ” added the count , taking the letter from his pocket , “ you have set a <unk> on him , as if he were an utter stranger . ” “ Why did you not tell me all this — you ? ” inquired the <unk> chief , turning towards his men , who all retreated before his look .
“ Why have you caused me thus to fail in my word towards a gentleman like the count , who has all our lives in his hands ?
By heavens !
if I thought one of you knew that the young gentleman was the friend of his excellency , I would blow his brains out with my own hand ! ” <unk> “ Well , ” said the count , turning towards Franz , “ I told you there was some mistake in this . ” “ Are you not alone ? ” asked Vampa with uneasiness .
“ I am with the person to whom this letter was addressed , and to whom I desired to prove that Luigi Vampa was a man of his word .
Come , your excellency , ” the count added , turning to Franz , “ here is Luigi Vampa , who will himself express to you his deep regret at the mistake he has committed . ” Franz approached , the chief advancing several steps to meet him .
“ <unk> among us , your excellency , ” he said to him ; “ you heard what the count just said , and also my reply ; let me add that I would not for the four thousand piastres at which I had fixed your friend ’ s <unk> , that this had happened . ” “ But , ” said Franz , looking round him <unk> , “ where is the viscount ? — I do not see him . ” “ Nothing has happened to him , I hope , ” said the count <unk> .
“ The prisoner is there , ” replied Vampa , pointing to the hollow space in front of which the bandit was on guard , “ and I will go myself and tell him he is free . ” The chief went towards the place he had pointed out as Albert ’ s prison , and Franz and the count followed him .
“ What is the prisoner doing ? ” inquired Vampa of the sentinel .
“ _ Ma foi _ , captain , ” replied the <unk> , “ I do not know ; for the last hour I have not heard him stir . ” “ Come in , your excellency , ” said Vampa .
The count and Franz ascended seven or eight steps after the chief , who drew back a bolt and opened a door .
Then , by the gleam of a lamp , similar to that which lighted the <unk> , Albert was to be seen wrapped up in a cloak which one of the bandits had lent him , lying in a corner in profound slumber .
“ Come , ” said the count , smiling with his own peculiar smile , “ not so bad for a man who is to be shot at seven o ’ clock tomorrow morning . ” Vampa looked at Albert with a kind of admiration ; he was not <unk> to such a proof of courage .
“ You are right , your excellency , ” he said ; “ this must be one of your friends . ” Then going to Albert , he touched him on the shoulder , saying , “ Will your excellency please to <unk> ? ” Albert stretched out his arms , <unk> his eyelids , and opened his eyes .
“ Oh , ” said he , “ is it you , captain ?
You should have allowed me to sleep .
I had such a delightful dream .
I was dancing the <unk> at <unk> ’ s with the <unk> G — — . ” Then he drew his watch from his pocket , that he might see how time <unk> .
“ <unk> one only ? ” said he .
“ Why the devil do you <unk> me at this hour ? ” “ To tell you that you are free , your excellency . ” “ My dear fellow , ” replied Albert , with perfect ease of mind , “ remember , for the future , Napoleon ’ s <unk> , ‘ Never <unk> me but for bad news ; ’ if you had let me sleep on , I should have finished my <unk> , and have been grateful to you all my life .
So , then , they have paid my <unk> ? ” “ No , your excellency . ” “ Well , then , how am I free ? ” “ A person to whom I can refuse nothing has come to demand you . ” “ Come hither ? ” “ Yes , hither . ” “ Really ?
Then that person is a most amiable person . ” Albert looked around and perceived Franz .
“ What , ” said he , “ is it you , my dear Franz , whose devotion and friendship are thus displayed ? ” “ No , not I , ” replied Franz , “ but our neighbor , the Count of Monte Cristo . ” “ Oh , my dear count , ” said Albert <unk> , arranging his cravat and <unk> , “ you are really most kind , and I hope you will consider me as under eternal <unk> to you , in the first place for the carriage , and in the next for this visit , ” and he put out his hand to the count , who shuddered as he gave his own , but who nevertheless did give it .
The bandit gazed on this scene with amazement ; he was evidently accustomed to see his prisoners tremble before him , and yet here was one whose gay <unk> was not for a moment altered ; as for Franz , he was <unk> at the way in which Albert had sustained the <unk> honor in the presence of the bandit .
“ My dear Albert , ” he said , “ if you will make haste , we shall yet have time to finish the night at <unk> ’ s .
You may <unk> your interrupted <unk> , so that you will owe no <unk> to Signor Luigi , who has , indeed , throughout this whole affair acted like a gentleman . ” “ You are decidedly right , and we may reach the <unk> by two o ’ clock .
Signor Luigi , ” continued Albert , “ is there any <unk> to fulfil before I take leave of your excellency ? ” “ None , sir , ” replied the bandit , “ you are as free as air . ” “ Well , then , a happy and merry life to you .
Come , gentlemen , come . ” And Albert , followed by Franz and the count , descended the staircase , crossed the square chamber , where stood all the bandits , hat in hand .
“ Peppino , ” said the <unk> chief , “ give me the torch . ” “ What are you going to do ? ” inquired the count .
“ I will show you the way back myself , ” said the captain ; “ that is the least honor that I can render to your excellency . ” And taking the lighted torch from the hands of the <unk> , he preceded his guests , not as a servant who <unk> an act of civility , but like a king who <unk> <unk> .
On reaching the door , he bowed .
“ And now , your excellency , ” added he , “ allow me to repeat my <unk> , and I hope you will not entertain any resentment at what has occurred . ” “ No , my dear Vampa , ” replied the count ; “ besides , you <unk> for your <unk> in so <unk> a way , that one almost feels obliged to you for having committed them . ” <unk> “ Gentlemen , ” added the chief , turning towards the young men , “ perhaps the offer may not appear very <unk> to you ; but if you should ever feel inclined to pay me a second visit , wherever I may be , you shall be welcome . ” Franz and Albert bowed .
The count went out first , then Albert .
Franz paused for a moment .
“ Has your excellency anything to ask me ? ” said Vampa with a smile .
“ Yes , I have , ” replied Franz ; “ I am curious to know what work you were <unk> with so much attention as we entered . ” “ Cæsar ’ s _ <unk> _ , ” said the bandit , “ it is my favorite work . ” “ Well , are you coming ? ” asked Albert .
“ Yes , ” replied Franz , “ here I am , ” and he , in his turn , left the <unk> .
They advanced to the plain .
“ Ah , your pardon , ” said Albert , turning round ; “ will you allow me , captain ? ” And he lighted his <unk> at Vampa ’ s torch .
“ Now , my dear count , ” he said , “ let us on with all the speed we may .
I am <unk> anxious to finish my night at the <unk> of <unk> ’ s . ” They found the carriage where they had left it .
The count said a word in <unk> to Ali , and the horses went on at great speed .
It was just two o ’ clock by Albert ’ s watch when the two friends entered into the <unk> .
Their return was quite an event , but as they entered together , all uneasiness on Albert ’ s account ceased instantly .
“ Madame , ” said the <unk> of Morcerf , advancing towards the countess , “ yesterday you were so <unk> as to promise me a <unk> ; I am rather late in <unk> this gracious promise , but here is my friend , whose character for <unk> you well know , and he will assure you the delay arose from no fault of mine . ” And as at this moment the <unk> gave the signal for the <unk> , Albert put his arm round the waist of the countess , and disappeared with her in the <unk> of <unk> .
In the meanwhile Franz was considering the singular shudder that had passed over the Count of Monte Cristo at the moment when he had been , in some sort , forced to give his hand to Albert .
Chapter <unk> .
The <unk> The first words that Albert uttered to his friend , on the following morning , contained a request that Franz would accompany him on a visit to the count ; true , the young man had warmly and <unk> thanked the count on the previous evening ; but services such as he had rendered could never be too often acknowledged .
Franz , who seemed attracted by some invisible influence towards the count , in which terror was strangely mingled , felt an extreme <unk> to permit his friend to be exposed alone to the singular <unk> that this mysterious personage seemed to exercise over him , and therefore made no objection to Albert ’ s request , but at once accompanied him to the desired spot , and , after a short delay , the count joined them in the salon .
“ My dear count , ” said Albert , advancing to meet him , “ permit me to repeat the poor thanks I offered last night , and to assure you that the remembrance of all I owe to you will never be <unk> from my memory ; believe me , as long as I live , I shall never cease to dwell with grateful recollection on the <unk> and important service you rendered me ; and also to remember that to you I am indebted even for my life . ” “ My very good friend and excellent neighbor , ” replied the count , with a smile , “ you really <unk> my trifling <unk> .
You owe me nothing but some trifle of <unk> francs , which you have been saved out of your travelling expenses , so that there is not much of a <unk> between us ; — but you must really permit me to congratulate you on the ease and <unk> with which you resigned yourself to your fate , and the perfect indifference you manifested as to the turn events might take . ” “ Upon my word , ” said Albert , “ I deserve no credit for what I could not help , <unk> , a determination to take everything as I found it , and to let those bandits see , that although men get into troublesome <unk> all over the world , there is no nation but the French that can smile even in the face of grim Death himself .
All that , however , has nothing to do with my <unk> to you , and I now come to ask you whether , in my own person , my family , or <unk> , I can in any way serve you ?
My father , the Comte de Morcerf , although of Spanish origin , possesses considerable influence , both at the court of France and <unk> , and I <unk> place the best services of myself , and all to whom my life is dear , at your disposal . ” “ Monsieur de Morcerf , ” replied the count , “ your offer , far from surprising me , is precisely what I expected from you , and I accept it in the same spirit of <unk> sincerity with which it is made ; — nay , I will go still further , and say that I had previously made up my mind to ask a great favor at your hands . ” “ Oh , pray name it . ” “ I am wholly a stranger to Paris — it is a city I have never yet seen . ” “ Is it possible , ” exclaimed Albert , “ that you have reached your present age without visiting the <unk> capital in the world ?
I can scarcely credit it . ” “ Nevertheless , it is quite true ; still , I agree with you in thinking that my present ignorance of the first city in Europe is a reproach to me in every way , and calls for immediate <unk> ; but , in all probability , I should have performed so important , so necessary a duty , as that of making myself acquainted with the <unk> and <unk> of your <unk> celebrated capital , had I known any person who would have introduced me into the fashionable world , but unfortunately I possessed no acquaintance there , and , of necessity , was compelled to abandon the idea . ” “ So distinguished an individual as yourself , ” cried Albert , “ could scarcely have required an introduction . ” “ You are most kind ; but as <unk> myself , I can find no merit I possess , save that , as a <unk> , I might have become a partner in the <unk> of M. <unk> and M. <unk> ; but as my motive in travelling to your capital would not have been for the pleasure of <unk> in <unk> , I <unk> away till some favorable chance should present itself of carrying my wish into execution .
Your offer , however , <unk> all difficulties , and I have only to ask you , my dear M. de Morcerf ” ( these words were accompanied by a most peculiar smile ) , “ whether you <unk> , upon my arrival in France , to open to me the doors of that fashionable world of which I know no more than a <unk> or a native of <unk> ? ” “ Oh , that I do , and with infinite pleasure , ” answered Albert ; “ and so much the more readily as a letter received this morning from my father <unk> me to Paris , in consequence of a <unk> of marriage ( my dear Franz , do not smile , I beg of you ) with a family of high standing , and connected with the very <unk> of Parisian society . ” “ <unk> by marriage , you mean , ” said Franz , <unk> .
“ Well , never mind how it is , ” answered Albert , “ it comes to the same thing in the end .
Perhaps by the time you return to Paris , I shall be quite a <unk> , <unk> father of a family !
A most <unk> <unk> I shall make of all the domestic virtues — don ’ t you think so ?
But as <unk> your wish to visit our fine city , my dear count , I can only say that you may command me and mine to any extent you please . ” “ Then it is settled , ” said the count , “ and I give you my solemn assurance that I only waited an opportunity like the present to realize plans that I have long meditated . ” Franz did not doubt that these plans were the same concerning which the count had dropped a few words in the grotto of Monte Cristo , and while the count was speaking the young man watched him closely , hoping to read something of his purpose in his face , but his countenance was <unk> especially when , as in the present case , it was veiled in a <unk> smile .
“ But tell me now , count , ” exclaimed Albert , delighted at the idea of having to <unk> so distinguished a person as Monte Cristo ; “ tell me truly whether you are in earnest , or if this project of visiting Paris is merely one of the <unk> and <unk> air <unk> of which we make so many in the course of our lives , but which , like a house built on the sand , is <unk> to be <unk> over by the first <unk> of wind ? ” “ I <unk> you my honor , ” returned the count , “ that I mean to do as I have said ; both inclination and <unk> necessity <unk> me to visit Paris . ” “ When do you propose going thither ? ” “ Have you made up your mind when you shall be there yourself ? ” “ Certainly I have ; in a fortnight or three weeks ’ time , that is to say , as fast as I can get there ! ” “ Nay , ” said the Count ; “ I will give you three months ere I join you ; you see I make an <unk> <unk> for all <unk> and difficulties .
“ And in three months ’ time , ” said Albert , “ you will be at my house ? ” “ Shall we make a <unk> <unk> for a particular day and hour ? ” inquired the count ; “ only let me warn you that I am <unk> for my <unk> <unk> in keeping my engagements . ” “ <unk> for day , hour for hour , ” said Albert ; “ that will suit me to a <unk> . ” “ So be it , then , ” replied the count , and extending his hand towards a <unk> , suspended near the chimney-piece , he said , “ today is the <unk> of February ; ” and drawing out his watch , added , “ it is exactly half-past ten o ’ clock .
Now promise me to remember this , and expect me the <unk> of May at the same hour in the <unk> . ” “ <unk> ! ” exclaimed Albert ; “ your breakfast shall be waiting . ” “ Where do you live ? ” “ No .
<unk> , Rue du <unk> . ” “ Have you <unk> ’ s apartments there ?
I hope my coming will not put you to any inconvenience . ” “ I <unk> in my father ’ s house , but occupy a <unk> at the farther side of the courtyard , entirely separated from the main building . ” “ Quite sufficient , ” replied the count , as , taking out his <unk> , he wrote down “ No .
<unk> , Rue du <unk> , <unk> May , half-past ten in the morning . ” “ Now then , ” said the count , returning his <unk> to his pocket , “ make yourself perfectly easy ; the hand of your <unk> will not be more <unk> in <unk> the time than myself . ” “ Shall I see you again ere my departure ? ” asked Albert .
“ That depends ; when do you leave ? ” “ <unk> evening , at five o ’ clock . ” “ In that case I must say adieu to you , as I am compelled to go to Naples , and shall not return hither before Saturday evening or Sunday morning .
And you , baron , ” pursued the count , addressing Franz , “ do you also depart tomorrow ? ” “ Yes . ” “ For France ? ” “ No , for <unk> ; I shall remain in Italy for another year or two . ” “ Then we shall not meet in Paris ? ” “ I fear I shall not have that honor . ” “ Well , since we must part , ” said the count , holding out a hand to each of the young men , “ allow me to wish you both a safe and pleasant journey . ” It was the first time the hand of Franz had come in contact with that of the mysterious individual before him , and unconsciously he shuddered at its touch , for it felt cold and <unk> as that of a corpse .
<unk> “ Let us understand each other , ” said Albert ; “ it is agreed — is it not ? — that you are to be at No .
<unk> , in the Rue du <unk> , on the <unk> of May , at half-past ten in the morning , and your word of honor passed for your <unk> ? ” “ The <unk> of May , at half-past ten in the morning , Rue du <unk> , No .
<unk> , ” replied the count .
The young men then rose , and bowing to the count , quitted the room .
“ What is the matter ? ” asked Albert of Franz , when they had returned to their own apartments ; “ you seem more than <unk> thoughtful . ” “ I will confess to you , Albert , ” replied Franz , “ the count is a very singular person , and the <unk> you have made to meet him in Paris <unk> me with a thousand <unk> . ” “ My dear fellow , ” exclaimed Albert , “ what can there possibly be in that to excite uneasiness ?
Why , you must have lost your senses . ” “ Whether I am in my senses or not , ” answered Franz , “ that is the way I feel . ” “ Listen to me , Franz , ” said Albert ; “ I am glad that the occasion has presented itself for saying this to you , for I have noticed how cold you are in your bearing towards the count , while he , on the other hand , has always been <unk> itself to us .
Have you anything particular against him ? ” “ <unk> . ” “ Did you ever meet him previously to coming hither ? ” “ I have . ” “ And where ? ” “ Will you promise me not to repeat a single word of what I am about to tell you ? ” “ I promise . ” “ Upon your honor ? ” “ Upon my honor . ” “ Then listen to me . ” Franz then related to his friend the history of his <unk> to the Island of Monte Cristo and of his finding a party of smugglers there , and the two Corsican bandits with them .
He dwelt with considerable force and energy on the almost <unk> hospitality he had received from the count , and the <unk> of his <unk> in the grotto of the _ <unk> and One <unk> _ .
He <unk> , with <unk> <unk> , all the particulars of the supper , the <unk> , the <unk> , the dream , and how , at his <unk> , there remained no proof or trace of all these events , save the small yacht , seen in the distant horizon driving under full sail toward <unk> .
Then he <unk> the conversation <unk> by him at the Colosseum , between the count and Vampa , in which the count had promised to obtain the <unk> of the bandit Peppino , — an engagement which , as our <unk> are aware , he most <unk> <unk> .
At last he arrived at the adventure of the preceding night , and the embarrassment in which he found himself placed by not having sufficient <unk> by six or seven hundred piastres to make up the sum required , and finally of his application to the count and the picturesque and <unk> result that followed .
Albert listened with the most profound attention .
“ Well , ” said he , when Franz had concluded , “ what do you find to object to in all you have related ?
The count is fond of travelling , and , being rich , possesses a vessel of his own .
Go but to <unk> or <unk> , and you will find the <unk> <unk> with the <unk> belonging to such of the English as can afford the expense , and have the same <unk> for this amusement .
Now , by way of having a <unk> during his <unk> , <unk> the wretched <unk> — which has been trying its best to poison me during the last four months , while you have <unk> <unk> its effects for as many years , — and obtaining a bed on which it is possible to slumber , Monte Cristo has furnished for himself a <unk> abode where you first found him ; but , to prevent the possibility of the <unk> government taking a fancy to his <unk> palace , and <unk> <unk> him of the advantages naturally expected from so large an <unk> of capital , he has <unk> enough purchased the island , and taken its name .
Just ask yourself , my good fellow , whether there are not many persons of our acquaintance who assume the names of <unk> and <unk> they never in their lives were masters of ? ” “ But , ” said Franz , “ the Corsican bandits that were among the crew of his vessel ? ” “ Why , really the thing seems to me simple enough .
Nobody knows better than yourself that the bandits of Corsica are not <unk> or thieves , but <unk> and simply <unk> , driven by some sinister motive from their native town or village , and that their <unk> <unk> no disgrace or <unk> ; for my own part , I protest that , should I ever go to Corsica , my first visit , ere even I presented myself to the mayor or prefect , should be to the bandits of <unk> , if I could only manage to find them ; for , on my conscience , they are a race of men I admire greatly . ” “ Still , ” <unk> Franz , “ I suppose you will allow that such men as Vampa and his band are regular <unk> , who have no other motive than <unk> when they seize your person .
How do you explain the influence the count evidently possessed over those ruffians ? ” “ My good friend , as in all probability I own my present safety to that influence , it would ill become me to search too closely into its source ; therefore , instead of <unk> him for his intimacy with <unk> , you must give me leave to excuse any little <unk> there may be in such a connection ; not altogether for <unk> my life , for my own idea was that it never was in much danger , but certainly for <unk> me <unk> piastres , which , being <unk> , means neither more nor less than <unk> livres of our money — a sum at which , most assuredly , I should never have been <unk> in France , <unk> most <unk> , ” added Albert with a laugh , “ that no <unk> is <unk> in his own country . ” “ <unk> of countries , ” replied Franz , “ of what country is the count , what is his native tongue , whence does he <unk> his immense fortune , and what were those events of his early life — a life as marvellous as unknown — that have <unk> his <unk> years with so dark and gloomy a <unk> ?
Certainly these are questions that , in your place , I should like to have answered . ” “ My dear Franz , ” replied Albert , “ when , upon receipt of my letter , you found the necessity of asking the count ’ s assistance , you <unk> went to him , saying , ‘ My friend Albert de Morcerf is in danger ; help me to deliver him . ’ Was not that nearly what you said ? ” <unk> “ It was . ” “ Well , then , did he ask you , ‘ Who is M. Albert de Morcerf ?
how does he come by his name — his fortune ?
what are his means of existence ?
what is his <unk> ?
of what country is he a native ? ’ Tell me , did he put all these questions to you ? ” “ I confess he asked me none . ” “ No ; he merely came and <unk> me from the hands of Signor Vampa , where , I can assure you , in spite of all my <unk> appearance of ease and <unk> , I did not very particularly care to remain .
Now , then , Franz , when , for services so <unk> and <unk> rendered , he but <unk> me in return to do for him what is done daily for any <unk> prince or Italian <unk> who may pass through Paris — merely to introduce him into society — would you have me refuse ?
My good fellow , you must have lost your senses to think it possible I could act with such <unk> <unk> . ” And this time it must be confessed that , contrary to the usual state of affairs in <unk> between the young men , the <unk> <unk> were all on Albert ’ s side .
“ Well , ” said Franz with a sigh , “ do as you please my dear viscount , for your <unk> are beyond my powers of <unk> .
Still , in spite of all , you must admit that this Count of Monte Cristo is a most singular personage . ” “ He is a <unk> , ” answered the other ; “ and no doubt his motive in visiting Paris is to <unk> for the <unk> <unk> , given , as you are aware , to <unk> shall be proved to have most <unk> advanced the interests of virtue and humanity .
If my <unk> and interest can obtain it for him , I will readily give him the one and promise the other .
And now , my dear Franz , let us talk of something else .
Come , shall we take our <unk> , and then pay a last visit to St. <unk> ’ s ? ” Franz silently <unk> ; and the following afternoon , at half-past five o ’ clock , the young men parted .
Albert de Morcerf to return to Paris , and Franz d ’ Épinay to pass a fortnight at <unk> .
But , ere he entered his travelling carriage , Albert , fearing that his expected guest might forget the engagement he had entered into , placed in the care of a waiter at the hotel a card to be delivered to the Count of Monte Cristo , on which , beneath the name of <unk> Albert de Morcerf , he had written in <unk> : “ <unk> , _ Rue du <unk> , on the _ <unk> _ <unk> May , half-past ten _ <unk> ” Chapter <unk> .
The <unk> In the house in the Rue du <unk> , where Albert had invited the Count of Monte Cristo , everything was being prepared on the morning of the <unk> of May to do honor to the occasion .
Albert de Morcerf inhabited a <unk> situated at the corner of a large court , and directly opposite another building , in which were the servants ’ apartments .
Two windows only of the <unk> <unk> the street ; three other windows looked into the court , and two at the back into the garden .
Between the court and the garden , built in the heavy style of the <unk> <unk> , was the large and fashionable dwelling of the Count and <unk> of Morcerf .
A high wall surrounded the whole of the property , surmounted at intervals by <unk> filled with flowers , and broken in the centre by a large gate of gilded iron , which served as the carriage entrance .
A small door , close to the lodge of the _ concierge _ , gave <unk> and <unk> to the servants and masters when they were on foot .
It was easy to discover that the delicate care of a mother , unwilling to part from her son , and yet aware that a young man of the viscount ’ s age required the full exercise of his liberty , had chosen this <unk> for Albert .
There were not lacking , however , <unk> of what we may call the intelligent <unk> of a youth who is <unk> with the <unk> , <unk> life of an only son , and who lives as it were in a gilded <unk> .
By means of the two windows looking into the street , Albert could see all that passed ; the sight of what is going on is necessary to young men , who always want to see the world traverse their horizon , even if that horizon is only a public <unk> .
Then , should anything appear to merit a more minute examination , Albert de Morcerf could follow up his <unk> by means of a small gate , similar to that close to the _ concierge ’ s _ door , and which <unk> a particular description .
It was a little entrance that seemed never to have been opened since the house was built , so entirely was it covered with dust and <unk> ; but the <unk> hinges and locks told quite another story .
This door was a <unk> to the _ concierge _ , from whose <unk> and <unk> it was free , and , like that famous <unk> in the _ Arabian <unk> _ , opening at the “ _ <unk> _ ” of Ali <unk> , it was <unk> to <unk> <unk> at a <unk> word or a <unk> <unk> from without from the <unk> voices or <unk> fingers in the world .
At the end of a long corridor , with which the door communicated , and which formed the antechamber , was , on the right , Albert ’ s <unk> , looking into the court , and on the left the salon , looking into the garden .
<unk> and <unk> plants covered the windows , and hid from the garden and court these two apartments , the only rooms into which , as they were on the ground floor , the <unk> eyes of the curious could penetrate .
On the floor above were similar rooms , with the addition of a third , formed out of the antechamber ; these three rooms were a salon , a <unk> , and a bedroom .
The salon downstairs was only an <unk> <unk> , for the use of <unk> .
The <unk> upstairs communicated with the <unk> by an invisible door on the staircase ; it was evident that every precaution had been taken .
<unk> this floor was a large _ <unk> _ , which had been increased in size by <unk> down the <unk> — a <unk> , in which the artist and the <unk> strove for <unk> .
There were collected and <unk> up all Albert ’ s <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> — a whole <unk> , for Albert had had not a taste but a fancy for music ; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> — for music had been succeeded by <unk> ; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> — for , following the example of the fashionable young men of the time , Albert de Morcerf <unk> , with far more <unk> than music and drawing , the three <unk> that complete a <unk> ’ s education , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> ; and it was here that he received <unk> , <unk> , and Charles <unk> .
The rest of the furniture of this <unk> apartment consisted of old <unk> , filled with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> _ <unk> _ , and <unk> <unk> ; of old <unk> , in which perhaps had sat Henry <unk> .
or <unk> , Louis <unk> .
or <unk> — for two of these <unk> , <unk> with a <unk> <unk> , on which were <unk> the <unk> of France on an azure field , evidently came from the <unk> , or , at least , some royal residence .
<unk> these dark and sombre chairs were thrown splendid <unk> , <unk> beneath <unk> ’ s sun , or <unk> by the fingers of the women of <unk> or of <unk> .
What these <unk> did there , it was impossible to say ; they awaited , while <unk> the eyes , a <unk> unknown to their owner himself ; in the meantime they filled the place with their golden and <unk> reflections .
In the centre of the room was a <unk> and <unk> “ <unk> grand ” <unk> in <unk> , but holding the <unk> of an <unk> in its narrow and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> beneath the weight of the _ <unk> ’ <unk> _ of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
On the walls , over the doors , on the ceiling , were swords , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ; gilded , <unk> , and <unk> <unk> of <unk> ; dried plants , <unk> , and <unk> birds , their <unk> wings <unk> in motionless flight , and their <unk> forever open .
This was Albert ’ s favorite <unk> place .
However , the morning of the <unk> , the young man had established himself in the small salon downstairs .
There , on a table , surrounded at some distance by a large and <unk> <unk> , every species of <unk> known , — from the yellow <unk> of <unk> to the black of <unk> , and so on along the scale from <unk> and <unk> <unk> , to <unk> , — was exposed in <unk> of <unk> <unk> of which the <unk> are so fond ; beside them , in boxes of <unk> wood , were <unk> , according to their size and quality , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> ; and , in an open cabinet , a collection of German <unk> , of <unk> , with their <unk> <unk> ornamented with <unk> , and of <unk> , with their long <unk> of <unk> , awaiting the <unk> or the sympathy of the <unk> .
Albert had himself <unk> at the arrangement , or , rather , the <unk> <unk> , which , after coffee , the guests at a breakfast of modern days love to <unk> through the <unk> that <unk> from their mouths , and <unk> in long and <unk> <unk> to the ceiling .
At a quarter to ten , a valet entered ; he composed , with a little <unk> named John , and who only spoke English , all Albert ’ s establishment , although the <unk> of the hotel was always at his service , and on great occasions the count ’ s _ <unk> _ also .
This valet , whose name was <unk> , and who enjoyed the entire confidence of his young master , held in one hand a number of papers , and in the other a packet of letters , which he gave to Albert .
Albert glanced <unk> at the different <unk> , selected two written in a small and delicate hand , and <unk> in <unk> <unk> , opened them and <unk> their contents with some attention .
“ How did these letters come ? ” said he .
“ One by the post , Madame Danglars ’ <unk> left the other . ” “ Let Madame Danglars know that I accept the place she offers me in her box .
Wait ; then , during the day , tell <unk> that when I leave the Opera I will <unk> with her as she wishes .
Take her six bottles of different wine — <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , and a <unk> of <unk> <unk> ; get them at <unk> ’ s , and be sure you say they are for me . ” “ At what o ’ clock , sir , do you breakfast ? ” <unk> “ What time is it now ? ” “ A quarter to ten . ” “ Very well , at half past ten .
Debray will , perhaps , be obliged to go to the minister — and besides ” ( Albert looked at his <unk> ) , “ it is the hour I told the count , <unk> May , at half past ten ; and though I do not much rely upon his promise , I wish to be <unk> .
Is the countess up yet ? ” “ If you wish , I will inquire . ” “ Yes , ask her for one of her _ <unk> _ <unk> , mine is incomplete ; and tell her I shall have the honor of seeing her about three o ’ clock , and that I request permission to introduce someone to her . ” The valet left the room .
Albert threw himself on the <unk> , tore off the cover of two or three of the papers , looked at the theatre <unk> , made a face seeing they gave an <unk> , and not a <unk> ; hunted <unk> amongst the <unk> for a new <unk> of which he had heard , and threw down , one after the other , the three leading papers of Paris , <unk> , “ These papers become more and more stupid every day . ” A moment after , a carriage stopped before the door , and the servant announced M. Lucien Debray .
A tall young man , with light hair , clear gray eyes , and thin and <unk> lips , dressed in a blue coat with <unk> <unk> gold <unk> , a white <unk> , and a <unk> <unk> suspended by a <unk> thread , and which , by an effort of the <unk> and <unk> <unk> , he fixed in his eye , entered , with a <unk> air , without smiling or speaking .
“ <unk> , Lucien , <unk> , ” said Albert ; “ your <unk> really <unk> me .
What do I say ?
<unk> !
You , whom I expected last , you arrive at five minutes to ten , when the time fixed was half-past !
Has the <unk> resigned ? ” “ No , my dear fellow , ” returned the young man , <unk> himself on the <unk> ; “ <unk> yourself ; we are <unk> always , but we never fall , and I begin to believe that we shall pass into a state of <unk> , and then the affairs of the <unk> will completely <unk> us . ” “ Ah , true ; you drive Don <unk> out of Spain . ” “ No , no , my dear fellow , do not <unk> our plans .
We take him to the other side of the French <unk> , and offer him hospitality at <unk> . ” “ At <unk> ? ” “ Yes , he has not much to complain of ; <unk> is the capital of Charles <unk> .
Do you not know that all Paris knew it yesterday , and the day before it had already <unk> on the <unk> , and M. Danglars ( I do not know by what means that man <unk> to obtain intelligence as soon as we do ) made a million ! ” “ And you another order , for I see you have a blue ribbon at your <unk> . ” “ Yes ; they sent me the order of Charles <unk> . , ” returned Debray <unk> .
“ Come , do not affect indifference , but confess you were pleased to have it . ” “ Oh , it is very well as a finish to the toilet .
It looks very <unk> on a black coat <unk> up . ” “ And makes you resemble the Prince of <unk> or the <unk> of <unk> . ” “ It is for that reason you see me so early . ” “ Because you have the order of Charles <unk> . , and you wish to announce the good news to me ? ” “ No , because I passed the night writing letters , — <unk> <unk> .
I returned home at daybreak , and strove to sleep ; but my head <unk> and I got up to have a ride for an hour .
At the <unk> de <unk> , _ <unk> _ and hunger attacked me at once , — two enemies who rarely accompany each other , and who are yet <unk> against me , a sort of <unk> alliance .
I then recollected you gave a breakfast this morning , and here I am .
I am hungry , <unk> me ; I am <unk> , amuse me . ” “ It is my duty as your host , ” returned Albert , <unk> the bell , while Lucien turned over , with his <unk> cane , the papers that lay on the table .
“ <unk> , a glass of <unk> and a <unk> .
In the meantime , my dear Lucien , here are <unk> — <unk> , of course — try them , and persuade the minister to sell us such instead of <unk> us with <unk> leaves . ” “ _ <unk> ! _ I will do nothing of the kind ; the moment they come from government you would find them <unk> .
Besides , that does not concern the home but the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> yourself to M. <unk> , <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , corridor <unk> , No .
<unk> . ” “ On my word , ” said Albert , “ you <unk> me by the extent of your knowledge .
Take a <unk> . ” “ Really , my dear Albert , ” replied Lucien , <unk> a <unk> at a <unk> <unk> that burnt in a <unk> <unk> stand — “ how happy you are to have nothing to do .
You do not know your own good fortune ! ” “ And what would you do , my dear <unk> , ” replied Morcerf , with a slight degree of <unk> in his voice , “ if you did nothing ?
What ?
private secretary to a minister , plunged at once into <unk> <unk> and Parisian <unk> ; having kings , and , better still , <unk> , to protect , parties to <unk> , <unk> to direct ; making more use of your cabinet with your pen and your telegraph than Napoleon did of his <unk> with his sword and his <unk> ; <unk> <unk> thousand francs a year , besides your place ; a horse , for which Château-Renaud offered you four hundred louis , and which you would not part with ; a <unk> who never <unk> you ; with the <unk> , the <unk> , and other <unk> , can you not amuse yourself ?
Well , I will amuse you . ” “ How ? ” “ By <unk> to you a new acquaintance . ” “ A man or a woman ? ” “ A man . ” “ I know so many men already . ” “ But you do not know this man . ” “ Where does he come from — the end of the world ? ” “ <unk> still , perhaps . ” “ The deuce !
I hope he does not bring our breakfast with him . ” “ Oh , no ; our breakfast comes from my father ’ s kitchen .
Are you hungry ? ” “ <unk> as such a confession is , I am .
But I dined at M. de Villefort ’ s , and <unk> always give you very bad <unk> .
You would think they felt some remorse ; did you ever remark that ? ” “ Ah , <unk> other persons ’ <unk> ; you <unk> give such splendid ones . ” “ Yes ; but we do not invite people of fashion .
If we were not forced to entertain a <unk> of country <unk> because they think and <unk> with us , we should never dream of <unk> at home , I assure you . ” “ Well , take another glass of <unk> and another <unk> . ” “ <unk> .
Your Spanish wine is excellent .
You see we were quite right to <unk> that country . ” “ Yes ; but Don <unk> ? ” “ Well , Don <unk> will drink <unk> , and in ten years we will marry his son to the little <unk> . ” “ You will then obtain the <unk> <unk> , if you are still in the <unk> . ” “ I think , Albert , you have adopted the system of <unk> me on smoke this morning . ” “ Well , you must allow it is the best thing for the stomach ; but I hear Beauchamp in the next room ; you can <unk> together , and that will pass away the time . ” “ About what ? ” “ About the papers . ” “ My dear friend , ” said Lucien with an air of sovereign contempt , “ do I ever read the papers ? ” “ Then you will <unk> the more . ” “ M.
Beauchamp , ” announced the servant .
“ Come in , come in , ” said Albert , rising and advancing to meet the young man .
“ Here is Debray , who <unk> you without reading you , so he says . ” “ He is quite right , ” returned Beauchamp ; “ for I <unk> him without knowing what he does .
<unk> , <unk> ! ” “ Ah , you know that already , ” said the private secretary , smiling and shaking hands with him .
“ _ <unk> ! _ ” “ And what do they say of it in the world ? ” “ In which world ?
we have so many <unk> in the year of grace <unk> . ” “ In the entire political world , of which you are one of the <unk> . ” “ They say that it is quite fair , and that <unk> so much red , you ought to <unk> a little blue . ” “ Come , come , that is not bad ! ” said Lucien .
“ Why do you not join our party , my dear Beauchamp ?
With your talents you would make your fortune in three or four years . ” “ I only await one thing before following your advice ; that is , a minister who will hold office for six months .
My dear Albert , one word , for I must give poor Lucien a <unk> .
Do we breakfast or dine ?
I must go to the Chamber , for our life is not an idle one . ” “ You only breakfast ; I await two persons , and the instant they arrive we shall sit down to table . ” Chapter <unk> .
The <unk> And what sort of persons do you expect to breakfast ? ” said Beauchamp .
“ A gentleman , and a <unk> . ” “ Then we shall have to wait two hours for the gentleman , and three for the <unk> .
I shall come back to <unk> ; keep me some <unk> , coffee , and <unk> .
I shall take a <unk> on my way to the Chamber . ” “ Do not do anything of the sort ; for were the gentleman a <unk> , and the <unk> a <unk> , we will breakfast at eleven ; in the meantime , follow Debray ’ s example , and take a glass of <unk> and a <unk> . ” “ Be it so ; I will stay ; I must do something to <unk> my thoughts . ” “ You are like Debray , and yet it seems to me that when the minister is out of spirits , the opposition ought to be joyous . ” “ Ah , you do not know with what I am threatened .
I shall hear this morning that M. Danglars make a speech at the Chamber of <unk> , and at his wife ’ s this evening I shall hear the tragedy of a <unk> of France .
The devil take the <unk> government , and since we had our choice , as they say , at least , how could we choose that ? ” “ I understand ; you must lay in a stock of <unk> . ” “ Do not run down M. Danglars ’ <unk> , ” said Debray ; “ he <unk> for you , for he belongs to the opposition . ” “ _ <unk> _ , that is exactly the worst of all .
I am waiting until you send him to speak at the Luxembourg , to laugh at my ease . ” “ My dear friend , ” said Albert to Beauchamp , “ it is plain that the affairs of Spain are settled , for you are most <unk> out of <unk> this morning .
<unk> that Parisian <unk> has spoken of a marriage between myself and <unk>
Eugénie Danglars ; I cannot in conscience , therefore , let you run down the <unk> of a man who will one day say to me , ‘ <unk> , you know I give my daughter two millions . ’ ” “ Ah , this marriage will never take place , ” said Beauchamp .
“ The king has made him a baron , and can make him a <unk> , but he cannot make him a gentleman , and the Count of Morcerf is too <unk> to consent , for the <unk> sum of two million francs , to a _ <unk> _ .
The <unk> of Morcerf can only <unk> a <unk> . ” “ But two million francs make a nice little sum , ” replied Morcerf .
“ It is the social capital of a theatre on the boulevard , or a <unk> from the <unk> des <unk> to La <unk> . ” “ Never mind what he says , Morcerf , ” said Debray , “ do you marry her .
You marry a <unk> <unk> , it is true ; well , but what does that matter ?
It is better to have a <unk> less and a figure more on it .
You have seven <unk> on your arms ; give three to your wife , and you will still have four ; that is one more than M. de <unk> had , who so nearly became King of France , and whose cousin was Emperor of <unk> . ” “ On my word , I think you are right , Lucien , ” said Albert <unk> .
“ To be sure ; besides , every <unk> is as noble as a <unk> — that is , he can be . ” “ Do not say that , Debray , ” returned Beauchamp , laughing , “ for here is Château-Renaud , who , to cure you of your <unk> for <unk> , will pass the sword of <unk> de <unk> , his <unk> , through your body . ” “ He will <unk> it then , ” returned Lucien ; “ for I am low — very low . ” “ Oh , heavens , ” cried Beauchamp , “ the minister <unk> <unk> , what shall we come to next ? ” “ M.
de Château-Renaud — M.
Maximilian Morrel , ” said the servant , <unk> two fresh guests .
“ Now , then , to breakfast , ” said Beauchamp ; “ for , if I remember , you told me you only expected two persons , Albert . ” “ Morrel , ” muttered Albert — “ Morrel — who is he ? ” But before he had finished , M. de Château-Renaud , a handsome young man of thirty , gentleman all over , — that is , with the figure of a <unk> and the wit of a <unk> , — took Albert ’ s hand .
“ My dear Albert , ” said he , “ let me introduce to you M. Maximilian Morrel , captain of <unk> , my friend ; and what is more — however the man speaks for himself — my <unk> .
<unk> my hero , viscount . ” And he stepped on one side to give place to a young man of <unk> and <unk> bearing , with large and open brow , piercing eyes , and black <unk> , whom our <unk> have already seen at Marseilles , under circumstances sufficiently <unk> not to be forgotten .
A rich uniform , half French , half <unk> , set off his graceful and <unk> figure , and his broad chest was <unk> with the order of the Legion of Honor .
The young officer bowed with easy and elegant politeness .
“ Monsieur , ” said Albert with affectionate <unk> , “ the count of Château-Renaud knew how much pleasure this introduction would give me ; you are his friend , be ours also . ” “ Well said , ” interrupted Château-Renaud ; “ and pray that , if you should ever be in a similar <unk> , he may do as much for you as he did for me . ” “ What has he done ? ” asked Albert .
“ Oh , nothing worth speaking of , ” said Morrel ; “ M.
de Château-Renaud <unk> . ” “ Not worth speaking of ? ” cried Château-Renaud ; “ life is not worth speaking of ! — that is rather too <unk> , on my word , Morrel .
It is very well for you , who risk your life every day , but for me , who only did so once — — ” “ We <unk> from all this , baron , that Captain Morrel saved your life . ” “ Exactly so . ” “ On what occasion ? ” asked Beauchamp .
“ Beauchamp , my good fellow , you know I am <unk> , ” said Debray : “ do not set him off on some long story . ” “ Well , I do not prevent your sitting down to table , ” replied Beauchamp , “ Château-Renaud can tell us while we eat our breakfast . ” “ Gentlemen , ” said Morcerf , “ it is only a quarter past ten , and I expect someone else . ” “ Ah , true , a <unk> ! ” observed Debray .
“ <unk> or not , I don ’ t know ; I only know that he charged himself on my account with a mission , which he <unk> so entirely to my satisfaction , that had I been king , I should have instantly created him <unk> of all my orders , even had I been able to offer him the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> . ” “ Well , since we are not to sit down to table , ” said Debray , “ take a glass of <unk> , and tell us all about it . ” “ You all know that I had the fancy of going to <unk> . ” “ It is a road your <unk> have traced for you , ” said Albert <unk> .
“ Yes ?
but I doubt that your object was like <unk> — to <unk> the Holy <unk> . ” “ You are quite right , Beauchamp , ” observed the young <unk> .
“ It was only to fight as an <unk> .
I cannot bear <unk> ever since two seconds , whom I had chosen to arrange an affair , forced me to break the arm of one of my best friends , one whom you all know — poor Franz d ’ Épinay . ” “ Ah , true , ” said Debray , “ you did fight some time ago ; about what ? ” <unk> “ The devil take me , if I remember , ” returned Château-Renaud .
“ But I recollect perfectly one thing , that , being unwilling to let such talents as mine sleep , I wished to try upon the <unk> the new pistols that had been given to me .
In consequence I <unk> for <unk> , and went from thence to <unk> , where I arrived just in time to witness the raising of the <unk> .
I retreated with the rest , for <unk> hours .
I endured the rain during the day , and the cold during the night tolerably well , but the third morning my horse died of cold .
Poor brute — accustomed to be covered up and to have a stove in the <unk> , the Arabian finds himself unable to bear ten degrees of cold in <unk> . ” “ That ’ s why you want to purchase my English horse , ” said Debray , “ you think he will bear the cold better . ” “ You are mistaken , for I have made a <unk> never to return to <unk> . ” “ You were very much frightened , then ? ” asked Beauchamp .
“ Well , yes , and I had good reason to be so , ” replied Château-Renaud .
“ I was retreating on foot , for my horse was dead .
Six <unk> came up , full <unk> , to cut off my head .
I shot two with my <unk> gun , and two more with my pistols , but I was then <unk> , and two were still left ; one seized me by the hair ( that is why I now wear it so short , for no one knows what may happen ) , the other <unk> a <unk> , and I already felt the cold steel on my neck , when this gentleman whom you see here charged them , shot the one who held me by the hair , and <unk> the <unk> of the other with his <unk> .
He had <unk> himself the task of <unk> a man ’ s life that day ; chance caused that man to be myself .
When I am rich I will order a statue of <unk> from <unk> or <unk> . ” “ Yes , ” said Morrel , smiling , “ it was the 5th of September , the <unk> of the day on which my father was <unk> preserved ; therefore , as far as it lies in my power , I endeavor to <unk> it by some — — ” <unk> “ <unk> action , ” interrupted Château-Renaud .
“ I was chosen .
But that is not all — after <unk> me from the sword , he <unk> me from the cold , not by <unk> his cloak with me , like St. Martin , but by giving me the whole ; then from hunger by <unk> with me — guess what ? ” “ A <unk> <unk> ? ” asked Beauchamp .
“ No , his horse ; of which we each of us ate a <unk> with a <unk> appetite .
It was very hard . ” “ The horse ? ” said Morcerf , laughing .
“ No , the sacrifice , ” returned Château-Renaud ; “ ask Debray if he would sacrifice his English <unk> for a stranger ? ” “ Not for a stranger , ” said Debray , “ but for a friend I might , perhaps . ” “ I divined that you would become mine , count , ” replied Morrel ; “ besides , as I had the honor to tell you , <unk> or not , sacrifice or not , that day I owed an offering to bad fortune in recompense for the <unk> good fortune had on other days granted to us . ” “ The history to which M. Morrel <unk> , ” continued Château-Renaud , “ is an admirable one , which he will tell you some day when you are better acquainted with him ; today let us fill our <unk> , and not our memories .
What time do you breakfast , Albert ? ” “ At half-past ten . ” “ <unk> ? ” asked Debray , taking out his watch .
“ Oh , you will give me five minutes ’ grace , ” replied Morcerf , “ for I also expect a <unk> . ” “ Of whom ? ” “ Of myself , ” cried Morcerf ; “ _ <unk> ! _ do you think I cannot be saved as well as anyone else , and that there are only <unk> who cut off heads ?
Our breakfast is a <unk> one , and we shall have at table — at least , I hope so — two <unk> of humanity . ” “ What shall we do ? ” said Debray ; “ we have only one <unk> <unk> . ” “ Well , it will be given to someone who has done nothing to deserve it , ” said Beauchamp ; “ that is the way the <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> . ” “ And where does he come from ? ” asked Debray .
“ You have already answered the question once , but so vaguely that I venture to put it a second time . ” “ Really , ” said Albert , “ I do not know ; when I invited him three months ago , he was then at Rome , but since that time who knows where he may have gone ? ” “ And you think him capable of being exact ? ” demanded Debray .
“ I think him capable of everything . ” “ Well , with the five minutes ’ grace , we have only ten left . ” “ I will profit by them to tell you something about my guest . ” “ I beg pardon , ” interrupted Beauchamp ; “ are there any <unk> for an article in what you are going to tell us ? ” “ Yes , and for a most curious one . ” “ Go on , then , for I see I shall not get to the Chamber this morning , and I must make up for it . ” “ I was at Rome during the last Carnival . ” “ We know that , ” said Beauchamp .
“ Yes , but what you do not know is that I was carried off by bandits . ” “ There are no bandits , ” cried Debray .
“ Yes there are , and most hideous , or rather most admirable ones , for I found them ugly enough to <unk> me . ” “ Come , my dear Albert , ” said Debray , “ confess that your <unk> is <unk> , that the <unk> have not arrived from <unk> or <unk> , and that , like Madame de <unk> , you are going to replace the <unk> by a story .
Say so at once ; we are sufficiently <unk> to excuse you , and to listen to your history , <unk> as it promises to be . ” “ And I say to you , <unk> as it may seem , I tell it as a true one from beginning to end .
The <unk> had carried me off , and conducted me to a gloomy spot , called the <unk> of Saint <unk> . ” “ I know it , ” said Château-Renaud ; “ I <unk> escaped catching a fever there . ” “ And I did more than that , ” replied Morcerf , “ for I caught one .
I was informed that I was prisoner until I paid the sum of <unk> Roman crowns — about <unk> francs .
<unk> , I had not above <unk> .
I was at the end of my journey and of my credit .
I wrote to Franz — and were he here he would <unk> every word — I wrote then to Franz that if he did not come with the four thousand crowns before six , at ten minutes past I should have gone to join the blessed <unk> and <unk> <unk> in whose company I had the honor of being ; and Signor Luigi Vampa , such was the name of the chief of these bandits , would have <unk> kept his word . ” “ But Franz did come with the four thousand crowns , ” said Château-Renaud .
“ A man whose name is Franz d ’ Épinay or Albert de Morcerf has not much difficulty in <unk> them . ” “ No , he arrived accompanied simply by the guest I am going to present to you . ” “ Ah , this gentleman is a <unk> <unk> <unk> , a <unk> <unk> <unk> . ” “ No , he is a man about my own size . ” “ <unk> to the teeth ? ” “ He had not even a <unk> . ” “ But he paid your <unk> ? ” “ He said two words to the chief and I was free . ” “ And they <unk> to him for having carried you off ? ” said Beauchamp .
“ Just so . ” “ Why , he is a second <unk> . ” “ No , his name is the Count of Monte Cristo . ” “ There is no Count of Monte Cristo ” said Debray .
“ I do not think so , ” added Château-Renaud , with the air of a man who knows the whole of the <unk> nobility perfectly .
“ Does anyone know anything of a Count of Monte Cristo ? ” “ He comes possibly from the Holy <unk> , and one of his <unk> possessed <unk> , as the <unk> did the <unk> <unk> . ” “ I think I can assist your <unk> , ” said Maximilian .
“ Monte Cristo is a little island I have often heard spoken of by the old sailors my father employed — a <unk> of sand in the centre of the <unk> , an <unk> in the infinite . ” “ <unk> ! ” cried Albert .
“ Well , he of whom I speak is the lord and master of this <unk> of sand , of this <unk> ; he has purchased the title of count somewhere in <unk> . ” “ He is rich , then ? ” “ I believe so . ” “ But that ought to be visible . ” “ That is what <unk> you , Debray . ” “ I do not understand you . ” “ Have you read the _ Arabian <unk> _ ? ” “ What a question ! ” “ Well , do you know if the persons you see there are rich or poor , if their <unk> of <unk> are not <unk> or diamonds ?
They seem like poor <unk> , and suddenly they open some mysterious cavern filled with the wealth of the <unk> . ” “ Which means ? ” “ Which means that my Count of Monte Cristo is one of those <unk> .
He has even a name taken from the book , since he calls himself Sinbad the <unk> , and has a <unk> filled with gold . ” “ And you have seen this cavern , Morcerf ? ” asked Beauchamp .
“ No , but Franz has ; for heaven ’ s sake , not a word of this before him .
Franz went in with his eyes <unk> , and was waited on by <unk> and by women to whom <unk> was a painted <unk> .
Only he is not quite sure about the women , for they did not come in until after he had taken <unk> , so that what he took for women might have been simply a <unk> of <unk> . ” The two young men looked at Morcerf as if to say , — “ Are you mad , or are you laughing at us ? ” “ And I also , ” said Morrel <unk> , “ have heard something like this from an old sailor named Penelon . ” “ Ah , ” cried Albert , “ it is very lucky that M. Morrel comes to aid me ; you are vexed , are you not , that he thus gives a <unk> to the <unk> ? ” “ My dear Albert , ” said Debray , “ what you tell us is so extraordinary . ” “ Ah , because your <unk> and your <unk> do not tell you of them — they have no time .
They are too much taken up with <unk> in the affairs of their <unk> who travel . ” “ Now you get angry , and attack our poor agents .
How will you have them protect you ?
The Chamber <unk> down their <unk> every day , so that now they have scarcely any .
Will you be <unk> , Albert ?
I will send you to <unk> . ” “ No , lest on the first <unk> I make in favor of <unk> Ali , the <unk> send me the <unk> , and make my <unk> <unk> me . ” “ You say very true , ” responded Debray .
“ Yes , ” said Albert , “ but this has nothing to do with the existence of the Count of Monte Cristo . ” “ _ <unk> ! _ everyone exists . ” “ <unk> , but not in the same way ; everyone has not black <unk> , a <unk> <unk> , an <unk> of weapons that would do credit to an Arabian <unk> , horses that cost six thousand francs <unk> , and Greek <unk> . ” “ Have you seen the Greek mistress ? ” “ I have both seen and heard her .
I saw her at the theatre , and heard her one morning when I <unk> with the count . ” “ He <unk> , then ? ” “ Yes ; but so little , it can hardly be called eating . ” “ He must be a <unk> . ” “ <unk> , if you will ; the <unk> G — — , who knew Lord <unk> , declared that the count was a <unk> . ” “ Ah , capital , ” said Beauchamp .
“ For a man not connected with newspapers , here is the <unk> to the famous <unk> of the _ <unk> _ . ” “ <unk> eyes , the <unk> of which <unk> or <unk> at pleasure , ” said Debray ; “ <unk> angle strongly <unk> , magnificent forehead , livid complexion , black beard , sharp and white teeth , politeness <unk> . ” “ Just so , Lucien , ” returned Morcerf ; “ you have described him <unk> for <unk> .
Yes , <unk> and cutting politeness .
This man has often made me shudder ; and one day when we were <unk> an execution , I thought I should faint , more from hearing the cold and calm manner in which he spoke of every description of torture , than from the sight of the executioner and the <unk> . ” “ Did he not conduct you to the ruins of the Colosseum and <unk> your blood ? ” asked Beauchamp .
“ Or , having delivered you , make you sign a <unk> <unk> , <unk> your soul to him as <unk> did his <unk> ? ” “ <unk> on , <unk> on at your ease , gentlemen , ” said Morcerf , somewhat <unk> .
“ When I look at you <unk> , <unk> on the Boulevard de <unk> or the <unk> de <unk> , and think of this man , it seems to me we are not of the same race . ” “ I am highly flattered , ” returned Beauchamp .
“ At the same time , ” added Château-Renaud , “ your Count of Monte Cristo is a very fine fellow , always excepting his little arrangements with the Italian <unk> . ” “ There are no Italian <unk> , ” said Debray .
“ No <unk> , ” cried Beauchamp .
“ No Count of Monte Cristo ” added Debray .
“ There is half-past ten striking , Albert . ” <unk> “ <unk> you have dreamed this , and let us sit down to breakfast , ” continued Beauchamp .
But the sound of the clock had not died away when <unk> announced , “ His excellency the Count of Monte Cristo . ” The <unk> start everyone gave proved how much Morcerf ’ s <unk> had impressed them , and Albert himself could not wholly refrain from <unk> sudden emotion .
He had not heard a carriage stop in the street , or steps in the antechamber ; the door had itself opened <unk> .
The count appeared , dressed with the greatest simplicity , but the most <unk> <unk> could have found nothing to <unk> at in his toilet .
Every article of dress — hat , coat , gloves , and boots — was from the first <unk> .
He seemed scarcely <unk> .
But what struck everybody was his extreme resemblance to the portrait Debray had drawn .
The count advanced , smiling , into the centre of the room , and approached Albert , who hastened towards him holding out his hand in a <unk> manner .
“ <unk> , ” said Monte Cristo , “ is the politeness of kings , according to one of your <unk> , I think ; but it is not the same with travellers .
However , I hope you will excuse the two or three seconds I am <unk> ; five hundred leagues are not to be accomplished without some trouble , and especially in France , where , it seems , it is forbidden to beat the <unk> . ” “ My dear count , ” replied Albert , “ I was <unk> your visit to some of my friends , whom I had invited in consequence of the promise you did me the honor to make , and whom I now present to you .
They are the Count of Château-Renaud , whose nobility goes back to the twelve <unk> , and whose <unk> had a place at the <unk> <unk> ; M. Lucien Debray , private secretary to the minister of the interior ; M. Beauchamp , an <unk> of a paper , and the terror of the French government , but of whom , in spite of his <unk> <unk> , you perhaps have not heard in Italy , since his paper is <unk> there ; and M. Maximilian Morrel , captain of <unk> . ” At this name the count , who had hitherto <unk> everyone with <unk> , but at the same time with <unk> and <unk> , stepped a pace forward , and a slight <unk> of red <unk> his pale cheeks .
“ You wear the uniform of the new French <unk> , monsieur , ” said he ; “ it is a handsome uniform . ” No one could have said what caused the count ’ s voice to <unk> so deeply , and what made his eye flash , which was in general so clear , <unk> , and <unk> when he pleased .
“ You have never seen our <unk> , count ? ” said Albert .
“ Never , ” replied the count , who was by this time perfectly master of himself again .
“ Well , beneath this uniform <unk> one of the <unk> and <unk> hearts in the whole army . ” “ Oh , M. de Morcerf , ” interrupted Morrel .
“ Let me go on , captain .
And we have just heard , ” continued Albert , “ of a new deed of his , and so heroic a one , that , although I have seen him today for the first time , I request you to allow me to introduce him as my friend . ” At these words it was still possible to observe in Monte Cristo the <unk> look , changing color , and slight trembling of the <unk> that show emotion .
“ Ah , you have a noble heart , ” said the count ; “ so much the better . ” This exclamation , which <unk> to the count ’ s own thought rather than to what Albert was saying , surprised everybody , and especially Morrel , who looked at Monte Cristo with wonder .
But , at the same time , the <unk> was so soft that , however strange the speech might seem , it was impossible to be offended at it .
<unk> “ Why should he doubt it ? ” said Beauchamp to Château-Renaud .
“ In reality , ” replied the latter , who , with his <unk> glance and his knowledge of the world , had penetrated at once all that was <unk> in Monte Cristo , “ Albert has not deceived us , for the count is a most singular being .
What say you , Morrel ! ” “ _ Ma foi _ , he has an open look about him that pleases me , in spite of the singular remark he has made about me . ” “ Gentlemen , ” said Albert , “ <unk> <unk> me that breakfast is ready .
My dear count , allow me to show you the way . ” They passed silently into the <unk> , and everyone took his place .
“ Gentlemen , ” said the count , <unk> himself , “ permit me to make a confession which must form my excuse for any <unk> I may commit .
I am a stranger , and a stranger to such a degree , that this is the first time I have ever been at Paris .
The French way of living is utterly unknown to me , and up to the present time I have followed the <unk> customs , which are entirely in contrast to the Parisian .
I beg you , therefore , to excuse if you find anything in me too <unk> , too Italian , or too Arabian .
Now , then , let us breakfast . ” “ With what an air he says all this , ” muttered Beauchamp ; “ decidedly he is a great man . ” “ A great man in his own country , ” added Debray .
“ A great man in every country , M. Debray , ” said Château-Renaud .
The count was , it may be remembered , a most <unk> guest .
Albert remarked this , expressing his fears lest , at the <unk> , the Parisian mode of life should <unk> the traveller in the most <unk> point .
“ My dear count , ” said he , “ I fear one thing , and that is , that the <unk> of the Rue du <unk> is not so much to your taste as that of the Piazza <unk> <unk> .
I ought to have consulted you on the point , and have had some <unk> prepared <unk> . ” “ Did you know me better , ” returned the count , smiling , “ you would not give one thought of such a thing for a traveller like myself , who has <unk> lived on <unk> at Naples , <unk> at <unk> , <unk> <unk> at <unk> , <unk> at <unk> , <unk> in <unk> , and <unk> ’ <unk> in <unk> .
I eat everywhere , and of everything , only I eat but little ; and today , that you reproach me with my want of appetite , is my day of appetite , for I have not eaten since yesterday morning . ” “ What , ” cried all the guests , “ you have not eaten for <unk> hours ? ” “ No , ” replied the count ; “ I was forced to go out of my road to obtain some information near <unk> , so that I was somewhat late , and therefore I did not choose to stop . ” “ And you ate in your carriage ? ” asked Morcerf .
“ No , I slept , as I generally do when I am weary without having the courage to amuse myself , or when I am hungry without feeling inclined to eat . ” “ But you can sleep when you please , monsieur ? ” said Morrel .
“ Yes . ” “ You have a <unk> for it ? ” “ An <unk> one . ” “ That would be <unk> to us in <unk> , who have not always any food to eat , and rarely anything to drink . ” “ Yes , ” said Monte Cristo ; “ but , unfortunately , a <unk> excellent for a man like myself would be very dangerous applied to an army , which might not awake when it was needed . ” “ May we inquire what is this <unk> ? ” asked Debray .
“ Oh , yes , ” returned Monte Cristo ; “ I make no secret of it .
It is a mixture of excellent <unk> , which I <unk> myself from <unk> in order to have it pure , and the best <unk> which grows in the East — that is , between the <unk> and the <unk> .
These two <unk> are mixed in equal <unk> , and formed into <unk> .
Ten minutes after one is taken , the effect is produced .
<unk> Baron Franz d ’ Épinay ; I think he <unk> them one day . ” “ Yes , ” replied Morcerf , “ he said something about it to me . ” “ But , ” said Beauchamp , who , as became a <unk> , was very <unk> , “ you always carry this <unk> about you ? ” “ <unk> . ” “ Would it be an <unk> to ask to see those precious <unk> ? ” continued Beauchamp , hoping to take him at a <unk> .
“ No , monsieur , ” returned the count ; and he drew from his pocket a marvellous <unk> , formed out of a single <unk> and closed by a golden <unk> which <unk> and gave passage to a small <unk> <unk> <unk> about the size of a <unk> .
This ball had an <unk> and penetrating odor .
There were four or five more in the <unk> , which would contain about a dozen .
The <unk> passed around the table , but it was more to examine the admirable <unk> than to see the <unk> that it passed from hand to hand .
“ And is it your <unk> who <unk> these <unk> ? ” asked Beauchamp .
“ Oh , no , monsieur , ” replied Monte Cristo ; “ I do not thus betray my <unk> to the vulgar .
I am a tolerable <unk> , and prepare my <unk> myself . ” “ This is a magnificent <unk> , and the <unk> I have ever seen , ” said Château-Renaud , “ although my mother has some remarkable family jewels . ” “ I had three similar ones , ” returned Monte Cristo .
“ I gave one to the <unk> , who mounted it in his <unk> ; another to our holy father the <unk> , who had it set in his <unk> , opposite to one nearly as large , though not so fine , given by the Emperor Napoleon to his <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
I kept the third for myself , and I had it <unk> out , which reduced its value , but rendered it more <unk> for the purpose I intended . ” <unk> looked at Monte Cristo with astonishment ; he spoke with so much simplicity that it was evident he spoke the truth , or that he was mad .
However , the sight of the <unk> made them naturally <unk> to the former belief .
“ And what did these two <unk> give you in exchange for these magnificent presents ? ” asked Debray .
“ The <unk> , the liberty of a woman , ” replied the Count ; “ the <unk> , the life of a man ; so that once in my life I have been as powerful as if heaven had brought me into the world on the steps of a throne . ” “ And it was Peppino you saved , was it not ? ” cried Morcerf ; “ it was for him that you obtained pardon ? ” “ Perhaps , ” returned the count , smiling .
“ My dear count , you have no idea what pleasure it gives me to hear you speak thus , ” said Morcerf .
“ I had announced you beforehand to my friends as an <unk> of the _ Arabian <unk> _ , a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> ; but the <unk> are so <unk> in <unk> that they mistake for <unk> of the imagination the most <unk> <unk> , when these <unk> do not form a part of their daily existence .
For example , here is Debray who <unk> , and Beauchamp who <unk> , every day , ‘ A member of the <unk> <unk> has been stopped and robbed on the Boulevard ; ’ ‘ four persons have been assassinated in the Rue St. <unk> ’ or ‘ the Faubourg St. <unk> ; ’ ‘ ten , fifteen , or twenty thieves , have been arrested in a _ <unk> _ on the Boulevard du Temple , or in the <unk> de <unk> , ’ — and yet these same men deny the existence of the bandits in the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> <unk> .
Tell them yourself that I was taken by bandits , and that without your generous <unk> I should now have been sleeping in the <unk> of St. <unk> , instead of receiving them in my humble abode in the Rue du <unk> . ” “ Ah , ” said Monte Cristo “ you promised me never to mention that circumstance . ” “ It was not I who made that promise , ” cried Morcerf ; “ it must have been someone else whom you have <unk> in the same manner , and whom you have forgotten .
Pray speak of it , for I shall not only , I trust , relate the little I do know , but also a great deal I do not know . ” “ It seems to me , ” returned the count , smiling , “ that you played a sufficiently important part to know as well as myself what happened . ” <unk> “ Well , you promise me , if I tell all I know , to relate , in your turn , all that I do not know ? ” “ That is but fair , ” replied Monte Cristo .
“ Well , ” said Morcerf , “ for three days I believed myself the object of the attentions of a <unk> , whom I took for a <unk> of <unk> or <unk> , while I was simply the object of the attentions of a _ <unk> _ , and I say _ <unk> _ to avoid saying peasant girl .
What I know is , that , like a fool , a greater fool than he of whom I spoke just now , I <unk> for this peasant girl a young bandit of fifteen or sixteen , with a <unk> chin and <unk> waist , and who , just as I was about to <unk> a <unk> salute on his lips , placed a pistol to my head , and , <unk> by seven or eight others , led , or rather dragged me , to the <unk> of St. <unk> , where I found a highly <unk> <unk> chief <unk> Cæsar ’ s _ <unk> _ , and who <unk> to leave off reading to inform me , that unless the next morning , before six o ’ clock , four thousand piastres were paid into his account at his banker ’ s , at a quarter past six I should have ceased to exist .
The letter is still to be seen , for it is in Franz d ’ Épinay ’ s possession , signed by me , and with a <unk> of M. Luigi Vampa .
This is all I know , but I know not , count , how you contrived to inspire so much respect in the bandits of Rome who <unk> have so little respect for anything .
I assure you , Franz and I were lost in admiration . ” “ Nothing more simple , ” returned the count .
“ I had known the famous Vampa for more than ten years .
When he was quite a child , and only a shepherd , I gave him a few gold pieces for showing me my way , and he , in order to <unk> me , gave me a <unk> , the <unk> of which he had <unk> with his own hand , and which you may have seen in my collection of arms .
In after years , whether he had forgotten this <unk> of presents , which ought to have <unk> our friendship , or whether he did not recollect me , he sought to take me , but , on the contrary , it was I who captured him and a dozen of his band .
I might have handed him over to Roman justice , which is somewhat <unk> , and which would have been particularly so with him ; but I did nothing of the sort — I suffered him and his band to depart . ” “ With the condition that they should sin no more , ” said Beauchamp , laughing .
“ I see they kept their promise . ” “ No , monsieur , ” returned Monte Cristo “ upon the simple condition that they should respect myself and my friends .
Perhaps what I am about to say may seem strange to you , who are <unk> , and <unk> humanity and your duty to your neighbor , but I never seek to protect a society which does not protect me , and which I will even say , generally <unk> itself about me only to <unk> me ; and thus by giving them a low place in my esteem , and <unk> a <unk> towards them , it is society and my neighbor who are indebted to me . ” “ <unk> , ” cried Château-Renaud ; “ you are the first man I ever met sufficiently <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , count , <unk> ! ” “ It is <unk> , at least , ” said Morrel .
“ But I am sure that the count does not regret having once <unk> from the principles he has so <unk> <unk> . ” “ How have I <unk> from those principles , monsieur ? ” asked Monte Cristo , who could not help looking at Morrel with so much <unk> , that two or three times the young man had been unable to <unk> that clear and piercing glance .
“ Why , it seems to me , ” replied Morrel , “ that in <unk> M. de Morcerf , whom you did not know , you did good to your neighbor and to society . ” “ Of which he is the <unk> <unk> , ” said Beauchamp , drinking off a glass of <unk> .
“ My dear count , ” cried Morcerf , “ you are at fault — you , one of the most formidable <unk> I know — and you must see it clearly proved that instead of being an <unk> , you are a <unk> .
Ah , you call yourself <unk> , a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ; your family name is Monte Cristo ; Sinbad the <unk> is your <unk> <unk> , and yet the first day you set foot in Paris you instinctively display the greatest virtue , or rather the chief defect , of us eccentric <unk> , — that is , you assume the <unk> you have not , and conceal the virtues you possess . ” “ My dear <unk> , ” returned Monte Cristo , “ I do not see , in all I have done , anything that <unk> , either from you or these gentlemen , the pretended <unk> I have received .
You were no stranger to me , for I knew you from the time I gave up two rooms to you , invited you to breakfast with me , lent you one of my carriages , witnessed the Carnival in your company , and saw with you from a window in the Piazza del <unk> the execution that affected you so much that you nearly fainted .
I will appeal to any of these gentlemen , could I leave my guest in the hands of a hideous bandit , as you <unk> him ?
Besides , you know , I had the idea that you could introduce me into some of the Paris <unk> when I came to France .
You might some time ago have looked upon this resolution as a vague project , but today you see it was a reality , and you must submit to it under <unk> of breaking your word . ” “ I will keep it , ” returned Morcerf ; “ but I fear that you will be much disappointed , accustomed as you are to picturesque events and fantastic <unk> .
<unk> us you will not meet with any of those <unk> with which your <unk> existence has so <unk> you ; our <unk> is <unk> , our <unk> is <unk> <unk> , our Great <unk> is the plain of <unk> , where they are now <unk> an <unk> well to water the <unk> .
We have plenty of thieves , though not so many as is said ; but these thieves stand in far more dread of a <unk> than a lord .
France is so <unk> , and Paris so <unk> a city , that you will not find in its <unk> <unk> — I say <unk> , because I do not <unk> Corsica — you will not find , then , in these <unk> <unk> a single hill on which there is not a telegraph , or a grotto in which the <unk> of police has not put up a <unk> .
There is but one service I can render you , and for that I place myself entirely at your orders , that is , to present , or make my friends present , you everywhere ; besides , you have no need of anyone to introduce you — with your name , and your fortune , and your talent ” ( Monte Cristo bowed with a somewhat <unk> smile ) “ you can present yourself everywhere , and be well received .
I can be useful in one way only — if knowledge of Parisian habits , of the means of <unk> yourself comfortable , or of the <unk> , can assist , you may depend upon me to find you a <unk> dwelling here .
I do not dare offer to share my apartments with you , as I shared yours at Rome — I , who do not <unk> <unk> , but am yet <unk> _ <unk> <unk> _ ; for , except myself , these rooms would not hold a shadow more , unless that shadow were <unk> . ” “ Ah , ” said the count , “ that is a most <unk> <unk> ; I recollect that at Rome you said something of a projected marriage .
May I congratulate you ? ” “ The affair is still in <unk> . ” “ And he who says in ‘ <unk> , ’ means already decided , ” said Debray .
“ No , ” replied Morcerf , “ my father is most anxious about it ; and I hope , ere long , to introduce you , if not to my wife , at least to my betrothed — Mademoiselle Eugénie Danglars . ” “ Eugénie Danglars , ” said Monte Cristo ; “ tell me , is not her father Baron Danglars ? ” “ Yes , ” returned Morcerf , “ a baron of a new creation . ” “ What matter , ” said Monte Cristo “ if he has rendered the <unk> services which merit this distinction ? ” “ <unk> ones , ” answered Beauchamp .
“ Although in reality a <unk> , he <unk> a <unk> of six millions for Charles <unk> , in <unk> , who made him a baron and <unk> of the Legion of Honor ; so that he <unk> the ribbon , not , as you would think , in his <unk> , but at his <unk> . ” “ Ah , ” interrupted Morcerf , laughing , “ Beauchamp , Beauchamp , keep that for the _ <unk> _ or the _ <unk> _ , but spare my future <unk> before me . ” Then , turning to Monte Cristo , “ You just now spoke his name as if you knew the baron ? ” “ I do not know him , ” returned Monte Cristo ; “ but I shall probably soon make his acquaintance , for I have a credit opened with him by the house of <unk> &amp; <unk> , of London , <unk> &amp; <unk> of <unk> , and Thomson &amp; French at Rome . ” As he pronounced the two last names , the count glanced at Maximilian Morrel .
If the stranger expected to produce an effect on Morrel , he was not mistaken — Maximilian started as if he had been <unk> .
“ Thomson &amp; French , ” said he ; “ do you know this house , monsieur ? ” <unk> “ They are my <unk> in the capital of the Christian world , ” returned the count quietly .
“ Can my influence with them be of any service to you ? ” “ Oh , count , you could assist me perhaps in <unk> which have been , up to the present , <unk> .
This house , in past years , did ours a great service , and has , I know not for what reason , always denied having rendered us this service . ” “ I shall be at your orders , ” said Monte Cristo bowing .
“ But , ” continued Morcerf , “ _ à <unk> _ of Danglars , — we have strangely wandered from the subject .
We were speaking of a suitable <unk> for the Count of Monte Cristo .
Come , gentlemen , let us all propose some place .
Where shall we lodge this new guest in our great capital ? ” “ Faubourg <unk> , ” said Château-Renaud .
“ The count will find there a charming hotel , with a court and garden . ” “ Bah !
Château-Renaud , ” returned Debray , “ you only know your dull and gloomy Faubourg <unk> ; do not pay any attention to him , count — live in the <unk> d ’ <unk> , that ’ s the real centre of Paris . ” “ Boulevard de l ’ <unk> , ” said Beauchamp ; “ the second floor — a house with a <unk> .
The count will have his <unk> of silver cloth brought there , and as he <unk> his <unk> , see all Paris pass before him . ” “ You have no idea , then , Morrel ? ” asked Château-Renaud ; “ you do not propose anything . ” “ Oh , yes , ” returned the young man , smiling ; “ on the contrary , I have one , but I expected the count would be tempted by one of the brilliant <unk> made him , yet as he has not replied to any of them , I will venture to offer him a <unk> of apartments in a charming hotel , in the <unk> style , that my sister has inhabited for a year , in the Rue <unk> . ” “ You have a sister ? ” asked the count .
“ Yes , monsieur , a most excellent sister . ” “ <unk> ? ” “ Nearly nine years . ” “ <unk> ? ” asked the count again .
“ As happy as it is permitted to a human creature to be , ” replied Maximilian .
“ She married the man she loved , who remained faithful to us in our fallen <unk> — Emmanuel <unk> . ” Monte Cristo smiled <unk> .
“ I live there during my leave of absence , ” continued Maximilian ; “ and I shall be , together with my <unk> Emmanuel , at the disposition of the Count , whenever he thinks fit to honor us . ” “ One minute , ” cried Albert , without giving Monte Cristo the time to reply .
“ Take care , you are going to <unk> a traveller , Sinbad the <unk> , a man who comes to see Paris ; you are going to make a <unk> of him . ” <unk> “ Oh , no , ” said Morrel ; “ my sister is <unk> , my <unk> is thirty , they are gay , young , and happy .
Besides , the count will be in his own house , and only see them when he thinks fit to do so . ” “ Thanks , monsieur , ” said Monte Cristo ; “ I shall content myself with being presented to your sister and her husband , if you will do me the honor to introduce me ; but I cannot accept the offer of anyone of these gentlemen , since my <unk> is already prepared . ” “ What , ” cried Morcerf ; “ you are , then , going to a hotel — that will be very dull for you . ” “ Was I so badly <unk> at Rome ? ” said Monte Cristo smiling .
“ _ <unk> ! _ at Rome you spent fifty thousand piastres in <unk> your apartments , but I presume that you are not disposed to spend a similar sum every day . ” “ It is not that which <unk> me , ” replied Monte Cristo ; “ but as I determined to have a house to myself , I sent on my valet de chambre , and he ought by this time to have bought the house and furnished it . ” “ But you have , then , a valet de chambre who knows Paris ? ” said Beauchamp .
“ It is the first time he has ever been in Paris .
He is black , and cannot speak , ” returned Monte Cristo .
“ It is Ali ! ” cried Albert , in the midst of the general surprise .
“ Yes , Ali himself , my <unk> mute , whom you saw , I think , at Rome . ” “ Certainly , ” said Morcerf ; “ I recollect him perfectly .
But how could you charge a <unk> to purchase a house , and a mute to furnish it ? — he will do everything wrong . ” “ <unk> yourself , monsieur , ” replied Monte Cristo ; “ I am quite sure , that , on the contrary , he will choose everything as I wish .
He knows my <unk> , my <unk> , my wants .
He has been here a week , with the instinct of a <unk> , <unk> by himself .
He will arrange everything for me .
He knew , that I should arrive today at ten o ’ clock ; he was waiting for me at nine at the Barrière de <unk> .
He gave me this paper ; it contains the number of my new abode ; read it yourself , ” and Monte Cristo passed a paper to Albert .
“ Ah , that is really original , ” said Beauchamp .
“ And very <unk> , ” added Château-Renaud .
“ What , do you not know your house ? ” asked Debray .
“ No , ” said Monte Cristo ; “ I told you I did not wish to be behind my time ; I dressed myself in the carriage , and descended at the viscount ’ s door . ” The young men looked at each other ; they did not know if it was a <unk> Monte Cristo was playing , but every word he uttered had such an air of simplicity , that it was impossible to suppose what he said was false — besides , why should he tell a <unk> ?
“ We must content ourselves , then , ” said Beauchamp , “ with <unk> the count all the little services in our power .
I , in my quality of <unk> , open all the <unk> to him . ” “ Thanks , monsieur , ” returned Monte Cristo , “ my steward has orders to take a box at each theatre . ” “ Is your steward also a <unk> ? ” asked Debray .
“ No , he is a <unk> of yours , if a Corsican is a <unk> of anyone ’ s .
But you know him , M. de Morcerf . ” “ Is it that excellent M. Bertuccio , who <unk> <unk> windows so well ? ” “ Yes , you saw him the day I had the honor of receiving you ; he has been a soldier , a <unk> — in fact , everything .
I would not be quite sure that he has not been mixed up with the police for some trifle — a <unk> with a knife , for instance . ” “ And you have chosen this honest citizen for your steward , ” said Debray .
“ Of how much does he <unk> you every year ? ” “ On my word , ” replied the count , “ not more than another .
I am sure he <unk> my purpose , knows no <unk> , and so I keep him . ” “ Then , ” continued Château-Renaud , “ since you have an establishment , a steward , and a hotel in the Champs-Élysées , you only want a mistress . ” Albert smiled .
He thought of the fair Greek he had seen in the count ’ s box at the <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
“ I have something better than that , ” said Monte Cristo ; “ I have a slave .
You procure your <unk> from the <unk> , the <unk> , or the <unk> ; I purchased mine at <unk> ; it cost me more , but I have nothing to fear . ” “ But you forget , ” replied Debray , laughing , “ that we are <unk> by name and <unk> by nature , as King Charles said , and that the moment she <unk> her foot in France your slave becomes free . ” “ Who will tell her ? ” “ The first person who sees her . ” “ She only speaks <unk> . ” “ That is different . ” “ But at least we shall see her , ” said Beauchamp , “ or do you keep <unk> as well as <unk> ? ” “ Oh , no , ” replied Monte Cristo ; “ I do not carry <unk> so far .
<unk> who <unk> me is free to quit me , and when they leave me will no longer have any need of me or anyone else ; it is for that reason , perhaps , that they do not quit me . ” They had long since passed to <unk> and <unk> .
“ My dear Albert , ” said Debray , rising , “ it is half-past two .
Your guest is charming , but you leave the best company to go into the worst sometimes .
I must return to the minister ’ s .
I will tell him of the count , and we shall soon know who he is . ” “ Take care , ” returned Albert ; “ no one has been able to accomplish that . ” “ Oh , we have three millions for our police ; it is true they are almost always spent beforehand , but , no matter , we shall still have fifty thousand francs to spend for this purpose . ” “ And when you know , will you tell me ? ” “ I promise you .
_ <unk> <unk> _ , Albert .
Gentlemen , good morning . ” As he left the room , Debray called out loudly , “ My carriage . ” “ <unk> , ” said Beauchamp to Albert ; “ I shall not go to the Chamber , but I have something better to offer my <unk> than a speech of M. Danglars . ” “ For heaven ’ s sake , Beauchamp , ” returned Morcerf , “ do not <unk> me of the merit of <unk> him everywhere .
Is he not peculiar ? ” “ He is more than that , ” replied Château-Renaud ; “ he is one of the most extraordinary men I ever saw in my life .
Are you coming , Morrel ? ” “ <unk> I have given my card to the count , who has promised to pay us a visit at Rue <unk> , No .
<unk> . ” “ Be sure I shall not fail to do so , ” returned the count , bowing .
And Maximilian Morrel left the room with the Baron de Château-Renaud , leaving Monte Cristo alone with Morcerf .
Chapter <unk> .
The <unk> When Albert found himself alone with Monte Cristo , “ My dear count , ” said he , “ allow me to <unk> my services as _ <unk> _ by showing you a <unk> of a <unk> ’ s apartment .
You , who are accustomed to the <unk> of Italy , can amuse yourself by <unk> in how many square feet a young man who is not the worst <unk> in Paris can live .
As we pass from one room to another , I will open the windows to let you breathe . ” Monte Cristo had already seen the <unk> and the salon on the ground floor .
Albert led him first to his _ <unk> _ , which was , as we have said , his favorite apartment .
Monte Cristo quickly <unk> all that Albert had collected here — old <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> glass , arms from all parts of the world — everything was familiar to him ; and at the first glance he recognized their date , their country , and their origin .
Morcerf had expected he should be the guide ; on the contrary , it was he who , under the count ’ s <unk> , followed a course of <unk> , <unk> , and natural history .
They descended to the first floor ; Albert led his guest into the salon .
The salon was filled with the works of modern <unk> ; there were <unk> by <unk> , with their long <unk> and tall trees , their <unk> <unk> and marvellous <unk> ; <unk> ’ s Arabian <unk> , with their long white <unk> , their shining <unk> , their <unk> arms , their horses , who tore each other with their teeth while their <unk> <unk> <unk> with their <unk> ; _ <unk> _ of <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> de Paris with that <unk> that makes the artist the <unk> of the poet ; there were <unk> by <unk> , who makes his flowers more beautiful than flowers , his <unk> more brilliant than the sun ; <unk> by <unk> , as <unk> <unk> as those of <unk> <unk> , but more <unk> ; _ <unk> _ by <unk> and <unk> , <unk> children like angels and women with the features of a virgin ; <unk> torn from the <unk> of <unk> ’ “ <unk> in the East , ” that had been made in a few seconds on the <unk> of a <unk> , or beneath the <unk> of a <unk> — in a word , all that modern art can give in exchange and as recompense for the art lost and gone with <unk> long since past .
Albert expected to have something new this time to show to the traveller , but , to his great surprise , the latter , without seeking for the <unk> , many of which , indeed , were only <unk> , named instantly the author of every picture in such a manner that it was easy to see that each name was not only known to him , but that each style associated with it had been <unk> and studied by him .
From the salon they passed into the <unk> ; it was a <unk> of taste and simple elegance .
A single portrait , signed by <unk> Robert , shone in its <unk> and gilded frame .
This portrait attracted the Count of Monte Cristo ’ s attention , for he made three rapid steps in the chamber , and stopped suddenly before it .
It was the portrait of a young woman of five or <unk> , with a dark complexion , and light and <unk> eyes , veiled beneath long <unk> .
She wore the picturesque costume of the <unk> <unk> , a red and black <unk> , and golden <unk> in her hair .
She was looking at the sea , and her form was outlined on the blue ocean and sky .
The light was so faint in the room that Albert did not perceive the pallor that spread itself over the count ’ s visage , or the nervous <unk> of his chest and shoulders .
Silence prevailed for an instant , during which Monte Cristo gazed intently on the picture .
“ You have there a most charming mistress , viscount , ” said the count in a perfectly calm tone ; “ and this costume — a ball costume , doubtless — becomes her admirably . ” “ Ah , monsieur , ” returned Albert , “ I would never forgive you this mistake if you had seen another picture beside this .
You do not know my mother ; she it is whom you see here .
She had her portrait painted thus six or eight years ago .
This costume is a fancy one , it appears , and the resemblance is so great that I think I still see my mother the same as she was in 1830 .
The countess had this portrait painted during the count ’ s absence .
She doubtless intended giving him an agreeable surprise ; but , strange to say , this portrait seemed to <unk> my father , and the value of the picture , which is , as you see , one of the best works of <unk> Robert , could not overcome his dislike to it .
It is true , between ourselves , that M. de Morcerf is one of the most <unk> <unk> at the Luxembourg , a general <unk> for theory , but a most <unk> <unk> of art .
It is different with my mother , who <unk> exceedingly well , and who , unwilling to part with so valuable a picture , gave it to me to put here , where it would be less likely to <unk> M. de Morcerf , whose portrait , by <unk> , I will also show you .
Excuse my talking of family matters , but as I shall have the honor of <unk> you to the count , I tell you this to prevent you making any <unk> to this picture .
The picture seems to have a <unk> influence , for my mother rarely comes here without looking at it , and still more rarely does she look at it without weeping .
This <unk> is the only one that has ever taken place between the count and countess , who are still as much united , although married more than twenty years , as on the first day of their wedding . ” <unk> Monte Cristo glanced rapidly at Albert , as if to seek a hidden meaning in his words , but it was evident the young man uttered them in the simplicity of his heart .
“ Now , ” said Albert , “ that you have seen all my treasures , allow me to offer them to you , unworthy as they are .
<unk> yourself as in your own house , and to put yourself still more at your ease , pray accompany me to the apartments of M. de Morcerf , he whom I wrote from Rome an account of the services you rendered me , and to whom I announced your promised visit , and I may say that both the count and countess anxiously desire to thank you in person .
You are somewhat _ <unk> _ I know , and family scenes have not much effect on Sinbad the <unk> , who has seen so many others .
However , accept what I propose to you as an <unk> into Parisian life — a life of politeness , visiting , and <unk> . ” Monte Cristo bowed without making any answer ; he accepted the offer without enthusiasm and without regret , as one of those <unk> of society which every gentleman looks upon as a duty .
Albert summoned his servant , and ordered him to <unk> M. and Madame de Morcerf of the arrival of the Count of Monte Cristo .
Albert followed him with the count .
When they arrived at the antechamber , above the door was visible a <unk> , which , by its rich <unk> and its <unk> with the rest of the furniture , indicated the importance the owner attached to this <unk> .
Monte Cristo stopped and examined it attentively .
“ <unk> seven <unk> , or , placed <unk> , ” said he .
“ These are , doubtless , your family arms ?
Except the knowledge of <unk> , that <unk> me to <unk> them , I am very ignorant of <unk> — I , a count of a fresh creation , <unk> in <unk> by the aid of a <unk> of St. <unk> , and who would not have taken the trouble had I not been told that when you travel much it is necessary .
Besides , you must have something on the <unk> of your carriage , to escape being searched by the <unk> officers .
Excuse my putting such a question to you . ” “ It is not <unk> , ” returned Morcerf , with the simplicity of conviction .
“ You have guessed rightly .
These are our arms , that is , those of my father , but they are , as you see , joined to another <unk> , which has <unk> , a silver tower , which are my mother ’ s .
By her side I am Spanish , but the family of Morcerf is French , and , I have heard , one of the <unk> of the south of France . ” “ Yes , ” replied Monte Cristo “ these <unk> prove that .
<unk> all the armed <unk> that went to the Holy <unk> took for their arms either a cross , in honor of their mission , or birds of passage , in sign of the long voyage they were about to <unk> , and which they hoped to accomplish on the wings of faith .
One of your <unk> had joined the <unk> , and supposing it to be only that of St. Louis , that makes you <unk> to the <unk> century , which is tolerably ancient . ” “ It is possible , ” said Morcerf ; “ my father has in his study a <unk> tree which will tell you all that , and on which I made <unk> that would have greatly <unk> d ’ <unk> and <unk> .
At present I no longer think of it , and yet I must tell you that we are beginning to occupy ourselves greatly with these things under our popular government . ” “ Well , then , your government would do well to choose from the past something better than the things that I have noticed on your <unk> , and which have no <unk> meaning whatever .
As for you , viscount , ” continued Monte Cristo to Morcerf , “ you are more fortunate than the government , for your arms are really beautiful , and speak to the imagination .
Yes , you are at once from <unk> and Spain ; that <unk> , if the portrait you showed me be like , the dark hue I so much admired on the visage of the noble <unk> . ” It would have required the <unk> of <unk> or the <unk> to have divined the <unk> the count concealed beneath these words , apparently uttered with the greatest politeness .
Morcerf thanked him with a smile , and pushed open the door above which were his arms , and which , as we have said , opened into the salon .
In the most <unk> part of the salon was another portrait .
It was that of a man , from five to <unk> , in the uniform of a general officer , wearing the double <unk> of heavy <unk> , that <unk> superior rank , the ribbon of the Legion of Honor around his neck , which showed he was a <unk> , and on the right breast , the star of a grand officer of the order of the <unk> , and on the left that of the grand cross of Charles <unk> . , which proved that the person represented by the picture had served in the <unk> of Greece and Spain , or , what was just the same thing as regarded <unk> , had <unk> some <unk> mission in the two countries .
Monte Cristo was engaged in examining this portrait with no less care than he had bestowed upon the other , when another door opened , and he found himself opposite to the Count of Morcerf in person .
He was a man of forty to <unk> years , but he seemed at least fifty , and his black <unk> and eyebrows <unk> strangely with his almost white hair , which was cut short , in the military fashion .
He was dressed in plain clothes , and wore at his <unk> the <unk> of the different orders to which he belonged .
He entered with a tolerably <unk> step , and some little haste .
Monte Cristo saw him advance towards him without making a single step .
It seemed as if his feet were <unk> to the ground , and his eyes on the Count of Morcerf .
“ Father , ” said the young man , “ I have the honor of presenting to you the Count of Monte Cristo , the generous friend whom I had the good fortune to meet in the <unk> situation of which I have told you . ” “ You are most welcome , monsieur , ” said the Count of Morcerf , <unk> Monte Cristo with a smile , “ and monsieur has rendered our house , in <unk> its only heir , a service which <unk> him our eternal gratitude . ” As he said these words , the count of Morcerf pointed to a chair , while he seated himself in another opposite the window .
Monte Cristo , in taking the seat Morcerf offered him , placed himself in such a manner as to remain concealed in the shadow of the large velvet curtains , and read on the <unk> and livid features of the count a whole history of secret <unk> written in each <unk> time had planted there .
“ The countess , ” said Morcerf , “ was at her toilet when she was informed of the visit she was about to receive .
She will , however , be in the salon in ten minutes . ” “ It is a great honor to me , ” returned Monte Cristo , “ to be thus , on the first day of my arrival in Paris , brought in contact with a man whose merit <unk> his reputation , and to whom fortune has for once been <unk> , but has she not still on the <unk> of <unk> , or in the mountains of <unk> , a <unk> ’ s <unk> to offer you ? ” “ Oh , ” replied Morcerf , <unk> slightly , “ I have left the service , monsieur .
<unk> a <unk> at the Restoration , I served through the first <unk> under the orders of <unk> <unk> .
I could , therefore , expect a higher rank , and who knows what might have happened had the elder branch remained on the throne ?
But the Revolution of July was , it seems , sufficiently <unk> to allow itself to be <unk> , and it was so for all services that did not date from the <unk> period .
I <unk> my resignation , for when you have gained your <unk> on the <unk> , you do not know how to <unk> on the <unk> grounds of the <unk> .
I have hung up my sword , and cast myself into politics .
I have devoted myself to <unk> ; I study the useful <unk> .
During the twenty years I served , I often wished to do so , but I had not the time . ” “ These are the ideas that render your nation superior to any other , ” returned Monte Cristo .
“ A gentleman of high birth , <unk> of an <unk> fortune , you have <unk> to gain your <unk> as an obscure soldier , step by step — this is <unk> ; then become general , <unk> of France , <unk> of the Legion of Honor , you consent to again <unk> a second <unk> , without any other hope or any other desire than that of one day becoming useful to your <unk> ; this , indeed , is <unk> , — nay , more , it is sublime . ” <unk> Albert looked on and listened with astonishment ; he was not used to see Monte Cristo give vent to such <unk> of enthusiasm .
“ Alas , ” continued the stranger , doubtless to <unk> the slight cloud that covered Morcerf ’ s brow , “ we do not act thus in Italy ; we grow according to our race and our species , and we pursue the same lines , and often the same <unk> , all our lives . ” “ But , monsieur , ” said the Count of Morcerf , “ for a man of your merit , Italy is not a country , and France opens her arms to receive you ; <unk> to her call .
France will not , perhaps , be always <unk> .
She <unk> her children ill , but she always <unk> strangers . ” “ Ah , father , ” said Albert with a smile , “ it is evident you do not know the Count of Monte Cristo ; he <unk> all <unk> , and contents himself with those written on his passport . ” “ That is the most just remark , ” replied the stranger , “ I ever heard made concerning myself . ” “ You have been free to choose your career , ” observed the Count of Morcerf , with a sigh ; “ and you have chosen the path <unk> with flowers . ” “ <unk> , monsieur , ” replied Monte Cristo with one of those smiles that a <unk> could never <unk> or a <unk> <unk> .
“ If I did not fear to fatigue you , ” said the general , evidently <unk> with the count ’ s manners , “ I would have taken you to the Chamber ; there is a <unk> very curious to those who are strangers to our modern <unk> . ” “ I shall be most grateful , monsieur , if you will , at some future time , <unk> your offer , but I have been flattered with the hope of being introduced to the countess , and I will therefore wait . ” “ Ah , here is my mother , ” cried the viscount .
Monte Cristo , turned round hastily , and saw Madame de Morcerf at the entrance of the salon , at the door opposite to that by which her husband had entered , pale and motionless ; when Monte Cristo turned round , she let fall her arm , which for some unknown reason had been resting on the gilded <unk> .
She had been there some moments , and had heard the last words of the visitor .
The latter rose and bowed to the countess , who inclined herself without speaking .
“ Ah !
good heavens , madame , ” said the count , “ are you ill , or is it the heat of the room that <unk> you ? ” “ Are you ill , mother ? ” cried the viscount , <unk> towards her .
She thanked them both with a smile .
“ No , ” returned she , “ but I feel some emotion on seeing , for the first time , the man without whose <unk> we should have been in tears and <unk> .
Monsieur , ” continued the countess , advancing with the majesty of a <unk> , “ I owe to you the life of my son , and for this I bless you .
Now , I thank you for the pleasure you give me in thus <unk> me the opportunity of <unk> you as I have blessed you , from the bottom of my heart . ” The count bowed again , but lower than before ; he was even <unk> than Mercédès .
“ Madame , ” said he , “ the count and yourself recompense too <unk> a simple action .
To save a man , to spare a father ’ s feelings , or a mother ’ s <unk> , is not to do a good action , but a simple deed of humanity . ” At these words , uttered with the most exquisite sweetness and politeness , Madame de Morcerf replied : “ It is very fortunate for my son , monsieur , that he found such a friend , and I thank God that things are thus . ” And Mercédès raised her fine eyes to heaven with so <unk> an expression of gratitude , that the count fancied he saw tears in them .
M. de Morcerf approached her .
“ Madame , ” said he .
“ I have already made my <unk> to the count for quitting him , and I pray you to do so also .
The sitting <unk> at two ; it is now three , and I am to speak . ” “ Go , then , and monsieur and I will <unk> our best to forget your absence , ” replied the countess , with the same tone of deep feeling .
“ Monsieur , ” continued she , turning to Monte Cristo , “ will you do us the honor of passing the rest of the day with us ? ” “ Believe me , madame , I feel most grateful for your kindness , but I got out of my travelling carriage at your door this morning , and I am ignorant how I am <unk> in Paris , which I scarcely know ; this is but a trifling <unk> , I know , but one that may be <unk> . ” “ We shall have the pleasure another time , ” said the countess ; “ you promise that ? ” Monte Cristo inclined himself without answering , but the gesture might pass for <unk> .
“ I will not <unk> you , monsieur , ” continued the countess ; “ I would not have our gratitude become <unk> or <unk> . ” “ My dear Count , ” said Albert , “ I will endeavor to return your politeness at Rome , and place my <unk> at your disposal until your own be ready . ” “ A thousand thanks for your kindness , viscount , ” returned the Count of Monte Cristo “ but I suppose that M. Bertuccio has <unk> employed the four hours and a half I have given him , and that I shall find a carriage of some sort ready at the door . ” Albert was used to the count ’ s manner of proceeding ; he knew that , like <unk> , he was in search of the impossible , and nothing astonished him , but wishing to judge with his own eyes how far the count ’ s orders had been executed , he accompanied him to the door of the house .
Monte Cristo was not deceived .
As soon as he appeared in the Count of Morcerf ’ s antechamber , a <unk> , the same who at Rome had brought the count ’ s card to the two young men , and announced his visit , sprang into the <unk> , and when he arrived at the door the illustrious traveller found his carriage awaiting him .
It was a _ <unk> _ of <unk> ’ s building , and with horses and <unk> for which <unk> had , to the knowledge of all the <unk> of Paris , refused on the previous day seven hundred <unk> .
“ Monsieur , ” said the count to Albert , “ I do not ask you to accompany me to my house , as I can only show you a <unk> fitted up in a hurry , and I have , as you know , a reputation to keep up as <unk> not being taken by surprise .
Give me , therefore , one more day before I invite you ; I shall then be certain not to fail in my hospitality . ” “ If you ask me for a day , count , I know what to <unk> ; it will not be a house I shall see , but a palace .
You have decidedly some genius at your <unk> . ” “ _ Ma foi _ , spread that idea , ” replied the Count of Monte Cristo , putting his foot on the <unk> steps of his splendid carriage , “ and that will be worth something to me among the ladies . ” As he spoke , he sprang into the vehicle , the door was closed , but not so rapidly that Monte Cristo failed to perceive the almost imperceptible movement which stirred the curtains of the apartment in which he had left Madame de Morcerf .
When Albert returned to his mother , he found her in the <unk> <unk> in a large velvet armchair , the whole room so obscure that only the shining <unk> , fastened here and there to the <unk> , and the angles of the gilded <unk> of the <unk> , showed with some degree of <unk> in the gloom .
Albert could not see the face of the countess , as it was covered with a thin veil she had put on her head , and which fell over her features in <unk> folds , but it seemed to him as though her voice had altered .
He could distinguish amid the <unk> of the roses and <unk> in the <unk> , the sharp and <unk> odor of <unk> <unk> , and he noticed in one of the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> the countess ’ s <unk> , taken from its <unk> case , and exclaimed in a tone of uneasiness , as he entered : “ My dear mother , have you been ill during my absence ? ” “ No , no , Albert , but you know these roses , <unk> , and <unk> throw out at first , before one is used to them , such violent <unk> . ” “ Then , my dear mother , ” said Albert , putting his hand to the bell , “ they must be taken into the antechamber .
You are really ill , and just now were so pale as you came into the room — — ” “ Was I pale , Albert ? ” “ Yes ; a pallor that <unk> you admirably , mother , but which did not the less alarm my father and myself . ” “ Did your father speak of it ? ” inquired Mercédès eagerly .
“ No , madame ; but do you not remember that he spoke of the fact to you ? ” <unk> “ Yes , I do remember , ” replied the countess .
A servant entered , summoned by Albert ’ s ring of the bell .
“ Take these flowers into the <unk> or dressing-room , ” said the viscount ; “ they make the countess ill . ” The <unk> obeyed his orders .
A long pause ensued , which lasted until all the flowers were removed .
“ What is this name of Monte Cristo ? ” inquired the countess , when the servant had taken away the last <unk> of flowers , “ is it a family name , or the name of the estate , or a simple title ? ” “ I believe , mother , it is merely a title .
The count purchased an island in the <unk> <unk> , and , as he told you today , has <unk> a <unk> .
You know the same thing was done for Saint <unk> of <unk> , Saint <unk> <unk> of <unk> , and even for the <unk> of <unk> .
Except this , he has no <unk> to nobility , and calls himself a chance count , although the general opinion at Rome is that the count is a man of very high distinction . ” “ His manners are admirable , ” said the countess , “ at least , as far as I could judge in the few minutes he remained here . ” “ They are perfect mother , so perfect , that they <unk> by far all I have known in the leading <unk> of the three <unk> <unk> of Europe — the English , the Spanish , and the German . ” The countess paused a moment ; then , after a slight hesitation , she resumed .
“ You have seen , my dear Albert — I ask the question as a mother — you have seen M. de Monte Cristo in his house , you are <unk> , have much knowledge of the world , more <unk> than is usual at your age , do you think the count is really what he appears to be ? ” “ What does he appear to be ? ” “ Why , you have just said , — a man of high distinction . ” “ I told you , my dear mother , he was <unk> such . ” “ But what is your own opinion , Albert ? ” “ I must tell you that I have not come to any decided opinion respecting him , but I think him a <unk> . ” “ I do not ask you of his origin but what he is . ” “ Ah !
what he is ; that is quite another thing .
I have seen so many remarkable things in him , that if you would have me really say what I think , I shall reply that I really do look upon him as one of <unk> ’ s heroes , whom misery has marked with a fatal <unk> ; some <unk> , some <unk> , some <unk> , one of those <unk> , as it were , of some ancient family , who , <unk> of their <unk> , have <unk> one by the force of their <unk> genius , which has placed them above the laws of society . ” “ You say — — ” “ I say that Monte Cristo is an island in the midst of the <unk> , without inhabitants or <unk> , the <unk> of smugglers of all nations , and <unk> of every flag .
Who knows whether or not these <unk> <unk> do not pay to their <unk> lord some <unk> for his protection ? ” “ That is possible , ” said the countess , <unk> .
“ Never mind , ” continued the young man , “ <unk> or not , you must agree , mother dear , as you have seen him , that the Count of Monte Cristo is a remarkable man , who will have the greatest success in the <unk> of Paris .
Why , this very morning , in my rooms , he made his _ <unk> _ amongst us by striking every man of us with amazement , not even excepting Château-Renaud . ” “ And what do you suppose is the count ’ s age ? ” inquired Mercédès , evidently <unk> great importance to this question .
“ <unk> or <unk> , mother . ” “ So young , — it is impossible , ” said Mercédès , replying at the same time to what Albert said as well as to her own private reflection .
“ It is the truth , however .
Three or four times he has said to me , and certainly without the slightest <unk> , ‘ at such a period I was five years old , at another ten years old , at another twelve , ’ and I , induced by curiosity , which kept me alive to these details , have compared the <unk> , and never found him <unk> .
The age of this singular man , who is of no age , is then , I am certain , <unk> .
Besides , mother , remark how <unk> his eye , how <unk> his hair , and his brow , though so pale , is free from <unk> , — he is not only <unk> , but also young . ” The countess bent her head , as if beneath a heavy wave of bitter thoughts .
“ And has this man displayed a friendship for you , Albert ? ” she asked with a nervous shudder .
“ I am inclined to think so . ” “ And — do — you — like — him ? ” “ Why , he pleases me in spite of Franz d ’ Épinay , who <unk> to convince me that he is a being returned from the other world . ” The countess shuddered .
“ Albert , ” she said , in a voice which was altered by emotion , “ I have always put you on your guard against new <unk> .
Now you are a man , and are able to give me advice ; yet I repeat to you , Albert , be prudent . ” “ Why , my dear mother , it is necessary , in order to make your advice turn to account , that I should know beforehand what I have to distrust .
The count never plays , he only <unk> pure water <unk> with a little <unk> , and is so rich that he cannot , without intending to laugh at me , try to <unk> money .
What , then , have I to fear from him ? ” “ You are right , ” said the countess , “ and my fears are weakness , especially when directed against a man who has saved your life .
How did your father receive him , Albert ?
It is necessary that we should be more than <unk> to the count .
M. de Morcerf is sometimes occupied , his business makes him <unk> , and he might , without intending it — — ” “ Nothing could be in better taste than my father ’ s <unk> , madame , ” said Albert ; “ nay , more , he seemed greatly flattered at two or three compliments which the count very <unk> and <unk> paid him with as much ease as if he had known him these thirty years .
Each of these little <unk> <unk> must have pleased my father , ” added Albert with a laugh .
“ And thus they parted the best possible friends , and M. de Morcerf even wished to take him to the Chamber to hear the <unk> . ” The countess made no reply .
She fell into so deep a reverie that her eyes gradually closed .
The young man , standing up before her , gazed upon her with that <unk> affection which is so tender and <unk> with children whose mothers are still young and handsome .
Then , after seeing her eyes closed , and hearing her breathe gently , he believed she had dropped asleep , and left the apartment on <unk> , closing the door after him with the utmost precaution .
“ This devil of a fellow , ” he muttered , shaking his head ; “ I said at the time he would create a sensation here , and I measure his effect by an <unk> <unk> .
My mother has noticed him , and he must therefore , <unk> , be remarkable . ” He went down to the <unk> , not without some slight <unk> , when he remembered that the Count of Monte Cristo had laid his hands on a “ <unk> ” which sent his <unk> down to second place in the opinion of <unk> .
“ Most decidedly , ” said he , “ men are not equal , and I must beg my father to <unk> this <unk> in the Chamber of <unk> . ” Chapter <unk> .
Monsieur Bertuccio Meanwhile the count had arrived at his house ; it had taken him six minutes to perform the distance , but these six minutes were sufficient to induce twenty young men who knew the price of the <unk> they had been unable to purchase themselves , to put their horses in a <unk> in order to see the rich <unk> who could afford to give <unk> francs <unk> for his horses .
The house Ali had chosen , and which was to serve as a town residence to Monte Cristo , was situated on the right hand as you ascend the Champs-Élysées .
A thick <unk> of trees and <unk> rose in the centre , and masked a portion of the front ; around this <unk> two <unk> , like two arms , extended right and left , and formed a <unk> from the iron gates to a double <unk> , on every step of which stood a <unk> <unk> , filled with flowers .
This house , isolated from the rest , had , besides the main entrance , another in the Rue de <unk> .
Even before the coachman had <unk> the _ concierge _ , the <unk> gates rolled on their hinges — they had seen the Count coming , and at Paris , as everywhere else , he was served with the rapidity of lightning .
The coachman entered and traversed the <unk> without <unk> his speed , and the gates were closed ere the wheels had ceased to sound on the <unk> .
The carriage stopped at the left side of the <unk> , two men presented themselves at the <unk> ; the one was Ali , who , smiling with an expression of the most sincere joy , seemed <unk> <unk> by a mere look from Monte Cristo .
The other bowed <unk> , and offered his arm to assist the count in descending .
“ Thanks , M. Bertuccio , ” said the count , <unk> lightly up the three steps of the <unk> ; “ and the notary ? ” “ He is in the small salon , excellency , ” returned Bertuccio .
“ And the cards I ordered to be <unk> as soon as you knew the number of the house ? ” “ Your excellency , it is done already .
I have been myself to the best <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , who did the plate in my presence .
The first card struck off was taken , according to your orders , to the Baron Danglars , Rue de la <unk> d ’ <unk> , No .
7 ; the others are on the <unk> of your excellency ’ s bedroom . ” “ Good ; what o ’ clock is it ? ” “ Four o ’ clock . ” Monte Cristo gave his hat , cane , and gloves to the same French <unk> who had called his carriage at the Count of Morcerf ’ s , and then he passed into the small salon , preceded by Bertuccio , who showed him the way .
“ These are but indifferent <unk> in this antechamber , ” said Monte Cristo .
“ I trust all this will soon be taken away . ” Bertuccio bowed .
As the steward had said , the notary awaited him in the small salon .
He was a <unk> lawyer ’ s clerk , elevated to the extraordinary dignity of a <unk> <unk> .
“ You are the notary <unk> to sell the country house that I wish to purchase , monsieur ? ” asked Monte Cristo .
“ Yes , count , ” returned the notary .
“ Is the deed of <unk> ready ? ” “ Yes , count . ” “ Have you brought it ? ” “ Here it is . ” “ Very well ; and where is this house that I purchase ? ” asked the count <unk> , addressing himself half to Bertuccio , half to the notary .
The steward made a gesture that signified , “ I do not know . ” The notary looked at the count with astonishment .
“ What ! ” said he , “ does not the count know where the house he <unk> is situated ? ” “ No , ” returned the count .
“ The count does not know ? ” “ How should I know ?
I have arrived from <unk> this morning .
I have never before been at Paris , and it is the first time I have ever even set my foot in France . ” “ Ah , that is different ; the house you purchase is at Auteuil . ” At these words Bertuccio turned pale .
“ And where is Auteuil ? ” asked the count .
“ <unk> by here , monsieur , ” replied the notary — “ a little beyond <unk> ; a charming situation , in the heart of the <unk> de <unk> . ” “ So near as that ? ” said the Count ; “ but that is not in the country .
What made you choose a house at the gates of Paris , M. Bertuccio ? ” “ I , ” cried the steward with a strange expression .
“ His excellency did not charge me to purchase this house .
If his excellency will recollect — if he will think — — ” “ Ah , true , ” observed Monte Cristo ; “ I recollect now .
I read the <unk> in one of the papers , and was tempted by the false title , ‘ a country house . ’ ” “ It is not yet too late , ” cried Bertuccio , eagerly ; “ and if your excellency will <unk> me with the commission , I will find you a better at <unk> , at <unk> , or at <unk> . ” “ Oh , no , ” returned Monte Cristo <unk> ; “ since I have this , I will keep it . ” “ And you are quite right , ” said the notary , who feared to lose his fee .
“ It is a charming place , well supplied with <unk> and fine trees ; a comfortable <unk> , although abandoned for a long time , without <unk> the furniture , which , although old , is yet valuable , now that old things are so much sought after .
I suppose the count has the <unk> of the day ? ” “ To be sure , ” returned Monte Cristo ; “ it is very convenient , then ? ” “ It is more — it is magnificent . ” “ _ <unk> ! _ let us not lose such an opportunity , ” returned Monte Cristo .
“ The deed , if you please , Mr. <unk> . ” And he signed it rapidly , after having first run his eye over that part of the deed in which were <unk> the situation of the house and the names of the <unk> .
“ Bertuccio , ” said he , “ give <unk> thousand francs to monsieur . ” The steward left the room with a <unk> step , and returned with a bundle of bank-notes , which the notary counted like a man who never gives a receipt for money until after he is sure it is all there .
“ And now , ” demanded the count , “ are all the forms <unk> with ? ” “ All , sir . ” “ Have you the keys ? ” “ They are in the hands of the concierge , who takes care of the house , but here is the order I have given him to <unk> the count in his new <unk> . ” “ Very well ; ” and Monte Cristo made a sign with his hand to the notary , which said , “ I have no further need of you ; you may go . ” “ But , ” observed the honest notary , “ the count is , I think , mistaken ; it is only fifty thousand francs , everything included . ” “ And your fee ? ” “ Is included in this sum . ” “ But have you not come from Auteuil here ? ” “ Yes , certainly . ” “ Well , then , it is but fair that you should be paid for your loss of time and trouble , ” said the count ; and he made a gesture of <unk> <unk> .
The notary left the room <unk> , and bowing down to the ground ; it was the first time he had ever met a similar <unk> .
“ See this gentleman out , ” said the count to Bertuccio .
And the steward followed the notary out of the room .
<unk> was the count alone , when he drew from his pocket a book closed with a lock , and opened it with a key which he wore round his neck , and which never left him .
After having sought for a few minutes , he stopped at a <unk> which had several notes , and compared them with the deed of <unk> , which lay on the table , and <unk> his _ <unk> _ — “ ‘ Auteuil , Rue de la <unk> , No .
<unk> ; ’ it is indeed the same , ” said he ; “ and now , am I to rely upon an <unk> <unk> by religious or physical terror ?
However , in an hour I shall know all .
Bertuccio ! ” cried he , striking a light <unk> with a <unk> handle on a small <unk> .
“ Bertuccio ! ” The steward appeared at the door .
“ Monsieur Bertuccio , ” said the count , “ did you never tell me that you had travelled in France ? ” “ In some parts of France — yes , excellency . ” “ You know the <unk> of Paris , then ? ” “ No , excellency , no , ” returned the steward , with a sort of nervous trembling , which Monte Cristo , a <unk> in all emotions , rightly attributed to great <unk> .
“ It is unfortunate , ” returned he , “ that you have never visited the <unk> , for I wish to see my new property this evening , and had you gone with me , you could have given me some useful information . ” “ To Auteuil ! ” cried Bertuccio , whose <unk> complexion became livid — “ I go to Auteuil ? ” “ Well , what is there surprising in that ?
When I live at Auteuil , you must come there , as you belong to my service . ” Bertuccio hung down his head before the <unk> look of his master , and remained motionless , without making any answer .
“ Why , what has happened to you ? — are you going to make me ring a second time for the carriage ? ” asked Monte Cristo , in the same tone that Louis <unk> .
pronounced the famous , “ I have been almost obliged to wait . ” Bertuccio made but one bound to the antechamber , and cried in a hoarse voice : “ His excellency ’ s horses ! ” Monte Cristo wrote two or three notes , and , as he sealed the last , the steward appeared .
“ Your excellency ’ s carriage is at the door , ” said he .
“ Well , take your hat and gloves , ” returned Monte Cristo .
“ Am I to accompany you , your excellency ? ” cried Bertuccio .
“ Certainly , you must give the orders , for I intend <unk> at the house . ” <unk> It was <unk> for a servant of the count ’ s to dare to <unk> an order of his , so the steward , without saying a word , followed his master , who got into the carriage , and signed to him to follow , which he did , taking his place <unk> on the front seat .
Chapter <unk> .
The House at Auteuil Monte Cristo noticed , as they descended the staircase , that Bertuccio signed himself in the Corsican manner ; that is , had formed the sign of the cross in the air with his <unk> , and as he seated himself in the carriage , muttered a short prayer .
<unk> but a man of <unk> thirst for knowledge would have had pity on seeing the steward ’ s extraordinary <unk> for the count ’ s projected drive without the walls ; but the count was too curious to let Bertuccio off from this little journey .
In twenty minutes they were at Auteuil ; the steward ’ s emotion had continued to <unk> as they entered the village .
Bertuccio , <unk> in the corner of the carriage , began to examine with a feverish anxiety every house they passed .
“ Tell them to stop at Rue de la <unk> , No .
<unk> , ” said the count , fixing his eyes on the steward , to whom he gave this order .
Bertuccio ’ s forehead was covered with perspiration ; however , he obeyed , and , leaning out of the window , he cried to the coachman , — “ Rue de la <unk> , No .
<unk> . ” No .
<unk> was situated at the extremity of the village ; during the drive night had set in , and darkness gave the <unk> the <unk> appearance of a scene on the stage .
The carriage stopped , the <unk> sprang off the box and opened the door .
“ Well , ” said the count , “ you do not get out , M. Bertuccio — you are going to stay in the carriage , then ?
What are you thinking of this evening ? ” Bertuccio sprang out , and offered his shoulder to the count , who , this time , leaned upon it as he descended the three steps of the carriage .
“ <unk> , ” said the count , “ and announce me . ” Bertuccio knocked , the door opened , and the concierge appeared .
“ What is it ? ” asked he .
“ It is your new master , my good fellow , ” said the <unk> .
And he held out to the concierge the notary ’ s order .
“ The house is sold , then ? ” demanded the concierge ; “ and this gentleman is coming to live here ? ” “ Yes , my friend , ” returned the count ; “ and I will endeavor to give you no cause to regret your old master . ” “ Oh , monsieur , ” said the concierge , “ I shall not have much cause to regret him , for he came here but seldom ; it is five years since he was here last , and he did well to sell the house , for it did not bring him in anything at all . ” “ What was the name of your old master ? ” said Monte Cristo .
“ The Marquis of Saint-Méran .
Ah , I am sure he has not sold the house for what he gave for it . ” “ The Marquis of Saint-Méran ! ” returned the count .
“ The name is not unknown to me ; the Marquis of Saint-Méran ! ” and he appeared to <unk> .
“ An old gentleman , ” continued the concierge , “ a <unk> <unk> of the <unk> ; he had an only daughter , who married M. de Villefort , who had been the king ’ s attorney at <unk> , and afterwards at <unk> . ” Monte Cristo glanced at Bertuccio , who became <unk> than the wall against which he leaned to prevent himself from falling .
“ And is not this daughter dead ? ” demanded Monte Cristo ; “ I fancy I have heard so . ” “ Yes , monsieur , <unk> years ago ; and since then we have not seen the poor marquis three times . ” “ Thanks , thanks , ” said Monte Cristo , <unk> from the steward ’ s utter <unk> that he could not <unk> the <unk> further without danger of breaking it .
“ Give me a light . ” “ Shall I accompany you , monsieur ? ” “ No , it is unnecessary ; Bertuccio will show me a light . ” And Monte Cristo accompanied these words by the gift of two gold pieces , which produced a <unk> of thanks and <unk> from the concierge .
“ Ah , monsieur , ” said he , after having <unk> searched on the <unk> and the <unk> , “ I have not got any candles . ” “ Take one of the <unk> , Bertuccio , ” said the count , “ and show me the apartments . ” The steward obeyed in silence , but it was easy to see , from the manner in which the hand that held the light trembled , how much it cost him to obey .
They went over a tolerably large ground floor ; a first floor consisted of a salon , a <unk> , and two <unk> ; near one of the <unk> they came to a <unk> staircase that led down to the garden .
“ Ah , here is a private staircase , ” said the count ; “ that is convenient .
<unk> me , M. Bertuccio , and go first ; we will see where it leads to . ” “ Monsieur , ” replied Bertuccio , “ it leads to the garden . ” “ And , pray , how do you know that ? ” “ It ought to do so , at least . ” “ Well , let us be sure of that . ” Bertuccio sighed , and went on first ; the stairs did , indeed , lead to the garden .
At the outer door the steward paused .
“ Go on , Monsieur Bertuccio , ” said the count .
But he who was addressed stood there , stupefied , bewildered , <unk> ; his haggard eyes glanced around , as if in search of the traces of some terrible event , and with his clenched hands he seemed <unk> to shut out horrible recollections .
“ Well ! ” insisted the Count .
“ No , no , ” cried Bertuccio , setting down the lantern at the angle of the interior wall .
“ No , monsieur , it is impossible ; I can go no farther . ” “ What does this mean ? ” demanded the irresistible voice of Monte Cristo .
“ Why , you must see , your excellency , ” cried the steward , “ that this is not natural ; that , having a house to purchase , you purchase it exactly at Auteuil , and that , <unk> it at Auteuil , this house should be No .
<unk> , Rue de la <unk> .
Oh , why did I not tell you all ?
I am sure you would not have forced me to come .
I hoped your house would have been some other one than this ; as if there was not another house at Auteuil than that of the <unk> ! ” “ What , what ! ” cried Monte Cristo , stopping suddenly , “ what words do you utter ?
<unk> of a man , Corsican that you are — always mysteries or <unk> .
Come , take the lantern , and let us visit the garden ; you are not afraid of <unk> with me , I hope ? ” Bertuccio raised the lantern , and obeyed .
The door , as it opened , <unk> a gloomy sky , in which the moon strove <unk> to struggle through a sea of clouds that covered her with <unk> of <unk> which she <unk> for an instant , only to sink into obscurity .
The steward wished to turn to the left .
“ No , no , monsieur , ” said Monte Cristo .
“ What is the use of following the <unk> ?
Here is a beautiful lawn ; let us go on straight <unk> . ” Bertuccio wiped the perspiration from his brow , but obeyed ; however , he continued to take the left hand .
Monte Cristo , on the contrary , took the right hand ; arrived near a <unk> of trees , he stopped .
The steward could not restrain himself .
“ <unk> , monsieur — move away , I entreat you ; you are exactly in the spot ! ” “ What spot ? ” “ Where he fell . ” <unk> “ My dear Monsieur Bertuccio , ” said Monte Cristo , laughing , “ <unk> yourself ; we are not at <unk> or at <unk> .
This is not a Corsican _ <unk> _ but an English garden ; badly kept , I own , but still you must not <unk> it for that . ” “ Monsieur , I <unk> you do not stay there ! ” “ I think you are going mad , Bertuccio , ” said the count coldly .
“ If that is the case , I warn you , I shall have you put in a <unk> asylum . ” “ Alas !
excellency , ” returned Bertuccio , <unk> his hands , and shaking his head in a manner that would have excited the count ’ s laughter , had not thoughts of a superior interest occupied him , and rendered him attentive to the least <unk> of this <unk> conscience .
“ Alas !
excellency , the evil has arrived ! ” “ M.
Bertuccio , ” said the count , “ I am very glad to tell you , that while you <unk> , you <unk> your hands and roll your eyes like a man possessed by a devil who will not leave him ; and I have always observed , that the devil most <unk> to be <unk> is a secret .
I knew you were a Corsican .
I knew you were gloomy , and always <unk> over some old history of the <unk> ; and I <unk> that in Italy , because in Italy those things are thought nothing of .
But in France they are considered in very bad taste ; there are gendarmes who occupy themselves with such affairs , judges who <unk> , and <unk> which <unk> . ” Bertuccio clasped his hands , and as , in all these <unk> , he did not let fall the lantern , the light showed his pale and altered countenance .
Monte Cristo examined him with the same look that , at Rome , he had bent upon the execution of Andrea , and then , in a tone that made a shudder pass through the veins of the poor steward — “ The Abbé Busoni , then told me an <unk> , ” said he , “ when , after his journey in France , in <unk> , he sent you to me , with a letter of <unk> , in which he <unk> all your valuable qualities .
Well , I shall write to the abbé ; I shall hold him <unk> for his _ <unk> ’ s _ <unk> , and I shall soon know all about this <unk> .
Only I warn you , that when I <unk> in a country , I <unk> to all its <unk> , and I have no wish to put myself within the <unk> of the French laws for your sake . ” “ Oh , do not do that , excellency ; I have always served you <unk> , ” cried Bertuccio , in despair .
“ I have always been an honest man , and , as far as lay in my power , I have done good . ” “ I do not deny it , ” returned the count ; “ but why are you thus agitated .
It is a bad sign ; a quiet conscience does not occasion such <unk> in the cheeks , and such fever in the hands of a man . ” “ But , your excellency , ” replied Bertuccio <unk> , “ did not the Abbé Busoni , who heard my confession in the prison at <unk> , tell you that I had a heavy burden upon my conscience ? ” “ Yes ; but as he said you would make an excellent steward , I concluded you had stolen — that was all . ” “ Oh , your excellency ! ” returned Bertuccio in deep contempt .
“ Or , as you are a Corsican , that you had been unable to resist the desire of making a ‘ stiff , ’ as you call it . ” “ Yes , my good master , ” cried Bertuccio , casting himself at the count ’ s feet , “ it was simply vengeance — nothing else . ” “ I understand that , but I do not understand what it is that <unk> you in this manner . ” “ But , monsieur , it is very natural , ” returned Bertuccio , “ since it was in this house that my vengeance was accomplished . ” “ What !
my house ? ” “ Oh , your excellency , it was not yours , then . ” “ <unk> , then ?
The Marquis de Saint-Méran , I think , the concierge said .
What had you to revenge on the Marquis de Saint-Méran ? ” “ Oh , it was not on him , monsieur ; it was on another . ” “ This is strange , ” returned Monte Cristo , seeming to yield to his reflections , “ that you should find yourself without any preparation in a house where the event happened that causes you so much remorse . ” “ Monsieur , ” said the steward , “ it is fatality , I am sure .
First , you purchase a house at Auteuil — this house is the one where I have committed an <unk> ; you descend to the garden by the same staircase by which he descended ; you stop at the spot where he received the blow ; and two paces farther is the grave in which he had just buried his child .
This is not chance , for chance , in this case , is too much like Providence . ” “ Well , amiable Corsican , let us suppose it is Providence .
I always suppose anything people please , and , besides , you must <unk> something to <unk> minds .
Come , collect yourself , and tell me all . ” “ I have related it but once , and that was to the Abbé Busoni .
Such things , ” continued Bertuccio , shaking his head , “ are only related under the <unk> of confession . ” “ Then , ” said the count , “ I <unk> you to your <unk> .
<unk> <unk> or <unk> , and relate your secrets , but , as for me , I do not like anyone who is alarmed by such <unk> , and I do not choose that my servants should be afraid to walk in the garden of an evening .
I confess I am not very desirous of a visit from the <unk> of police , for , in Italy , justice is only paid when silent — in France she is paid only when she speaks .
_ <unk> ! _ I thought you somewhat Corsican , a great deal <unk> , and an excellent steward ; but I see you have other <unk> to your bow .
You are no longer in my service , Monsieur Bertuccio . ” “ Oh , your excellency , your excellency ! ” cried the steward , struck with terror at this <unk> , “ if that is the only reason I cannot remain in your service , I will tell all , for if I quit you , it will only be to go to the scaffold . ” “ That is different , ” replied Monte Cristo ; “ but if you intend to tell an <unk> , reflect it were better not to speak at all . ” “ No , monsieur , I swear to you , by my hopes of <unk> , I will tell you all , for the Abbé Busoni himself only knew a part of my secret ; but , I pray you , go away from that <unk> .
The moon is just <unk> through the clouds , and there , standing where you do , and wrapped in that cloak that <unk> your figure , you remind me of M. de Villefort . ” “ What ! ” cried Monte Cristo , “ it was M. de Villefort ? ” “ Your excellency knows him ? ” “ The former royal attorney at <unk> ? ” “ Yes . ” “ Who married the Marquis of Saint-Méran ’ s daughter ? ” “ Yes . ” “ Who enjoyed the reputation of being the most severe , the most upright , the most <unk> magistrate on the bench ? ” “ Well , monsieur , ” said Bertuccio , “ this man with this <unk> reputation — — ” “ Well ? ” “ Was a <unk> . ” “ Bah , ” replied Monte Cristo , “ impossible ! ” “ It is as I tell you . ” “ Ah , really , ” said Monte Cristo .
“ Have you proof of this ? ” “ I had it . ” “ And you have lost it ; how stupid ! ” “ Yes ; but by careful search it might be recovered . ” “ Really , ” returned the count , “ relate it to me , for it begins to interest me . ” And the count , <unk> an air from _ <unk> _ , went to sit down on a bench , while Bertuccio followed him , collecting his thoughts .
Bertuccio remained standing before him .
<unk> Chapter <unk> .
The <unk> At what point shall I begin my story , your excellency ? ” asked Bertuccio .
“ Where you please , ” returned Monte Cristo , “ since I know nothing at all of it . ” “ I thought the Abbé Busoni had told your excellency . ” “ Some particulars , doubtless , but that is seven or eight years ago , and I have forgotten them . ” “ Then I can speak without fear of <unk> your excellency . ” “ Go on , M. Bertuccio ; you will supply the want of the evening papers . ” “ The story begins in 1815 . ” “ Ah , ” said Monte Cristo , “ 1815 is not yesterday . ” “ No , monsieur , and yet I recollect all things as clearly as if they had happened but then .
I had a brother , an elder brother , who was in the service of the emperor ; he had become <unk> in a regiment composed entirely of <unk> .
This brother was my only friend ; we became <unk> — I at five , he at eighteen .
He brought me up as if I had been his son , and in <unk> he married .
When the emperor returned from the Island of Elba , my brother instantly joined the army , was slightly wounded at Waterloo , and retired with the army beyond the <unk> . ” “ But that is the history of the <unk> <unk> , M. Bertuccio , ” said the count ; “ unless I am mistaken , it has been already written . ” “ Excuse me , excellency , but these details are necessary , and you promised to be patient . ” “ Go on ; I will keep my word . ” “ One day we received a letter .
I should tell you that we lived in the little village of <unk> , at the extremity of <unk> <unk> .
This letter was from my brother .
He told us that the army was <unk> , and that he should return by <unk> , <unk> , Le <unk> , and <unk> ; and , if I had any money , he <unk> me to leave it for him at <unk> , with an innkeeper with whom I had <unk> . ” “ In the <unk> line ? ” said Monte Cristo .
“ <unk> , your excellency ?
<unk> must live . ” “ Certainly ; go on . ” “ I loved my brother tenderly , as I told your excellency , and I resolved not to send the money , but to take it to him myself .
I possessed a thousand francs .
I left five hundred with <unk> , my <unk> , and with the other five hundred I set off for <unk> .
It was easy to do so , and as I had my boat and a <unk> to take in at sea , everything <unk> my project .
But , after we had taken in our <unk> , the wind became contrary , so that we were four or five days without being able to enter the <unk> .
At last , however , we succeeded , and worked up to <unk> .
I left the boat between <unk> and <unk> , and took the road to <unk> . ” “ We are getting to the story now ? ” “ Yes , your excellency ; excuse me , but , as you will see , I only tell you what is absolutely necessary .
Just at this time the famous <unk> took place in the south of France .
Three <unk> , called <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> assassinated everybody whom they suspected of <unk> .
You have doubtless heard of these <unk> , your excellency ? ” “ <unk> ; I was far from France at that period .
Go on . ” “ As I entered <unk> , I <unk> <unk> in blood ; at every step you encountered dead bodies and <unk> of <unk> , who killed , <unk> , and burned .
At the sight of this <unk> and <unk> I became terrified , not for myself — for I , a simple Corsican <unk> , had nothing to fear ; on the contrary , that time was most favorable for us smugglers — but for my brother , a soldier of the <unk> , returning from the army of the <unk> , with his uniform and his <unk> , there was everything to <unk> .
I hastened to the innkeeper .
My <unk> had been but too true .
My brother had arrived the previous evening at <unk> , and , at the very door of the house where he was about to demand hospitality , he had been assassinated .
I did all in my power to discover the <unk> , but no one <unk> tell me their names , so much were they dreaded .
I then thought of that French justice of which I had heard so much , and which feared nothing , and I went to the king ’ s attorney . ” “ And this king ’ s attorney was named Villefort ? ” asked Monte Cristo <unk> .
“ Yes , your excellency ; he came from Marseilles , where he had been deputy procureur .
His <unk> had procured him <unk> , and he was said to be one of the first who had informed the government of the departure from the Island of Elba . ” “ Then , ” said Monte Cristo “ you went to him ? ” “ ‘ Monsieur , ’ I said , ‘ my brother was assassinated yesterday in the streets of <unk> , I know not by whom , but it is your duty to find out .
You are the <unk> of justice here , and it is for justice to <unk> those she has been unable to protect . ’ “ ‘ Who was your brother ? ’ asked he .
“ ‘ A <unk> in the Corsican <unk> . ’ “ ‘ A soldier of the usurper , then ? ’ “ ‘ A soldier of the French army . ’ “ ‘ Well , ’ replied he , ‘ he has <unk> with the sword , and he has <unk> by the sword . ’ “ ‘ You are mistaken , monsieur , ’ I replied ; ‘ he has <unk> by the <unk> . ’ “ ‘ What do you want me to do ? ’ asked the magistrate .
“ ‘ I have already told you — <unk> him . ’ “ ‘ On whom ? ’ “ ‘ On his <unk> . ’ “ ‘ How should I know who they are ? ’ “ ‘ <unk> them to be sought for . ’ “ ‘ Why , your brother has been <unk> in a quarrel , and killed in a duel .
All these old soldiers commit <unk> which were <unk> in the time of the emperor , but which are not suffered now , for the people here do not like soldiers of such <unk> conduct . ’ “ ‘ Monsieur , ’ I replied , ‘ it is not for myself that I entreat your interference — I should <unk> for him or <unk> him , but my poor brother had a wife , and were anything to happen to me , the poor creature would <unk> from want , for my brother ’ s pay alone kept her .
Pray , try and obtain a small government <unk> for her . ’ “ ‘ Every revolution has its <unk> , ’ returned M. de Villefort ; ‘ your brother has been the victim of this .
It is a misfortune , and government <unk> nothing to his family .
If we are to judge by all the vengeance that the <unk> of the usurper exercised on the <unk> of the king , when , in their turn , they were in power , your brother would be today , in all probability , condemned to death .
What has happened is quite natural , and in <unk> with the law of <unk> . ’ “ ‘ What , ’ cried I , ‘ do you , a magistrate , speak thus to me ? ’ “ ‘ All these <unk> are mad , on my honor , ’ replied M. de Villefort ; ‘ they fancy that their <unk> is still emperor .
You have mistaken the time , you should have told me this two months ago , it is too late now .
Go now , at once , or I shall have you put out . ’ “ I looked at him an instant to see if there was anything to hope from further <unk> .
But he was a man of stone .
I approached him , and said in a low voice , ‘ Well , since you know the <unk> so well , you know that they always keep their word .
You think that it was a good deed to kill my brother , who was a Bonapartist , because you are a <unk> .
Well , I , who am a Bonapartist also , declare one thing to you , which is , that I will kill you .
From this moment I declare the <unk> against you , so protect yourself as well as you can , for the next time we meet your last hour has come . ’ And before he had recovered from his surprise , I opened the door and left the room . ” “ Well , well , ” said Monte Cristo , “ such an innocent looking person as you are to do those things , M. Bertuccio , and to a king ’ s attorney at that !
But did he know what was meant by the terrible word ‘ <unk> ’ ? ” “ He knew so well , that from that moment he shut himself in his house , and never went out <unk> , seeking me high and low .
Fortunately , I was so well concealed that he could not find me .
Then he became alarmed , and dared not stay any longer at <unk> , so he <unk> a change of residence , and , as he was in reality very <unk> , he was <unk> to <unk> .
But , as you know , a Corsican who has <unk> to <unk> himself cares not for distance , so his carriage , fast as it went , was never above half a day ’ s journey before me , who followed him on foot .
The most important thing was , not to kill him only — for I had an opportunity of doing so a hundred times — but to kill him without being discovered — at least , without being arrested .
I no longer belonged to myself , for I had my <unk> to protect and provide for .
“ For three months I watched M. de Villefort , for three months he took not a step <unk> without my following him .
At length I discovered that he went <unk> to Auteuil .
I followed him thither , and I saw him enter the house where we now are , only , instead of entering by the great door that looks into the street , he came on horseback , or in his carriage , left the one or the other at the little inn , and entered by the gate you see there . ” Monte Cristo made a sign with his head to show that he could <unk> in the darkness the door to which Bertuccio <unk> .
“ As I had nothing more to do at <unk> , I went to Auteuil , and gained all the information I could .
If I wished to surprise him , it was evident this was the spot to lie in wait for him .
The house belonged , as the concierge informed your excellency , to M. de Saint-Méran , Villefort ’ s <unk> .
M. de Saint-Méran lived at Marseilles , so that this country house was useless to him , and it was reported to be let to a young widow , known only by the name of ‘ the <unk> . ’ “ One evening , as I was looking over the wall , I saw a young and handsome woman who was walking alone in that garden , which was not <unk> by any windows , and I guessed that she was awaiting M. de Villefort .
When she was sufficiently near for me to distinguish her features , I saw she was from eighteen to nineteen , tall and very fair .
As she had a loose <unk> dress on and as nothing concealed her figure , I saw she would ere long become a mother .
A few moments after , the little door was opened and a man entered .
The young woman hastened to meet him .
They threw themselves into each other ’ s arms , embraced tenderly , and returned together to the house .
The man was M. de Villefort ; I fully believed that when he went out in the night he would be forced to traverse the whole of the garden alone . ” <unk> “ And , ” asked the count , “ did you ever know the name of this woman ? ” “ No , excellency , ” returned Bertuccio ; “ you will see that I had no time to learn it . ” “ Go on . ” “ That evening , ” continued Bertuccio , “ I could have killed the procureur , but as I was not sufficiently acquainted with the neighborhood , I was fearful of not <unk> him on the spot , and that if his cries were <unk> I might be taken ; so I put it off until the next occasion , and in order that nothing should escape me , I took a chamber looking into the street bordered by the wall of the garden .
Three days after , about seven o ’ clock in the evening , I saw a servant on horseback leave the house at full <unk> , and take the road to <unk> .
I concluded that he was going to <unk> , and I was not deceived .
Three hours later , the man returned covered with dust , his <unk> was performed , and two minutes after , another man on foot , <unk> in a mantle , opened the little door of the garden , which he closed after him .
I descended rapidly ; although I had not seen Villefort ’ s face , I recognized him by the beating of my heart .
I crossed the street , and stopped at a post placed at the angle of the wall , and by means of which I had once before looked into the garden .
“ This time I did not content myself with looking , but I took my knife out of my pocket , felt that the point was sharp , and sprang over the wall .
My first care was to run to the door ; he had left the key in it , taking the simple precaution of turning it twice in the lock .
Nothing , then , <unk> my escape by this means , I examined the grounds .
The garden was long and narrow ; a <unk> of smooth <unk> extended down the middle , and at the corners were <unk> of trees with thick and <unk> <unk> , that made a background for the <unk> and flowers .
In order to go from the door to the house , or from the house to the door , M. de Villefort would be obliged to pass by one of these <unk> of trees .
<unk> “ It was the end of September ; the wind blew violently .
The faint <unk> of the pale moon , hidden <unk> by masses of dark clouds that were <unk> across the sky , <unk> the <unk> walks that led to the house , but were unable to <unk> the obscurity of the thick <unk> , in which a man could conceal himself without any fear of discovery .
I hid myself in the one nearest to the path Villefort must take , and scarcely was I there when , <unk> the <unk> of wind , I fancied I heard <unk> ; but you know , or rather you do not know , your excellency , that he who is about to commit an <unk> fancies that he hears low cries <unk> <unk> in his ears .
Two hours passed thus , during which I imagined I heard <unk> <unk> .
<unk> struck .
As the last stroke died away , I saw a faint light <unk> through the windows of the private staircase by which we have just descended .
The door opened , and the man in the mantle reappeared .
“ The terrible moment had come , but I had so long been prepared for it that my heart did not fail in the least .
I drew my knife from my pocket again , opened it , and made ready to strike .
The man in the mantle advanced towards me , but as he drew near I saw that he had a weapon in his hand .
I was afraid , not of a struggle , but of a failure .
When he was only a few paces from me , I saw that what I had taken for a weapon was only a <unk> .
I was still unable to divine for what reason M. de Villefort had this <unk> in his hands , when he stopped close to the thicket where I was , glanced round , and began to <unk> a hole in the earth .
I then perceived that he was <unk> something under his mantle , which he laid on the grass in order to <unk> more freely .
Then , I confess , curiosity mingled with hatred ; I wished to see what Villefort was going to do there , and I remained motionless , holding my breath .
Then an idea crossed my mind , which was confirmed when I saw the procureur lift from under his mantle a box , two feet long , and six or eight inches deep .
I let him place the box in the hole he had made , then , while he stamped with his feet to remove all traces of his occupation , I rushed on him and plunged my knife into his breast , <unk> : “ ‘ I am <unk> Bertuccio ; thy death for my brother ’ s ; thy treasure for his widow ; thou <unk> that my vengeance is more complete than I had hoped . ’ “ I know not if he heard these words ; I think he did not , for he fell without a cry .
I felt his blood <unk> over my face , but I was intoxicated , I was <unk> , and the blood <unk> , instead of burning me .
In a second I had <unk> the box ; then , that it might not be known I had done so , I filled up the hole , threw the <unk> over the wall , and rushed through the door , which I <unk> , carrying off the key . ” “ Ah , ” said Monte Cristo “ it seems to me this was nothing but murder and <unk> . ” “ No , your excellency , ” returned Bertuccio ; “ it was a <unk> followed by <unk> . ” “ And was the sum a large one ? ” “ It was not money . ” “ Ah , I recollect , ” replied the count ; “ did you not say something of an infant ? ” “ Yes , excellency ; I hastened to the river , sat down on the bank , and with my knife forced open the lock of the box .
In a fine linen cloth was wrapped a <unk> child .
Its purple visage , and its <unk> hands showed that it had <unk> from <unk> , but as it was not yet cold , I hesitated to throw it into the water that ran at my feet .
After a moment I fancied that I felt a slight <unk> of the heart , and as I had been <unk> at the hospital at <unk> , I did what a doctor would have done — I <unk> the <unk> by blowing air into them , and at the expiration of a quarter of an hour , it began to breathe , and cried <unk> .
In my turn I uttered a cry , but a cry of joy .
“ ‘ God has not cursed me then , ’ I cried , ‘ since he <unk> me to save the life of a human creature , in exchange for the life I have taken away . ’ ” <unk> “ And what did you do with the child ? ” asked Monte Cristo .
“ It was an <unk> <unk> for a man seeking to escape . ” “ I had not for a moment the idea of keeping it , but I knew that at Paris there was an asylum where they receive such creatures .
As I passed the city gates I declared that I had found the child on the road , and I inquired where the asylum was ; the box confirmed my statement , the linen proved that the infant belonged to wealthy parents , the blood with which I was covered might have proceeded from the child as well as from anyone else .
No objection was raised , but they pointed out the asylum , which was situated at the upper end of the Rue d ’ <unk> , and after having taken the precaution of cutting the linen in two pieces , so that one of the two letters which marked it was on the piece wrapped around the child , while the other remained in my possession , I rang the bell , and fled with all speed .
A fortnight after I was at <unk> , and I said to <unk> : “ ‘ <unk> <unk> , sister ; <unk> is dead , but he is <unk> . ’ “ She demanded what I meant , and when I had told her all , — ‘ <unk> , ’ said she , ‘ you should have brought this child with you ; we would have replaced the parents it has lost , have called it Benedetto , and then , in consequence of this good action , God would have blessed us . ’ In reply I gave her the half of the linen I had kept in order to <unk> him if we became rich . ” “ What letters were marked on the linen ? ” said Monte Cristo .
“ An <unk> and an <unk> , surmounted by a baron ’ s <unk> . ” “ By heaven , M. Bertuccio , you make use of <unk> terms ; where did you study <unk> ? ” “ In your service , excellency , where everything is learned . ” “ Go on , I am curious to know two things . ” “ What are they , your excellency ? ” “ What became of this little boy ?
for I think you told me it was a boy , M. Bertuccio . ” “ No excellency , I do not recollect telling you that . ” “ I thought you did ; I must have been mistaken . ” “ No , you were not , for it was in reality a little boy .
But your excellency wished to know two things ; what was the second ? ” “ The second was the crime of which you were accused when you asked for a <unk> , and the Abbé Busoni came to visit you at your request in the prison at <unk> . ” “ The story will be very long , excellency . ” “ What matter ?
you know I take but little sleep , and I do not suppose you are very much inclined for it either . ” Bertuccio bowed , and resumed his story .
“ <unk> to <unk> the recollections of the past that <unk> me , partly to supply the wants of the poor widow , I eagerly returned to my trade of <unk> , which had become more easy since that <unk> of the laws which always follows a revolution .
The <unk> <unk> were <unk> in particular , in consequence of the <unk> that were <unk> breaking out in <unk> , <unk> , or <unk> .
We <unk> by this <unk> on the part of the government to make friends everywhere .
Since my brother ’ s <unk> in the streets of <unk> , I had never entered the town ; the result was that the innkeeper with whom we were connected , seeing that we would no longer come to him , was forced to come to us , and had established a branch to his inn , on the road from <unk> to <unk> , at the sign of the Pont du <unk> .
We had thus , at <unk> , <unk> , or <unk> , a dozen places where we left our <unk> , and where , in case of necessity , we concealed ourselves from the gendarmes and <unk> officers .
<unk> is a <unk> trade , when a certain degree of <unk> and intelligence is employed ; as for myself , brought up in the mountains , I had a double motive for fearing the gendarmes and <unk> officers , as my appearance before the judges would cause an inquiry , and an inquiry always looks back into the past .
And in my past life they might find something far more grave than the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , or <unk> of brandy without a permit .
So , <unk> death to <unk> , I accomplished the most astonishing deeds , and which , more than once , showed me that the too great care we take of our bodies is the only obstacle to the success of those projects which require rapid decision , and <unk> and determined execution .
In reality , when you have once devoted your life to your <unk> , you are no longer the equal of other men , or , rather , other men are no longer your <unk> , and <unk> has taken this resolution , feels his strength and resources <unk> . ” “ <unk> , M. Bertuccio , ” interrupted the count ; “ you have done a little of everything in your life . ” “ Oh , excellency ! ” “ No , no ; but philosophy at half-past ten at night is somewhat late ; yet I have no other observation to make , for what you say is correct , which is more than can be said for all philosophy . ” “ My <unk> became more and more <unk> and more <unk> .
<unk> took care of all , and our little fortune increased .
One day as I was setting off on an <unk> , ‘ Go , ’ said she ; ‘ at your return I will give you a surprise . ’ I questioned her , but in vain ; she would tell me nothing , and I departed .
Our <unk> lasted nearly six weeks ; we had been to <unk> to take in <unk> , to Leghorn for English <unk> , and we ran our <unk> without opposition , and returned home full of joy .
When I entered the house , the first thing I beheld in the middle of <unk> ’ s chamber was a <unk> that might be called <unk> compared with the rest of the furniture , and in it a <unk> seven or eight months old .
I uttered a cry of joy ; the only moments of sadness I had known since the <unk> of the procureur were caused by the recollection that I had abandoned this child .
For the <unk> itself I had never felt any remorse .
Poor <unk> had guessed all .
She had <unk> by my absence , and furnished with the half of the linen , and having written down the day and hour at which I had deposited the child at the asylum , had set off for Paris , and had <unk> it .
No objection was raised , and the infant was given up to her .
Ah , I confess , your excellency , when I saw this poor creature sleeping <unk> in its <unk> , I felt my eyes filled with tears .
‘ Ah , <unk> , ’ cried I , ‘ you are an excellent woman , and Heaven will bless you . ’ ” “ This , ” said Monte Cristo , “ is less correct than your philosophy , — it is only faith . ” “ Alas , your excellency is right , ” replied Bertuccio , “ and God made this infant the instrument of our punishment .
Never did a <unk> nature declare itself more <unk> , and yet it was not owing to any fault in his bringing up .
He was a most lovely child , with large blue eyes , of that deep color that <unk> so well with the <unk> complexion ; only his hair , which was too light , gave his face a most singular expression , and added to the <unk> of his look , and the <unk> of his smile .
“ <unk> , there is a <unk> which says that ‘ red is either altogether good or altogether bad . ’ The <unk> was but too correct as regarded Benedetto , and even in his <unk> he manifested the worst disposition .
It is true that the indulgence of his <unk> encouraged him .
This child , for whom my poor sister would go to the town , five or six leagues off , to purchase the <unk> <unk> and the most <unk> <unk> , preferred to <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> , the <unk> stolen from a neighbor ’ s <unk> , or the dried apples in his <unk> , when he could eat as well of the <unk> and apples that grew in my garden .
“ One day , when Benedetto was about five or six , our neighbor <unk> , who , according to the custom of the country , never locked up his purse or his <unk> — for , as your excellency knows , there are no thieves in Corsica — <unk> that he had lost a louis out of his purse ; we thought he must have made a mistake in <unk> his money , but he <unk> in the <unk> of his statement .
One day , Benedetto , who had been gone from the house since morning , to our great anxiety , did not return until late in the evening , dragging a <unk> after him , which he said he had found <unk> to the foot of a tree .
For more than a month past , the <unk> child , who knew not what to wish for , had taken it into his head to have a <unk> .
A <unk> , who had passed by <unk> , and who had several of these animals , whose <unk> had greatly <unk> him , had , doubtless , suggested this idea to him .
‘ <unk> are not found in our woods <unk> to trees , ’ said I ; ‘ confess how you obtained this animal . ’ Benedetto <unk> the truth of what he had said , and accompanied it with details that did more honor to his imagination than to his <unk> .
I became angry ; he began to laugh , I threatened to strike him , and he made two steps <unk> .
‘ You cannot beat me , ’ said he ; ‘ you have no right , for you are not my father . ’ <unk> “ We never knew who had revealed this fatal secret , which we had so carefully concealed from him ; however , it was this answer , in which the child ’ s whole character revealed itself , that almost terrified me , and my arm fell without touching him .
“ The boy <unk> , and this victory rendered him so <unk> , that all the money of <unk> , whose affection for him seemed to increase as he became more unworthy of it , was spent in <unk> she knew not how to <unk> against , and <unk> she had not the courage to prevent .
When I was at <unk> everything went on properly , but no sooner was my back turned than Benedetto became master , and everything went ill .
When he was only eleven , he chose his companions from among the young men of eighteen or twenty , the worst characters in <unk> , or , indeed , in Corsica , and they had already , for some <unk> <unk> , been several times threatened with a <unk> .
I became alarmed , as any <unk> might be attended with serious <unk> .
I was compelled , at this period , to leave Corsica on an important <unk> ; I reflected for a long time , and with the hope of <unk> some <unk> misfortune , I resolved that Benedetto should accompany me .
“ I hoped that the active and <unk> life of a <unk> , with the severe <unk> on board , would have a <unk> effect on his character , which was now <unk> , if not quite , <unk> .
I spoke to Benedetto alone , and proposed to him to accompany me , endeavoring to <unk> him by all the promises most likely to <unk> the imagination of a child of twelve .
He heard me <unk> , and when I had finished , burst out laughing .
“ ‘ Are you mad , uncle ? ’ ( he called me by this name when he was in good <unk> ) ; ‘ do you think I am going to change the life I lead for your mode of existence — my agreeable <unk> for the hard and <unk> toil you <unk> on yourself , exposed to the bitter <unk> at night , and the <unk> heat by day , compelled to conceal yourself , and when you are perceived , receive a <unk> of bullets , all to earn a <unk> sum ?
Why , I have as much money as I want ; mother <unk> always <unk> me when I ask for it !
You see that I should be a fool to accept your offer . ’ “ The <unk> , and his <unk> , perfectly stupefied me .
Benedetto <unk> his <unk> , and I saw him from a distance point me out to them as a fool . ” “ <unk> child , ” murmured Monte Cristo .
“ Oh , had he been my own son , ” replied Bertuccio , “ or even my nephew , I would have brought him back to the right road , for the knowledge that you are doing your duty gives you strength , but the idea that I was striking a child whose father I had killed , made it impossible for me to <unk> him .
I gave my sister , who constantly <unk> the unfortunate boy , good advice , and as she confessed that she had several times missed money to a considerable amount , I showed her a safe place in which to conceal our little treasure for the future .
My mind was already made up .
Benedetto could read , write , and <unk> perfectly , for when the fit seized him , he learned more in a day than others in a week .
My intention was to enter him as a clerk in some ship , and without letting him know anything of my plan , to convey him some morning on board ; by this means his future treatment would depend upon his own conduct .
I set off for France , after having fixed upon the plan .
Our <unk> was to be landed in the <unk> of <unk> , and this was a difficult thing to do because it was then the year <unk> .
The most perfect tranquillity was restored , and the <unk> of the <unk> officers was redoubled , and their <unk> was increased at this time , in consequence of the fair at <unk> .
<unk> “ Our <unk> made a favorable beginning .
We <unk> our vessel — which had a double hold , where our <unk> were concealed — <unk> a number of other <unk> that bordered the banks of the <unk> from <unk> to <unk> .
On our arrival we began to discharge our <unk> in the night , and to convey it into the town , by the help of the innkeeper with whom we were connected .
“ Whether success rendered us imprudent , or whether we were betrayed , I know not ; but one evening , about five o ’ clock , our little <unk> came <unk> , to inform us that he had seen a <unk> of <unk> officers advancing in our direction .
It was not their <unk> that alarmed us , for <unk> were constantly <unk> along the banks of the <unk> , but the care , according to the boy ’ s account , that they took to avoid being seen .
In an instant we were on the <unk> , but it was too late ; our vessel was surrounded , and amongst the <unk> officers I observed several gendarmes , and , as terrified at the sight of their <unk> as I was brave at the sight of any other , I sprang into the hold , opened a port , and dropped into the river , <unk> , and only rose at intervals to breathe , until I reached a <unk> that had recently been made from the <unk> to the <unk> that runs from <unk> to <unk> .
I was now safe , for I could <unk> along the <unk> without being seen , and I reached the <unk> in safety .
I had <unk> taken this direction .
I have already told your excellency of an innkeeper from <unk> who had set up a little tavern on the road from <unk> to <unk> . ” “ Yes , ” said Monte Cristo “ I perfectly recollect him ; I think he was your <unk> . ” “ <unk> , ” answered Bertuccio ; “ but he had , seven or eight years before this period , sold his establishment to a <unk> at Marseilles , who , having almost ruined himself in his old trade , wished to make his fortune in another .
Of course , we made the same arrangements with the new landlord that we had with the old ; and it was of this man that I intended to ask shelter . ” “ What was his name ? ” inquired the count , who seemed to become somewhat interested in Bertuccio ’ s story .
“ <unk> Caderousse ; he had married a woman from the village of Carconte , and whom we did not know by any other name than that of her village .
She was suffering from <unk> fever , and seemed dying by inches .
As for her husband , he was a <unk> fellow of forty , or <unk> , who had more than once , in time of danger , given <unk> proof of his presence of mind and courage . ” “ And you say , ” interrupted Monte Cristo “ that this took place towards the year — — ” “ <unk> , your excellency . ” “ In what month ? ” “ June . ” “ The beginning or the end ? ” “ The evening of the <unk> . ” <unk> “ Ah , ” said Monte Cristo “ the evening of the <unk> of June , <unk> .
Go on . ” “ It was from Caderousse that I intended <unk> shelter , and , as we never entered by the door that opened <unk> the road , I resolved not to break through the rule , so <unk> over the <unk> , I crept amongst the <unk> and wild <unk> trees , and fearing that Caderousse might have some guest , I entered a kind of shed in which I had often passed the night , and which was only separated from the inn by a <unk> , in which holes had been made in order to <unk> us to watch an opportunity of <unk> our presence .
“ My intention was , if Caderousse was alone , to <unk> him with my presence , finish the <unk> the <unk> officers had interrupted , and profit by the threatened storm to return to the <unk> , and ascertain the state of our vessel and its crew .
I stepped into the shed , and it was fortunate I did so , for at that moment Caderousse entered with a stranger .
“ I waited <unk> , not to <unk> what they said , but because I could do nothing else ; besides , the same thing had occurred often before .
The man who was with Caderousse was evidently a stranger to the South of France ; he was one of those <unk> who come to sell <unk> at the <unk> fair , and who during the month the fair <unk> , and during which there is so great an <unk> of <unk> and <unk> from all parts of Europe , often have <unk> to the amount of <unk> to <unk> francs .
Caderousse entered hastily .
Then , seeing that the room was , as usual , empty , and only guarded by the dog , he called to his wife , ‘ <unk> , Carconte , ’ said he , ‘ the worthy priest has not deceived us ; the diamond is real . ’ “ An exclamation of joy was heard , and the staircase <unk> beneath a feeble step .
‘ What do you say ? ’ asked his wife , pale as death .
“ ‘ I say that the diamond is real , and that this gentleman , one of the first <unk> of Paris , will give us <unk> francs for it .
Only , in order to satisfy himself that it really belongs to us , he wishes you to relate to him , as I have done already , the <unk> manner in which the diamond came into our possession .
In the meantime please to sit down , monsieur , and I will fetch you some <unk> . ’ “ The jeweller examined attentively the interior of the inn and the apparent poverty of the persons who were about to sell him a diamond that seemed to have come from the <unk> of a prince .
“ ‘ <unk> your story , madame , ’ said he , wishing , no doubt , to profit by the absence of the husband , so that the latter could not influence the wife ’ s story , to see if the two <unk> <unk> .
“ ‘ Oh , ’ returned she , ‘ it was a gift of heaven .
My husband was a great friend , in <unk> or 1815 , of a sailor named Edmond Dantès .
This poor fellow , whom Caderousse had forgotten , had not forgotten him , and at his death he <unk> this diamond to him . ’ “ ‘ But how did he obtain it ? ’ asked the jeweller ; ‘ had he it before he was <unk> ? ’ “ ‘ No , monsieur ; but it appears that in prison he made the acquaintance of a rich Englishman , and as in prison he fell sick , and Dantès took the same care of him as if he had been his brother , the Englishman , when he was set free , gave this stone to Dantès , who , less fortunate , died , and , in his turn , left it to us , and charged the excellent abbé , who was here this morning , to deliver it . ’ “ ‘ The same story , ’ muttered the jeweller ; ‘ and <unk> as it seemed at first , it may be true .
There ’ s only the price we are not agreed about . ’ “ ‘ How not agreed about ? ’ said Caderousse .
‘ I thought we agreed for the price I asked . ’ “ ‘ That is , ’ replied the jeweller , ‘ I offered <unk> francs . ’ ‘ <unk> thousand , ’ cried La Carconte ; ‘ we will not part with it for that sum .
The abbé told us it was worth <unk> without the setting . ’ “ ‘ What was the abbé ’ s name ? ’ asked the <unk> <unk> .
“ ‘ The Abbé Busoni , ’ said La Carconte .
“ ‘ He was a <unk> ? ’ “ ‘ An Italian from the neighborhood of <unk> , I believe . ’ “ ‘ Let me see this diamond again , ’ replied the jeweller ; ‘ the first time you are often mistaken as to the value of a stone . ’ “ Caderousse took from his pocket a small case of black <unk> , opened , and gave it to the jeweller .
At the sight of the diamond , which was as large as a <unk> , La Carconte ’ s eyes <unk> with <unk> . ” “ And what did you think of this fine story , <unk> ? ” said Monte Cristo ; “ did you credit it ? ” “ Yes , your excellency .
I did not look on Caderousse as a bad man , and I thought him incapable of <unk> a crime , or even a theft . ” “ That did more honor to your heart than to your experience , M. Bertuccio .
Had you known this Edmond Dantès , of whom they spoke ? ” “ No , your excellency , I had never heard of him before , and never but once afterwards , and that was from the Abbé Busoni himself , when I saw him in the prison at <unk> . ” “ Go on . ” “ The jeweller took the ring , and drawing from his pocket a pair of steel <unk> and a small set of <unk> <unk> , he took the stone out of its setting , and weighed it carefully .
“ ‘ I will give you <unk> , ’ said he , ‘ but not a sou more ; besides , as that is the exact value of the stone , I brought just that sum with me . ’ “ ‘ Oh , that ’ s no matter , ’ replied Caderousse , ‘ I will go back with you to fetch the other <unk> francs . ’ “ ‘ No , ’ returned the jeweller , giving back the diamond and the ring to Caderousse , ‘ no , it is worth no more , and I am sorry I offered so much , for the stone has a <unk> in it , which I had not seen .
However , I will not go back on my word , and I will give <unk> . ’ “ ‘ At least , replace the diamond in the ring , ’ said La Carconte <unk> .
“ ‘ Ah , true , ’ replied the jeweller , and he <unk> the stone .
“ ‘ No matter , ’ observed Caderousse , <unk> the box in his pocket , ‘ someone else will purchase it . ’ “ ‘ Yes , ’ continued the jeweller ; ‘ but someone else will not be so easy as I am , or content himself with the same story .
It is not natural that a man like you should possess such a diamond .
He will inform against you .
You will have to find the Abbé Busoni ; and <unk> who give diamonds worth two thousand louis are rare .
The law would seize it , and put you in prison ; if at the end of three or four months you are set at liberty , the ring will be lost , or a false stone , worth three francs , will be given you , instead of a diamond worth <unk> or perhaps <unk> francs ; from which you must allow that one runs considerable risk in <unk> . ’ “ Caderousse and his wife looked eagerly at each other .
“ ‘ No , ’ said Caderousse , ‘ we are not rich enough to lose <unk> francs . ’ “ ‘ As you please , my dear sir , ’ said the jeweller ; ‘ I had , however , as you see , brought you the money in bright coin . ’ And he drew from his pocket a handful of gold , and held it sparkling before the dazzled eyes of the innkeeper , and in the other hand he held a packet of bank-notes .
“ There was evidently a severe struggle in the mind of Caderousse ; it was plain that the small <unk> case , which he turned over and over in his hand , did not seem to him <unk> in value to the enormous sum which <unk> his gaze .
He turned towards his wife .
“ ‘ What do you think of this ? ’ he asked in a low voice .
“ ‘ Let him have it — let him have it , ’ she said .
‘ If he returns to <unk> without the diamond , he will inform against us , and , as he says , who knows if we shall ever again see the Abbé Busoni ? — in all probability we shall never see him . ’ “ ‘ Well , then , so I will ! ’ said Caderousse ; ‘ so you may have the diamond for <unk> francs .
But my wife wants a gold chain , and I want a pair of silver <unk> . ’ “ The jeweller drew from his pocket a long flat box , which contained several <unk> of the <unk> demanded .
‘ Here , ’ he said , ‘ I am very <unk> in my <unk> — take your choice . ’ “ The woman selected a gold chain worth about five louis , and the husband a pair of <unk> , worth perhaps fifteen francs .
“ ‘ I hope you will not complain now ? ’ said the jeweller .
“ ‘ The abbé told me it was worth <unk> francs , ’ muttered Caderousse .
“ ‘ Come , come — give it to me !
What a strange fellow you are , ’ said the jeweller , taking the diamond from his hand .
‘ I give you <unk> francs — that is , <unk> livres of income , — a fortune such as I wish I had myself , and you are not satisfied ! ’ “ ‘ And the <unk> thousand francs , ’ inquired Caderousse in a hoarse voice , ‘ where are they ?
Come — let us see them . ’ “ ‘ Here they are , ’ replied the jeweller , and he counted out upon the table <unk> francs in gold , and <unk> francs in bank-notes .
“ ‘ Wait whilst I light the lamp , ’ said La Carconte ; ‘ it is growing dark , and there may be some mistake . ’ In fact , night had come on during this conversation , and with night the storm which had been threatening for the last <unk> .
The thunder <unk> in the distance ; but it was apparently not heard by the jeweller , Caderousse , or La Carconte , absorbed as they were all three with the <unk> of gain .
I myself felt a strange kind of <unk> at the sight of all this gold and all these bank-notes ; it seemed to me that I was in a dream , and , as it always happens in a dream , I felt myself <unk> to the spot .
Caderousse counted and again counted the gold and the notes , then handed them to his wife , who counted and counted them again in her turn .
During this time , the jeweller made the diamond play and <unk> in the <unk> , and the <unk> threw out <unk> of light which made him <unk> of those which — <unk> of the storm — began to play in at the windows .
“ ‘ Well , ’ inquired the jeweller , ‘ is the <unk> all right ? ’ “ ‘ Yes , ’ said Caderousse .
‘ Give me the pocket-book , La Carconte , and find a bag somewhere . ’ “ La Carconte went to a cupboard , and returned with an old <unk> pocket-book and a bag .
From the former she took some <unk> letters , and put in their place the bank-notes , and from the bag took two or three crowns of six livres each , which , in all probability , formed the entire fortune of the miserable couple .
“ ‘ There , ’ said Caderousse ; ‘ and now , although you have <unk> us of perhaps <unk> francs , will you have your supper with us ?
I invite you with <unk> . ’ “ ‘ Thank you , ’ replied the jeweller , ‘ it must be getting late , and I must return to <unk> — my wife will be getting uneasy . ’ He drew out his watch , and exclaimed , ‘ _ <unk> ! _ nearly nine o ’ clock — why , I shall not get back to <unk> before midnight !
<unk> , my friends .
If the Abbé Busoni should by any accident return , think of me . ’ “ ‘ In another week you will have left <unk> , ’ remarked Caderousse , ‘ for the fair ends in a few days . ’ “ ‘ True , but that makes no difference .
<unk> to me at Paris , to M. <unk> , in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , No .
<unk> .
I will make the journey on purpose to see him , if it is worth while . ’ “ At this moment there was a tremendous <unk> of thunder , accompanied by a flash of lightning so <unk> , that it quite <unk> the light of the lamp .
<unk> “ ‘ See here , ’ exclaimed Caderousse .
‘ You cannot think of going out in such weather as this . ’ “ ‘ Oh , I am not afraid of thunder , ’ said the jeweller .
“ ‘ And then there are <unk> , ’ said La Carconte .
‘ The road is never very safe during fair time . ’ “ ‘ Oh , as to the <unk> , ’ said <unk> , ‘ here is something for them , ’ and he drew from his pocket a pair of small pistols , loaded to the <unk> .
‘ Here , ’ said he , ‘ are dogs who <unk> and <unk> at the same time , they are for the two first who shall have a <unk> for your diamond , <unk> Caderousse . ’ “ Caderousse and his wife again <unk> a meaning look .
It seemed as though they were both inspired at the same time with some horrible thought .
‘ Well , then , a good journey to you , ’ said Caderousse .
“ ‘ Thanks , ’ replied the jeweller .
He then took his cane , which he had placed against an old cupboard , and went out .
At the moment when he opened the door , such a <unk> of wind came in that the lamp was nearly extinguished .
‘ Oh , ’ said he , ‘ this is very nice weather , and two leagues to go in such a storm . ’ “ ‘ <unk> , ’ said Caderousse .
‘ You can sleep here . ’ “ ‘ Yes ; do stay , ’ added La Carconte in a <unk> voice ; ‘ we will take every care of you . ’ “ ‘ No ; I must sleep at <unk> .
So , once more , <unk> . ’ Caderousse followed him slowly to the threshold .
‘ I can see neither heaven nor earth , ’ said the jeweller , who was outside the door .
‘ Do I turn to the right , or to the left hand ? ’ “ ‘ To the right , ’ said Caderousse .
‘ You cannot go wrong — the road is bordered by trees on both sides . ’ “ ‘ Good — all right , ’ said a voice almost lost in the distance .
“ ‘ <unk> the door , ’ said La Carconte ; ‘ I do not like open doors when it <unk> . ’ “ ‘ <unk> when there is money in the house , <unk> ? ’ answered Caderousse , <unk> the door .
<unk> “ He came into the room , went to the cupboard , took out the bag and pocket-book , and both began , for the third time , to count their gold and bank-notes .
I never saw such an expression of <unk> as the <unk> lamp revealed in those two <unk> .
The woman , especially , was hideous ; her usual feverish <unk> was <unk> , her countenance had become livid , and her eyes resembled burning <unk> .
“ ‘ Why , ’ she inquired in a hoarse voice , ‘ did you invite him to sleep here tonight ? ’ “ ‘ Why ? ’ said Caderousse with a shudder ; ‘ why , that he might not have the trouble of returning to <unk> . ’ “ ‘ Ah , ’ responded the woman , with an expression impossible to describe ; ‘ I thought it was for something else . ’ “ ‘ <unk> , woman — why do you have such ideas ? ’ cried Caderousse ; ‘ or , if you have them , why don ’ t you keep them to yourself ? ’ “ ‘ Well , ’ said La Carconte , after a moment ’ s pause , ‘ you are not a man . ’ “ ‘ What do you mean ? ’ added Caderousse .
“ ‘ If you had been a man , you would not have let him go from here . ’ “ ‘ <unk> ! ’ “ ‘ Or else he should not have reached <unk> . ’ “ ‘ <unk> ! ’ “ ‘ The road takes a turn — he is obliged to follow it — while <unk> of the <unk> there is a <unk> road . ’ “ ‘ <unk> ! — you <unk> the good God .
There — listen ! ’ And at this moment there was a tremendous <unk> of thunder , while the livid lightning <unk> the room , and the thunder , rolling away in the distance , seemed to <unk> <unk> from the cursed abode .
‘ <unk> ! ’ said Caderousse , crossing himself .
<unk> “ At the same moment , and in the midst of the <unk> silence which usually follows a <unk> of thunder , they heard a <unk> at the door .
Caderousse and his wife started and looked <unk> at each other .
“ ‘ Who ’ s there ? ’ cried Caderousse , rising , and drawing up in a heap the gold and notes scattered over the table , and which he covered with his two hands .
“ ‘ It is I , ’ shouted a voice .
“ ‘ And who are you ? ’ “ ‘ <unk> , _ <unk> ! _ <unk> , the jeweller . ’ “ ‘ Well , and you said I offended the good God , ’ said La Carconte with a horrid smile .
‘ Why , the good God sends him back again . ’ Caderousse sank pale and breathless into his chair .
“ La Carconte , on the contrary , rose , and going with a firm step towards the door , opened it , saying , as she did so : “ ‘ Come in , dear M. <unk> . ’ “ ‘ _ Ma foi _ , ’ said the jeweller , <unk> with rain , ‘ I am not destined to return to <unk> tonight .
The <unk> <unk> are best , my dear Caderousse .
You offered me hospitality , and I accept it , and have returned to sleep beneath your friendly roof . ’ “ Caderousse stammered out something , while he wiped away the <unk> that started to his brow .
La Carconte <unk> the door behind the jeweller . ” Chapter <unk> .
The <unk> of <unk> As the jeweller returned to the apartment , he cast around him a <unk> glance — but there was nothing to excite suspicion , if it did not exist , or to <unk> it , if it were already awakened .
Caderousse ’ s hands still grasped the gold and bank-notes , and La Carconte called up her <unk> smiles while <unk> the <unk> of their guest .
“ ‘ Well , well , ’ said the jeweller , ‘ you seem , my good friends , to have had some fears respecting the <unk> of your money , by <unk> it over so carefully directly I was gone . ’ “ ‘ Oh , no , ’ answered Caderousse , ‘ that was not my reason , I can assure you ; but the circumstances by which we have become possessed of this wealth are so unexpected , as to make us scarcely credit our good fortune , and it is only by placing the actual proof of our riches before our eyes that we can persuade ourselves that the whole affair is not a dream . ’ “ The jeweller smiled .
‘ Have you any other guests in your house ? ’ inquired he .
“ ‘ Nobody but ourselves , ’ replied Caderousse ; ‘ the fact is , we do not lodge travellers — indeed , our tavern is so near the town , that nobody would think of stopping here . ’ “ ‘ Then I am afraid I shall very much inconvenience you . ’ “ ‘ <unk> us ?
Not at all , my dear sir , ’ said La Carconte in her most gracious manner .
‘ Not at all , I assure you . ’ “ ‘ But where will you manage to <unk> me ? ’ “ ‘ In the chamber <unk> . ’ “ ‘ <unk> that is where you yourselves sleep ? ’ “ ‘ Never mind that ; we have a second bed in the adjoining room . ’ “ Caderousse stared at his wife with much astonishment .
“ The jeweller , meanwhile , was <unk> a song as he stood <unk> his back at the fire La Carconte had <unk> to dry the wet garments of her guest ; and this done , she next occupied herself in arranging his supper , by <unk> a <unk> at the end of the table , and placing on it the <unk> remains of their dinner , to which she added three or four <unk> <unk> .
Caderousse had once more parted with his treasure — the <unk> were replaced in the pocket-book , the gold put back into the bag , and the whole carefully locked in the cupboard .
He then began <unk> the room with a <unk> and gloomy air , glancing from time to time at the jeweller , who stood <unk> with the <unk> from his wet clothes , and merely changing his place on the warm hearth , to <unk> the whole of his garments to be dried .
“ ‘ There , ’ said La Carconte , as she placed a bottle of wine on the table , ‘ supper is ready whenever you are . ’ “ ‘ And you ? ’ asked <unk> .
“ ‘ I don ’ t want any supper , ’ said Caderousse .
“ ‘ We dined so very late , ’ hastily <unk> La Carconte .
“ ‘ Then it seems I am to eat alone , ’ remarked the jeweller .
“ ‘ Oh , we shall have the pleasure of waiting upon you , ’ answered La Carconte , with an eager attention she was not accustomed to <unk> even to guests who paid for what they took .
“ From time to time Caderousse darted on his wife <unk> , searching glances , but rapid as the lightning flash .
The storm still continued .
“ ‘ There , there , ’ said La Carconte ; ‘ do you hear that ?
upon my word , you did well to come back . ’ “ ‘ Nevertheless , ’ replied the jeweller , ‘ if by the time I have finished my supper the tempest has at all <unk> , I shall make another start . ’ “ ‘ It ’ s the <unk> , ’ said Caderousse , ‘ and it will be sure to last till tomorrow morning . ’ He sighed heavily .
“ ‘ Well , ’ said the jeweller , as he placed himself at table , ‘ all I can say is , so much the worse for those who are abroad . ’ “ ‘ Yes , ’ <unk> in La Carconte , ‘ they will have a wretched night of it . ’ “ The jeweller began eating his supper , and the woman , who was <unk> so <unk> and indifferent to all who approached her , was suddenly <unk> into the most smiling and attentive <unk> .
Had the unhappy man on whom she <unk> her <unk> been previously acquainted with her , so sudden an alteration might well have excited suspicion in his mind , or at least have greatly astonished him .
Caderousse , meanwhile , continued to pace the room in gloomy silence , <unk> <unk> the sight of his guest ; but as soon as the stranger had completed his <unk> , the agitated innkeeper went eagerly to the door and opened it .
“ ‘ I believe the storm is over , ’ said he .
“ But as if to <unk> his statement , at that instant a violent <unk> of thunder seemed to shake the house to its very foundation , while a sudden <unk> of wind , mingled with rain , extinguished the lamp he held in his hand .
“ <unk> and <unk> , Caderousse hastily shut the door and returned to his guest , while La Carconte lighted a candle by the <unk> ashes that <unk> on the hearth .
“ ‘ You must be tired , ’ said she to the jeweller ; ‘ I have spread a pair of white sheets on your bed ; go up when you are ready , and sleep well . ’ “ <unk> <unk> for a while to see whether the storm seemed to <unk> in its fury , but a brief space of time sufficed to assure him that , instead of <unk> , the violence of the rain and thunder <unk> increased ; <unk> himself , therefore , to what seemed <unk> , he bade his host <unk> , and mounted the stairs .
He passed over my head and I heard the <unk> <unk> beneath his footsteps .
The quick , eager glance of La Carconte followed him as he ascended , while Caderousse , on the contrary , turned his back , and seemed most anxiously to avoid even glancing at him .
“ All these circumstances did not strike me as <unk> at the time as they have since done ; in fact , all that had happened ( with the exception of the story of the diamond , which certainly did wear an air of <unk> ) , appeared natural enough , and called for neither apprehension nor <unk> ; but , worn out as I was with fatigue , and fully <unk> to proceed <unk> directly the tempest <unk> , I determined to obtain a few hours ’ sleep .
<unk> I could <unk> distinguish every movement of the jeweller , who , after making the best arrangements in his power for passing a comfortable night , threw himself on his bed , and I could hear it <unk> and groan beneath his weight .
“ <unk> my eyelids grew heavy , deep sleep stole over me , and having no suspicion of anything wrong , I sought not to shake it off .
I looked into the kitchen once more and saw Caderousse sitting by the side of a long table upon one of the low wooden <unk> which in country places are frequently used instead of chairs ; his back was turned towards me , so that I could not see the expression of his countenance — neither should I have been able to do so had he been placed differently , as his head was buried between his two hands .
La Carconte continued to gaze on him for some time , then <unk> her shoulders , she took her seat immediately opposite to him .
“ At this moment the <unk> <unk> threw up a fresh flame from the <unk> of a piece of wood that lay near , and a bright light <unk> over the room .
La Carconte still kept her eyes fixed on her husband , but as he made no sign of changing his position , she extended her hard , <unk> hand , and touched him on the forehead .
<unk> “ Caderousse shuddered .
The woman ’ s lips seemed to move , as though she were talking ; but because she merely spoke in an <unk> , or my senses were <unk> by sleep , I did not catch a word she uttered .
<unk> <unk> and sounds seemed to <unk> before me , and gradually I fell into a deep , heavy slumber .
How long I had been in this unconscious state I know not , when I was suddenly aroused by the report of a pistol , followed by a fearful cry .
<unk> and <unk> footsteps <unk> across the chamber above me , and the next instant a dull , heavy weight seemed to fall <unk> on the staircase .
I had not yet fully recovered consciousness , when again I heard <unk> , mingled with <unk> cries , as if from persons engaged in a deadly struggle .
A cry more prolonged than the others and <unk> in a series of <unk> <unk> roused me from my <unk> <unk> .
<unk> raising myself on one arm , I looked around , but all was dark ; and it seemed to me as if the rain must have penetrated through the <unk> of the room above , for some kind of <unk> appeared to fall , drop by drop , upon my forehead , and when I passed my hand across my brow , I felt that it was wet and <unk> .
“ To the fearful <unk> that had awakened me had succeeded the most perfect silence — <unk> , save by the footsteps of a man walking about in the chamber above .
The staircase <unk> , he descended into the room below , approached the fire and lit a candle .
“ The man was Caderousse — he was pale and his shirt was all <unk> .
Having obtained the light , he hurried upstairs again , and once more I heard his rapid and uneasy footsteps .
“ A moment later he came down again , holding in his hand the small <unk> case , which he opened , to assure himself it contained the diamond , — seemed to hesitate as to which pocket he should put it in , then , as if <unk> with the security of either pocket , he deposited it in his red handkerchief , which he carefully rolled round his head .
“ After this he took from his cupboard the bank-notes and gold he had put there , thrust the one into the pocket of his trousers , and the other into that of his waistcoat , hastily tied up a small bundle of linen , and rushing towards the door , disappeared in the darkness of the night .
“ Then all became clear and <unk> to me , and I <unk> myself with what had happened , as though I myself had done the guilty deed .
I fancied that I still heard faint <unk> , and <unk> that the unfortunate jeweller might not be quite dead , I determined to go to his relief , by way of <unk> in some slight degree , not for the crime I had committed , but for that which I had not endeavored to prevent .
For this purpose I applied all the strength I possessed to force an entrance from the <unk> spot in which I lay to the adjoining room .
The <unk> fastened <unk> which alone divided me from it yielded to my efforts , and I found myself in the house .
<unk> <unk> up the lighted candle , I hurried to the staircase ; about <unk> a body was lying quite across the stairs .
It was that of La Carconte .
The pistol I had heard had doubtless been fired at her .
The shot had <unk> <unk> her throat , leaving two <unk> wounds from which , as well as the mouth , the blood was <unk> in <unk> .
She was stone dead .
I <unk> past her , and ascended to the sleeping chamber , which presented an appearance of the <unk> disorder .
The furniture had been knocked over in the deadly struggle that had taken place there , and the sheets , to which the unfortunate jeweller had doubtless clung , were dragged across the room .
The murdered man lay on the floor , his head leaning against the wall , and about him was a <unk> of blood which poured forth from three large wounds in his breast ; there was a fourth <unk> , in which a long table knife was plunged up to the handle .
“ I <unk> over some object ; I <unk> to examine — it was the second pistol , which had not gone off , probably from the powder being wet .
I approached the jeweller , who was not quite dead , and at the sound of my footsteps and the <unk> of the floor , he opened his eyes , fixed them on me with an anxious and <unk> gaze , moved his lips as though trying to speak , then , overcome by the effort , fell back and <unk> .
“ This <unk> sight almost <unk> me of my senses , and finding that I could no longer be of service to anyone in the house , my only desire was to fly .
I rushed towards the staircase , <unk> my hair , and uttering a groan of horror .
“ Upon reaching the room below , I found five or six <unk> officers , and two or three gendarmes — all heavily armed .
They threw themselves upon me .
I made no resistance ; I was no longer master of my senses .
When I strove to speak , a few <unk> sounds alone escaped my lips .
“ As I noticed the significant manner in which the whole party pointed to my <unk> garments , I <unk> <unk> myself , and then I discovered that the thick warm drops that had so <unk> me as I lay beneath the staircase must have been the blood of La Carconte .
I pointed to the spot where I had concealed myself .
“ ‘ What does he mean ? ’ asked a gendarme .
“ One of the officers went to the place I directed .
“ ‘ He means , ’ replied the man upon his return , ‘ that he got in that way ; ’ and he showed the hole I had made when I broke through .
“ Then I saw that they took me for the assassin .
I recovered force and energy enough to free myself from the hands of those who held me , while I managed to <unk> forth : “ ‘ I did not do it !
Indeed , indeed I did not ! ’ “ A couple of gendarmes held the <unk> of their <unk> against my breast .
“ ‘ <unk> but a step , ’ said they , ‘ and you are a dead man . ’ “ ‘ Why should you <unk> me with death , ’ cried I , ‘ when I have already declared my innocence ? ’ “ ‘ <unk> , <unk> , ’ cried the men ; ‘ keep your innocent stories to tell to the judge at <unk> .
Meanwhile , come along with us ; and the best advice we can give you is to do so <unk> . ’ “ Alas , resistance was far from my thoughts .
I was utterly <unk> by surprise and terror ; and without a word I suffered myself to be <unk> and tied to a horse ’ s <unk> , and thus they took me to <unk> .
“ I had been <unk> by a <unk> , who had lost sight of me near the tavern ; feeling certain that I intended to pass the night there , he had returned to summon his comrades , who just arrived in time to hear the report of the pistol , and to take me in the midst of such <unk> proofs of my guilt as rendered all hopes of <unk> my innocence utterly <unk> .
One only chance was left me , that of <unk> the magistrate before whom I was taken to cause every inquiry to be made for the Abbé Busoni , who had stopped at the inn of the Pont du <unk> on that morning .
“ If Caderousse had invented the story relative to the diamond , and there existed no such person as the Abbé Busoni , then , indeed , I was lost past <unk> , or , at least , my life hung upon the feeble chance of Caderousse himself being <unk> and <unk> the whole truth .
“ Two months passed away in <unk> expectation on my part , while I must do the magistrate the justice to say that he used every means to obtain information of the person I declared could <unk> me if he would .
Caderousse still <unk> all pursuit , and I had resigned myself to what seemed my <unk> fate .
My trial was to come on at the approaching <unk> ; when , on the <unk> of September — that is to say , precisely three months and five days after the events which had <unk> my life — the Abbé Busoni , whom I never ventured to believe I should see , presented himself at the prison doors , saying he understood one of the prisoners wished to speak to him ; he added , that having learned at Marseilles the particulars of my <unk> , he hastened to comply with my desire .
“ You may easily imagine with what eagerness I welcomed him , and how <unk> I related the whole of what I had seen and heard .
I felt some degree of <unk> as I entered upon the history of the diamond , but , to my <unk> astonishment , he confirmed it in every particular , and to my equal surprise , he seemed to place entire belief in all I said .
“ And then it was that , won by his <unk> charity , seeing that he was acquainted with all the habits and customs of my own country , and considering also that pardon for the only crime of which I was really guilty might come with a double power from lips so benevolent and kind , I <unk> him to receive my confession , under the <unk> of which I <unk> the Auteuil affair in all its details , as well as every other <unk> of my life .
That which I had done by the impulse of my best feelings produced the same effect as though it had been the result of <unk> .
My <unk> confession of the <unk> at Auteuil proved to him that I had not committed that of which I stood accused .
When he quitted me , he bade me be of good courage , and to rely upon his doing all in his power to convince my judges of my innocence .
“ I had <unk> proofs that the excellent abbé was engaged in my <unk> , for the <unk> of my <unk> were <unk> by many trifling though <unk> <unk> , and I was told that my trial was to be <unk> to the <unk> following those now being held .
“ In the <unk> it pleased Providence to cause the apprehension of Caderousse , who was discovered in some distant country , and brought back to France , where he made a full confession , <unk> to make the fact of his wife ’ s having suggested and arranged the murder any excuse for his own guilt .
The wretched man was <unk> to the galleys for life , and I was immediately set at liberty . ” “ And then it was , I presume , ” said Monte Cristo “ that you came to me as the <unk> of a letter from the Abbé Busoni ? ” “ It was , your excellency ; the benevolent abbé took an evident interest in all that concerned me .
“ ‘ Your mode of life as a <unk> , ’ said he to me one day , ‘ will be the ruin of you ; if you get out , don ’ t take it up again . ’ “ ‘ But how , ’ inquired I , ‘ am I to <unk> myself and my poor sister ? ’ “ ‘ A person , whose <unk> I am , ’ replied he , ‘ and who <unk> a high regard for me , applied to me a short time since to procure him a <unk> servant .
Would you like such a post ?
If so , I will give you a letter of introduction to him . ’ “ ‘ Oh , father , ’ I exclaimed , ‘ you are very good . ’ “ ‘ But you must swear solemnly that I shall never have reason to <unk> my <unk> . ’ “ I extended my hand , and was about to <unk> myself by any promise he would <unk> , but he stopped me .
“ ‘ It is unnecessary for you to <unk> yourself by any <unk> , ’ said he ; ‘ I know and admire the Corsican nature too well to fear you .
Here , take this , ’ continued he , after rapidly writing the few lines I brought to your excellency , and upon receipt of which you <unk> to receive me into your service , and <unk> I ask whether your excellency has ever had cause to <unk> having done so ? ” “ No , ” replied the count ; “ I take pleasure in saying that you have served me <unk> , Bertuccio ; but you might have shown more confidence in me . ” “ I , your excellency ? ” “ Yes ; you .
How comes it , that having both a sister and an adopted son , you have never spoken to me of either ? ” <unk> “ Alas , I have still to <unk> the most <unk> period of my life .
<unk> as you may suppose I was to behold and comfort my dear sister , I lost no time in <unk> to Corsica , but when I arrived at <unk> I found a house of mourning , the <unk> of a scene so horrible that the neighbors remember and speak of it to this day .
<unk> by my advice , my poor sister had refused to comply with the <unk> demands of Benedetto , who was continually <unk> her for money , as long as he believed there was a sou left in her possession .
One morning he threatened her with the <unk> <unk> if she did not supply him with what he desired , and disappeared and remained away all day , leaving the <unk> <unk> , who loved him as if he were her own child , to weep over his conduct and <unk> his absence .
<unk> came , and still , with all the patient solicitude of a mother , she watched for his return .
“ As the <unk> hour struck , he entered with a <unk> air , attended by two of the most <unk> and <unk> of his <unk> companions .
She stretched out her arms to him , but they seized hold of her , and one of the three — none other than the <unk> Benedetto exclaimed : “ ‘ <unk> her to torture and she ’ ll soon tell us where her money is . ’ “ It unfortunately happened that our neighbor , <unk> , was at <unk> , leaving no person in his house but his wife ; no human creature beside could hear or see anything that took place within our dwelling .
Two held poor <unk> , who , unable to conceive that any harm was intended to her , smiled in the face of those who were soon to become her <unk> .
The third proceeded to barricade the doors and windows , then returned , and the three united in <unk> the cries of terror <unk> by the sight of these <unk> , and then dragged <unk> feet <unk> towards the brazier , expecting to <unk> from her an <unk> of where her supposed treasure was <unk> .
In the struggle her clothes caught fire , and they were obliged to let go their hold in order to preserve themselves from <unk> the same fate .
<unk> with flames , <unk> rushed <unk> to the door , but it was fastened ; she flew to the windows , but they were also secured ; then the neighbors heard frightful <unk> ; it was <unk> calling for help .
The cries died away in <unk> , and next morning , as soon as <unk> ’ s wife could <unk> up courage to venture abroad , she caused the door of our dwelling to be opened by the public authorities , when <unk> , although dreadfully burnt , was found still breathing ; every drawer and <unk> in the house had been forced open , and the money stolen .
Benedetto never again appeared at <unk> , neither have I since that day either seen or heard anything concerning him .
“ It was <unk> to these dreadful events that I waited on your excellency , to whom it would have been folly to have mentioned Benedetto , since all trace of him seemed entirely lost ; or of my sister , since she was dead . ” “ And in what light did you view the <unk> ? ” inquired Monte Cristo .
“ As a punishment for the crime I had committed , ” answered Bertuccio .
“ Oh , those <unk> are an <unk> race ! ” “ <unk> they are , ” murmured the count in a lugubrious tone .
“ And now , ” resumed Bertuccio , “ your excellency may , perhaps , be able to comprehend that this place , which I <unk> for the first time — this garden , the actual scene of my crime — must have given rise to reflections of no very agreeable nature , and produced that gloom and <unk> of spirits which excited the notice of your excellency , who was pleased to express a desire to know the cause .
At this instant a shudder passes over me as I reflect that possibly I am now standing on the very grave in which lies M. de Villefort , by whose hand the ground was dug to receive the corpse of his child . ” “ Everything is possible , ” said Monte Cristo , rising from the bench on which he had been sitting ; “ even , ” he added in an <unk> voice , “ even that the procureur be not dead .
The Abbé Busoni did right to send you to me , ” he went on in his ordinary tone , “ and you have done well in relating to me the whole of your history , as it will prevent my forming any <unk> opinions concerning you in future .
As for that Benedetto , who so <unk> <unk> his name , have you never made any effort to trace out whither he has gone , or what has become of him ? ” “ No ; far from wishing to learn whither he has <unk> himself , I should <unk> the possibility of meeting him as I would a wild beast .
Thank God , I have never heard his name mentioned by any person , and I hope and believe he is dead . ” “ Do not think so , Bertuccio , ” replied the count ; “ for the wicked are not so easily disposed of , for God seems to have them under his special <unk> to make of them instruments of his vengeance . ” “ So be it , ” responded Bertuccio , “ all I ask of heaven is that I may never see him again .
And now , your excellency , ” he added , bowing his head , “ you know everything — you are my judge on earth , as the <unk> is in heaven ; have you for me no words of consolation ? ” “ My good friend , I can only repeat the words addressed to you by the Abbé Busoni .
Villefort <unk> punishment for what he had done to you , and , perhaps , to others .
Benedetto , if still living , will become the instrument of divine <unk> in some way or other , and then be <unk> punished in his turn .
As far as you yourself are concerned , I see but one point in which you are really guilty .
<unk> yourself , <unk> , after <unk> the infant from its living grave , you did not restore it to its mother ?
There was the crime , Bertuccio — that was where you became really <unk> . ” “ True , excellency , that was the crime , the real crime , for in that I acted like a coward .
My first duty , directly I had succeeded in <unk> the <unk> to life , was to restore it to its mother ; but , in order to do so , I must have made close and careful inquiry , which would , in all probability , have led to my own apprehension ; and I clung to life , partly on my sister ’ s account , and partly from that feeling of pride <unk> in our hearts of <unk> to come off <unk> and <unk> in the execution of our vengeance .
Perhaps , too , the natural and <unk> love of life made me wish to avoid <unk> my own .
And then , again , I am not as brave and <unk> as was my poor brother . ” Bertuccio hid his face in his hands as he uttered these words , while Monte Cristo fixed on him a look of <unk> meaning .
After a brief silence , rendered still more solemn by the time and place , the count said , in a tone of melancholy wholly unlike his usual manner : “ In order to bring this conversation to a <unk> <unk> ( the last we shall ever hold upon this subject ) , I will repeat to you some words I have heard from the lips of the Abbé Busoni .
For all evils there are two <unk> — time and silence .
And now leave me , Monsieur Bertuccio , to walk alone here in the garden .
The very circumstances which <unk> on you , as a principal in the tragic scene <unk> here , such painful emotions , are to me , on the contrary , a source of something like <unk> , and serve but to <unk> the value of this dwelling in my <unk> .
The chief beauty of trees <unk> in the deep shadow of their <unk> <unk> , while fancy <unk> a moving multitude of <unk> and forms <unk> and passing beneath that shade .
Here I have a garden laid out in such a way as to afford the <unk> <unk> for the imagination , and furnished with <unk> grown trees , beneath whose <unk> screen a <unk> like myself may <unk> up <unk> at will .
This to me , who expected but to find a <unk> enclosure surrounded by a straight wall , is , I assure you , a most agreeable surprise .
I have no fear of <unk> , and I have never heard it said that so much harm had been done by the dead during six thousand years as is <unk> by the living in a single day .
<unk> within , Bertuccio , and <unk> your mind .
Should your <unk> be less <unk> to you in your dying moments than you found the Abbé Busoni , send for me , if I am still on earth , and I will <unk> your ears with words that shall <unk> calm and <unk> your parting soul ere it goes forth to traverse the ocean called eternity . ” Bertuccio bowed <unk> , and turned away , <unk> heavily .
Monte Cristo , left alone , took three or four steps <unk> , and murmured : “ Here , beneath this <unk> , must have been where the infant ’ s grave was dug .
There is the little door opening into the garden .
At this corner is the private staircase <unk> with the sleeping apartment .
There will be no necessity for me to make a note of these particulars , for there , before my eyes , beneath my feet , all around me , I have the plan <unk> with all the living reality of truth . ” After making the tour of the garden a second time , the count re-entered his carriage , while Bertuccio , who perceived the thoughtful expression of his master ’ s features , took his seat beside the driver without uttering a word .
The carriage proceeded rapidly towards Paris .
That same evening , upon reaching his abode in the Champs-Élysées , the Count of Monte Cristo went over the whole building with the air of one long acquainted with each <unk> or corner .
Nor , although preceding the party , did he once mistake one door for another , or commit the smallest error when <unk> any particular corridor or staircase to conduct him to a place or <unk> of rooms he desired to visit .
Ali was his principal attendant during this nocturnal <unk> .
Having given various orders to Bertuccio relative to the <unk> and <unk> he desired to make in the house , the Count , drawing out his watch , said to the attentive <unk> : “ It is half-past eleven o ’ clock ; Haydée will soon be here .
Have the French attendants been summoned to await her coming ? ” Ali extended his hands towards the apartments destined for the fair Greek , which were so <unk> concealed by means of a <unk> entrance , that it would have <unk> the most curious to have divined their existence .
Ali , having pointed to the apartments , held up three fingers of his right hand , and then , placing it beneath his head , shut his eyes , and <unk> to sleep .
“ I understand , ” said Monte Cristo , well acquainted with Ali ’ s <unk> ; “ you mean to tell me that three female attendants await their new mistress in her <unk> . ” Ali , with considerable animation , made a sign in the <unk> .
“ Madame will be tired tonight , ” continued Monte Cristo , “ and will , no doubt , wish to rest .
<unk> the French attendants not to weary her with questions , but merely to pay their respectful duty and retire .
You will also see that the Greek servants hold no communication with those of this country . ” He bowed .
Just at that moment voices were heard <unk> the concierge .
The gate opened , a carriage rolled down the <unk> , and stopped at the steps .
The count hastily descended , presented himself at the already opened carriage door , and held out his hand to a young woman , completely enveloped in a green silk mantle heavily embroidered with gold .
She raised the hand extended towards her to her lips , and kissed it with a mixture of love and respect .
Some few words passed between them in that <unk> language in which <unk> makes his <unk> <unk> .
The young woman spoke with an expression of deep tenderness , while the count replied with an air of gentle gravity .
<unk> by Ali , who carried a <unk> <unk> in his hand , the young lady , who was no other than the lovely Greek who had been Monte Cristo ’ s companion in Italy , was conducted to her apartments , while the count retired to the <unk> reserved for himself .
In another hour every light in the house was extinguished , and it might have been thought that all its <unk> slept .
Chapter <unk> .
<unk> <unk> About two o ’ clock the following day a <unk> , drawn by a pair of magnificent English horses , stopped at the door of Monte Cristo and a person , dressed in a blue coat , with <unk> of a similar color , a white waistcoat , over which was displayed a <unk> gold chain , brown trousers , and a quantity of black hair descending so low over his eyebrows as to leave it doubtful whether it were not <unk> so little did its <unk> <unk> <unk> with the deep <unk> stamped on his features — a person , in a word , who , although evidently past fifty , desired to be taken for not more than forty , bent <unk> from the carriage door , on the <unk> of which were <unk> the <unk> <unk> of a baron , and directed his <unk> to inquire at the porter ’ s lodge whether the Count of Monte Cristo <unk> there , and if he were within .
While waiting , the <unk> of the carriage <unk> the house , the garden as far as he could distinguish it , and the <unk> of servants who passed to and fro , with an attention so close as to be somewhat <unk> .
His glance was <unk> but showed cunning rather than intelligence ; his lips were straight , and so thin that , as they closed , they were drawn in over the teeth ; his <unk> were broad and <unk> , a <unk> proof of <unk> and <unk> ; while the <unk> of his forehead , and the <unk> of the back of his <unk> , which rose much higher than his large and <unk> <unk> ears , combined to form a physiognomy anything but <unk> , save in the eyes of such as considered that the owner of so splendid an <unk> must needs be all that was admirable and <unk> , more especially when they gazed on the enormous diamond that <unk> in his shirt , and the red ribbon that depended from his <unk> .
The <unk> , in obedience to his orders , <unk> at the window of the porter ’ s lodge , saying : “ Pray , does not the Count of Monte Cristo live here ? ” “ His excellency does <unk> here , ” replied the concierge ; “ but — — ” added he , glancing an <unk> look at Ali .
Ali returned a sign in the <unk> .
“ But what ? ” asked the <unk> .
“ His excellency does not receive visitors today . ” “ Then here is my master ’ s card , the Baron Danglars .
You will take it to the count , and say that , although in haste to attend the Chamber , my master came out of his way to have the honor of calling upon him . ” “ I never speak to his excellency , ” replied the concierge ; “ the valet de chambre will carry your message . ” The <unk> returned to the carriage .
“ Well ? ” asked Danglars .
The man , somewhat <unk> by the <unk> he had received , repeated what the concierge had said .
“ <unk> me , ” murmured Baron Danglars , “ this must surely be a prince instead of a count by their <unk> him ‘ excellency , ’ and only <unk> to address him by the medium of his valet de chambre .
However , it does not signify ; he has a letter of credit on me , so I must see him when he requires his money . ” Then , throwing himself back in his carriage , Danglars called out to his coachman , in a voice that might be heard across the road , “ To the Chamber of <unk> . ” <unk> in time of the visit paid him , Monte Cristo had , from behind the <unk> of his <unk> , as <unk> observed the baron , by means of an excellent <unk> , as Danglars himself had scrutinized the house , garden , and servants .
“ That fellow has a decidedly bad countenance , ” said the count in a tone of disgust , as he shut up his glass into its <unk> case .
“ How comes it that all do not retreat in <unk> at sight of that flat , <unk> , <unk> forehead , round , <unk> head , and <unk> nose , like the <unk> of a <unk> ?
Ali , ” cried he , striking at the same time on the <unk> <unk> .
Ali appeared .
“ <unk> Bertuccio , ” said the count .
<unk> immediately Bertuccio entered the apartment .
“ Did your excellency desire to see me ? ” inquired he .
“ I did , ” replied the count .
“ You no doubt observed the horses standing a few minutes since at the door ? ” “ Certainly , your excellency .
I noticed them for their remarkable beauty . ” “ Then how comes it , ” said Monte Cristo with a <unk> , “ that , when I desired you to purchase for me the <unk> pair of horses to be found in Paris , there is another pair , fully as fine as mine , not in my <unk> ? ” At the look of <unk> , added to the angry tone in which the count spoke , Ali turned pale and held down his head .
“ It is not your fault , my good Ali , ” said the count in the <unk> language , and with a gentleness none would have thought him capable of showing , either in voice or face — “ it is not your fault .
You do not understand the points of English horses . ” The countenance of poor Ali recovered its serenity .
“ <unk> me to assure your excellency , ” said Bertuccio , “ that the horses you speak of were not to be sold when I purchased yours . ” Monte Cristo shrugged his shoulders .
“ It seems , sir steward , ” said he , “ that you have yet to learn that all things are to be sold to such as care to pay the price . ” “ His excellency is not , perhaps , aware that M. Danglars gave <unk> francs for his horses ? ” “ Very well .
Then offer him double that sum ; a banker never <unk> an opportunity of <unk> his capital . ” “ Is your excellency really in earnest ? ” inquired the steward .
Monte Cristo regarded the person who <unk> presume to doubt his words with the look of one equally surprised and displeased .
“ I have to pay a visit this evening , ” replied he .
“ I desire that these horses , with completely new <unk> , may be at the door with my carriage . ” Bertuccio bowed , and was about to retire ; but when he reached the door , he paused , and then said , “ At what o ’ clock does your excellency wish the carriage and horses to be ready ? ” “ At five o ’ clock , ” replied the count .
“ I beg your excellency ’ s pardon , ” <unk> the steward in a <unk> manner , “ for <unk> to observe that it is already two o ’ clock . ” “ I am perfectly aware of that fact , ” answered Monte Cristo calmly .
Then , turning towards Ali , he said , “ Let all the horses in my <unk> be led before the windows of your young lady , that she may <unk> those she <unk> for her carriage .
<unk> her also to oblige me by saying whether it is her pleasure to dine with me ; if so , let dinner be served in her apartments .
Now , leave me , and desire my valet de chambre to come hither . ” <unk> had Ali disappeared when the valet entered the chamber .
“ Monsieur Baptistin , ” said the count , “ you have been in my service one year , the time I generally give myself to judge of the <unk> or <unk> of those about me .
You suit me very well . ” Baptistin bowed low .
“ It only remains for me to know whether I also suit you ? ” “ Oh , your excellency ! ” exclaimed Baptistin eagerly .
“ Listen , if you please , till I have finished speaking , ” replied Monte Cristo .
“ You receive <unk> francs per <unk> for your services here — more than many a brave <unk> , who continually <unk> his life for his country , <unk> .
You live in a manner far superior to many <unk> who work ten times <unk> than you do for their money .
Then , though yourself a servant , you have other servants to wait upon you , take care of your clothes , and see that your linen is <unk> prepared for you .
Again , you make a profit upon each article you purchase for my toilet , <unk> in the course of a year to a sum <unk> your <unk> . ” “ Nay , indeed , your excellency . ” “ I am not <unk> you for this , Monsieur Baptistin ; but let your <unk> end here .
It would be long indeed ere you would find so <unk> a post as that you have now the good fortune to fill .
I neither <unk> nor <unk> my servants by word or action .
An error I readily forgive , but <unk> <unk> or forgetfulness , never .
My <unk> are <unk> short , clear , and precise ; and I would rather be obliged to repeat my words twice , or even three times , than they should be <unk> .
I am rich enough to know whatever I desire to know , and I can promise you I am not wanting in curiosity .
If , then , I should learn that you had taken upon yourself to speak of me to anyone <unk> or <unk> , to <unk> on my actions , or watch my conduct , that very instant you would quit my service .
You may now retire .
I never caution my servants a second time — remember that . ” Baptistin bowed , and was proceeding towards the door .
“ I forgot to mention to you , ” said the count , “ that I lay <unk> aside a certain sum for each servant in my establishment ; those whom I am compelled to <unk> lose ( as a matter of course ) all <unk> in this money , while their portion goes to the <unk> <unk> for those <unk> who remain with me , and among whom it will be divided at my death .
You have been in my service a year , your <unk> has already begun to <unk> — let it continue to do so . ” This address , delivered in the presence of Ali , who , not understanding one word of the language in which it was spoken , stood wholly <unk> , produced an effect on M. Baptistin only to be conceived by such as have occasion to study the character and disposition of French <unk> .
“ I assure your excellency , ” said he , “ that at least it shall be my study to merit your approbation in all things , and I will take M. Ali as my <unk> . ” “ By no means , ” replied the count in the most <unk> tones ; “ Ali has many faults mixed with most excellent qualities .
He cannot possibly serve you as a pattern for your conduct , not being , as you are , a paid servant , but a mere slave — a dog , who , should he fail in his duty towards me , I should not discharge from my service , but kill . ” Baptistin opened his eyes with astonishment .
“ You seem <unk> , ” said Monte Cristo , who repeated to Ali in the <unk> language what he had just been saying to Baptistin in French .
The <unk> smiled <unk> to his master ’ s words , then , kneeling on one knee , <unk> kissed the hand of the count .
This <unk> of the lesson he had just received put the <unk> stroke to the wonder and <unk> of M. Baptistin .
The count then motioned the valet de chambre to retire , and to Ali to follow to his study , where they <unk> long and earnestly together .
As the hand of the clock pointed to five the count struck <unk> upon his <unk> .
When Ali was wanted one stroke was given , two summoned Baptistin , and three Bertuccio .
The steward entered .
“ My horses , ” said Monte Cristo .
“ They are at the door <unk> to the carriage as your excellency desired .
Does your excellency wish me to accompany him ? ” “ No , the coachman , Ali , and Baptistin will go . ” The count descended to the door of his <unk> , and beheld his carriage drawn by the very pair of horses he had so much admired in the morning as the property of Danglars .
As he passed them he said : “ They are extremely handsome certainly , and you have done well to purchase them , although you were somewhat <unk> not to have procured them sooner . ” “ Indeed , your excellency , I had very considerable difficulty in obtaining them , and , as it is , they have cost an enormous price . ” “ Does the sum you gave for them make the animals less beautiful , ” inquired the count , <unk> his shoulders .
“ Nay , if your excellency is satisfied , it is all that I could wish .
<unk> does your excellency desire to be driven ? ” “ To the residence of Baron Danglars , Rue de la <unk> d ’ <unk> . ” This conversation had passed as they stood upon the <unk> , from which a flight of stone steps led to the <unk> .
As Bertuccio , with a respectful bow , was moving away , the count called him back .
“ I have another commission for you , M. Bertuccio , ” said he ; “ I am desirous of having an estate by the <unk> in <unk> — for instance , between Le <unk> and <unk> .
You see I give you a wide <unk> .
It will be absolutely necessary that the place you may <unk> have a small <unk> , <unk> , or <unk> , into which my <unk> can enter and remain at anchor .
She <unk> only fifteen feet .
She must be kept in constant readiness to sail immediately I think proper to give the signal .
Make the requisite inquiries for a place of this description , and when you have met with an <unk> spot , visit it , and if it possess the advantages desired , purchase it at once in your own name .
The <unk> must now , I think , be on her way to <unk> , must she not ? ” <unk> “ Certainly , your excellency ; I saw her put to sea the same evening we quitted Marseilles . ” “ And the yacht . ” “ Was ordered to remain at <unk> . ” “ ’ Tis well .
I wish you to write from time to time to the <unk> in charge of the two <unk> so as to keep them on the <unk> . ” “ And the <unk> ? ” “ She is at <unk> ? ” “ Yes . ” “ The same orders for her as for the two <unk> <unk> . ” “ Very good . ” “ When you have purchased the estate I desire , I want constant <unk> of horses at ten leagues apart along the <unk> and <unk> road . ” “ Your excellency may depend upon me . ” The Count made a gesture of satisfaction , descended the <unk> steps , and sprang into his carriage , which was <unk> along <unk> to the banker ’ s house .
Danglars was engaged at that moment , <unk> over a <unk> <unk> .
But the meeting was nearly concluded when the name of his visitor was announced .
As the count ’ s title sounded on his ear he rose , and addressing his <unk> , who were members of one or the other Chamber , he said : “ Gentlemen , pardon me for leaving you so abruptly ; but a most ridiculous circumstance has occurred , which is this , — Thomson &amp; French , the Roman <unk> , have sent to me a certain person calling himself the Count of Monte Cristo , and have given him an <unk> credit with me .
I confess this is the <unk> thing I have ever met with in the course of my <unk> foreign <unk> , and you may readily suppose it has greatly roused my curiosity .
I took the trouble this morning to call on the pretended count — if he were a real count he wouldn ’ t be so rich .
But , would you believe it , ‘ He was not receiving . ’ So the master of Monte Cristo gives himself <unk> <unk> a great <unk> or a <unk> beauty .
I made inquiries , and found that the house in the Champs-Élysées is his own property , and certainly it was very <unk> kept up .
But , ” pursued Danglars with one of his sinister smiles , “ an order for <unk> credit calls for something like caution on the part of the banker to whom that order is given .
I am very anxious to see this man .
I suspect a <unk> is intended , but the <unk> of it little knew whom they had to deal with .
‘ They laugh best who laugh last ! ’ ” Having delivered himself of this <unk> address , uttered with a degree of energy that left the baron almost out of breath , he bowed to the assembled party and withdrew to his drawing-room , whose <unk> <unk> of white and gold had caused a great sensation in the <unk> d ’ <unk> .
It was to this apartment he had desired his guest to be shown , with the purpose of <unk> him at the sight of so much luxury .
He found the count standing before some copies of <unk> and <unk> that had been passed off to the banker as <unk> ; but which , mere copies as they were , seemed to feel their <unk> in being brought into <unk> with the <unk> colors that covered the ceiling .
The count turned round as he heard the entrance of Danglars into the room .
With a slight inclination of the head , Danglars signed to the count to be seated , pointing <unk> to a gilded armchair , covered with white satin embroidered with gold .
The count sat down .
<unk> “ I have the honor , I presume , of addressing M. de Monte Cristo . ” The count bowed .
“ And I of speaking to Baron Danglars , <unk> of the Legion of Honor , and member of the Chamber of <unk> ? ” Monte Cristo repeated all the <unk> he had read on the baron ’ s card .
Danglars felt the <unk> and <unk> his lips .
“ You will , I trust , excuse me , monsieur , for not calling you by your title when I first addressed you , ” he said , “ but you are aware that we are living under a popular form of government , and that I am myself a <unk> of the <unk> of the people . ” “ So much so , ” replied Monte Cristo , “ that while you call yourself baron you are not willing to call anybody else count . ” “ Upon my word , monsieur , ” said Danglars with affected <unk> , “ I attach no sort of value to such empty <unk> ; but the fact is , I was made baron , and also <unk> of the Legion of Honor , in return for services rendered , but — — ” “ But you have <unk> your <unk> after the example set you by <unk> de <unk> and <unk> ?
That was a noble example to follow , monsieur . ” “ Why , ” replied Danglars , “ not entirely so ; with the servants , — you understand . ” “ I see ; to your <unk> you are ‘ my lord , ’ the <unk> style you ‘ monsieur , ’ while your <unk> call you ‘ citizen . ’ These are <unk> very suitable under a <unk> government .
I understand perfectly . ” Again Danglars bit his lips ; he saw that he was no match for Monte Cristo in an <unk> of this sort , and he therefore hastened to turn to subjects more <unk> .
“ <unk> me to inform you , Count , ” said he , bowing , “ that I have received a letter of advice from Thomson &amp; French , of Rome . ” “ I am glad to hear it , baron , — for I must claim the privilege of addressing you after the manner of your servants .
I have acquired the bad habit of calling persons by their <unk> from living in a country where <unk> are still <unk> by right of birth .
But as <unk> the letter of advice , I am <unk> to find that it has reached you ; that will spare me the troublesome and disagreeable task of coming to you for money myself .
You have received a regular letter of advice ? ” “ Yes , ” said Danglars , “ but I confess I didn ’ t quite comprehend its meaning . ” “ Indeed ? ” “ And for that reason I did myself the honor of calling upon you , in order to beg for an explanation . ” “ Go on , monsieur .
Here I am , ready to give you any explanation you desire . ” “ Why , ” said Danglars , “ in the letter — I believe I have it about me ” — here he felt in his <unk> — “ yes , here it is .
Well , this letter gives the Count of Monte Cristo <unk> credit on our house . ” “ Well , baron , what is there difficult to understand about that ? ” “ <unk> the <unk> _ <unk> _ — nothing else , certainly . ” “ Is not that word known in France ?
The people who wrote are <unk> , you know . ” “ Oh , as for the <unk> of the letter , there is nothing to be said ; but as <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , I certainly have doubts . ” “ Is it possible ? ” asked the count , <unk> all air and tone of the utmost simplicity and <unk> .
“ Is it possible that Thomson &amp; French are not looked upon as safe and <unk> <unk> ?
Pray tell me what you think , baron , for I feel uneasy , I can assure you , having some considerable property in their hands . ” “ Thomson &amp; French are perfectly <unk> , ” replied Danglars , with an almost <unk> smile ; “ but the word _ <unk> _ , in <unk> affairs , is so extremely vague . ” “ Is , in fact , <unk> , ” said Monte Cristo .
“ <unk> what I was about to say , ” cried Danglars .
“ Now what is vague is doubtful ; and it was a wise man who said , ‘ when in doubt , keep out . ’ ” “ <unk> to say , ” <unk> Monte Cristo , “ that however Thomson &amp; French may be inclined to commit <unk> of <unk> and folly , the Baron Danglars is not disposed to follow their example . ” “ Not at all . ” “ <unk> enough ; <unk> Thomson &amp; French set no bounds to their engagements while those of M. Danglars have their <unk> ; he is a wise man , according to his own showing . ” “ Monsieur , ” replied the banker , drawing himself up with a haughty air , “ the extent of my resources has never yet been questioned . ” “ It seems , then , reserved for me , ” said Monte Cristo coldly , “ to be the first to do so . ” “ By what right , sir ? ” “ By right of the objections you have raised , and the <unk> you have demanded , which certainly must have some motive . ” Once more Danglars bit his lips .
It was the second time he had been <unk> , and this time on his own ground .
His forced politeness sat <unk> upon him , and approached almost to <unk> .
Monte Cristo on the contrary , preserved a graceful <unk> of <unk> , <unk> by a certain degree of simplicity he could assume at pleasure , and thus possessed the advantage .
“ Well , sir , ” resumed Danglars , after a brief silence , “ I will endeavor to make myself understood , by <unk> you to inform me for what sum you propose to draw upon me ? ” “ Why , truly , ” replied Monte Cristo , determined not to lose an <unk> of the ground he had gained , “ my reason for <unk> an ‘ <unk> ’ credit was precisely because I did not know how much money I might need . ” The banker thought the time had come for him to take the upper hand .
So throwing himself back in his armchair , he said , with an <unk> and <unk> air : “ Let me beg of you not to hesitate in <unk> your wishes ; you will then be convinced that the resources of the house of Danglars , however limited , are still equal to meeting the <unk> demands ; and were you even to require a million — — ” “ I beg your pardon , ” <unk> Monte Cristo .
“ I said a million , ” replied Danglars , with the confidence of ignorance .
“ But could I do with a million ? ” retorted the count .
“ My dear sir , if a trifle like that could suffice me , I should never have given myself the trouble of opening an account .
A million ?
Excuse my smiling when you speak of a sum I am in the habit of carrying in my pocket-book or <unk> . ” And with these words Monte Cristo took from his pocket a small case containing his <unk> , and drew forth two orders on the <unk> for <unk> francs each , <unk> at sight to the <unk> .
A man like Danglars was wholly <unk> to any <unk> method of <unk> .
The effect of the present <unk> was <unk> ; he trembled and was on the verge of <unk> .
The <unk> of his eyes , as he gazed at Monte Cristo <unk> horribly .
“ Come , come , ” said Monte Cristo , “ confess <unk> that you have not perfect confidence in Thomson &amp; French .
I understand , and <unk> that such might be the case , I took , in spite of my ignorance of affairs , certain precautions .
See , here are two similar letters to that you have yourself received ; one from the house of <unk> &amp; <unk> of <unk> , to Baron <unk> , the other drawn by <unk> of London , upon M. <unk> .
Now , sir , you have but to say the word , and I will spare you all uneasiness by presenting my letter of credit to one or other of these two <unk> . ” The blow had struck home , and Danglars was entirely <unk> ; with a trembling hand he took the two letters from the count , who held them <unk> between finger and <unk> , and proceeded to <unk> the <unk> , with a <unk> that the count might have regarded as <unk> , had it not suited his present purpose to <unk> the banker .
“ Oh , sir , ” said Danglars , after he had convinced himself of the <unk> of the documents he held , and rising as if to salute the power of gold <unk> in the man before him , — “ three letters of <unk> credit !
I can be no longer <unk> , but you must pardon me , my dear count , for <unk> to some degree of astonishment . ” “ Nay , ” answered Monte Cristo , with the most <unk> air , “ ’ <unk> not for such trifling <unk> as these that your <unk> house is to be <unk> .
Then , you can let me have some money , can you not ? ” “ Whatever you say , my dear count ; I am at your orders . ” “ Why , ” replied Monte Cristo , “ since we <unk> understand each other — for such I presume is the case ? ” Danglars bowed <unk> .
“ You are quite sure that not a <unk> doubt or suspicion <unk> in your mind ? ” “ Oh , my dear count , ” exclaimed Danglars , “ I never for an instant entertained such a feeling towards you . ” “ No , you merely wished to be convinced , nothing more ; but now that we have come to so clear an understanding , and that all distrust and suspicion are laid at rest , we may as well fix a sum as the probable <unk> of the first year , suppose we say six millions to — — ” “ Six millions ! ” <unk> Danglars — “ so be it . ” “ Then , if I should require more , ” continued Monte Cristo in a <unk> manner , “ why , of course , I should draw upon you ; but my present intention is not to remain in France more than a year , and during that period I scarcely think I shall <unk> the sum I mentioned .
However , we shall see .
Be kind enough , then , to send me <unk> francs tomorrow .
I shall be at home till midday , or if not , I will leave a receipt with my steward . ” “ The money you desire shall be at your house by ten o ’ clock tomorrow morning , my dear count , ” replied Danglars .
“ How would you like to have it ?
in gold , silver , or notes ? ” “ Half in gold , and the other half in bank-notes , if you please , ” said the count , rising from his seat .
“ I must confess to you , count , ” said Danglars , “ that I have hitherto imagined myself acquainted with the degree of all the great <unk> of Europe , and still wealth such as yours has been wholly unknown to me .
May I presume to ask whether you have long possessed it ? ” “ It has been in the family a very long while , ” returned Monte Cristo , “ a sort of treasure <unk> forbidden to be touched for a certain period of years , during which the <unk> interest has <unk> the capital .
The period appointed by the <unk> for the disposal of these riches occurred only a short time ago , and they have only been employed by me within the last few years .
Your ignorance on the subject , therefore , is easily <unk> for .
However , you will be better informed as to me and my <unk> ere long . ” And the count , while <unk> these latter words , accompanied them with one of those ghastly smiles that used to strike terror into poor Franz d ’ Épinay .
“ With your <unk> , and means of <unk> them , ” continued Danglars , “ you will <unk> a splendor that must <unk> put us poor miserable <unk> quite in the shade .
If I mistake not you are an <unk> of <unk> , at least I judged so from the attention you appeared to be <unk> on mine when I entered the room .
If you will permit me , I shall be happy to show you my picture gallery , composed entirely of works by the ancient masters — <unk> as such .
Not a modern picture among them .
I cannot endure the modern school of <unk> . ” “ You are perfectly right in <unk> to them , for this one great fault — that they have not yet had time to become old . ” “ Or will you allow me to show you several fine <unk> by <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> ? — all foreign <unk> , for , as you may perceive , I think but very <unk> of our French <unk> . ” “ You have a right to be unjust to them , monsieur ; they are your <unk> . ” “ But all this may come later , when we shall be better known to each other .
For the present , I will confine myself ( if perfectly agreeable to you ) to <unk> you to the <unk> Danglars — excuse my impatience , my dear count , but a <unk> like you is almost like a member of the family . ” Monte Cristo bowed , in sign that he accepted the <unk> honor ; Danglars rang and was answered by a servant in a <unk> <unk> .
“ Is the baroness at home ? ” inquired Danglars .
“ Yes , my lord , ” answered the man .
“ And alone ? ” “ No , my lord , madame has visitors . ” “ Have you any objection to meet any persons who may be with madame , or do you desire to preserve a strict _ <unk> _ ? ” “ No , indeed , ” replied Monte Cristo with a smile , “ I do not <unk> to myself the right of so doing . ” “ And who is with madame ? — M.
Debray ? ” inquired Danglars , with an air of indulgence and <unk> that made Monte Cristo smile , acquainted as he was with the secrets of the banker ’ s domestic life .
“ Yes , my lord , ” replied the servant , “ M.
Debray is with madame . ” Danglars nodded his head ; then , turning to Monte Cristo , said , “ M.
Lucien Debray is an old friend of ours , and private secretary to the <unk> of the <unk> .
As for my wife , I must tell you , she lowered herself by marrying me , for she belongs to one of the most ancient families in France .
Her <unk> name was De <unk> , and her first husband was Colonel the Marquis of <unk> . ” “ I have not the honor of knowing Madame Danglars ; but I have already met M. Lucien Debray . ” “ Ah , indeed ? ” said Danglars ; “ and where was that ? ” “ At the house of M. de Morcerf . ” “ Ah !
you are acquainted with the young viscount , are you ? ” “ We were together a good deal during the Carnival at Rome . ” “ True , true , ” cried Danglars .
“ Let me see ; have I not heard talk of some strange adventure with bandits or thieves hid in ruins , and of his having had a <unk> escape ?
I forget how , but I know he used to amuse my wife and daughter by telling them about it after his return from Italy . ” “ Her ladyship is waiting to receive you , gentlemen , ” said the servant , who had gone to inquire the pleasure of his mistress .
“ With your permission , ” said Danglars , bowing , “ I will <unk> you , to show you the way . ” “ By all means , ” replied Monte Cristo ; “ I follow you . ” Chapter <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> The baron , followed by the count , traversed a long series of apartments , in which the <unk> <unk> were heavy <unk> and the <unk> of <unk> wealth , until he reached the <unk> of Madame Danglars — a small <unk> room , hung with pink satin , covered with white <unk> <unk> .
The chairs were of ancient <unk> and <unk> ; over the doors were painted <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , after the style and manner of <unk> ; and at each side pretty <unk> in <unk> , <unk> well with the <unk> of this charming apartment , the only one throughout the great <unk> in which any <unk> taste prevailed .
The truth was , it had been entirely <unk> in the plan arranged and followed out by M. Danglars and his <unk> , who had been selected to aid the baron in the great work of improvement <unk> because he was the most fashionable and celebrated <unk> of the day .
The <unk> of the <unk> had then been left entirely to Madame Danglars and Lucien Debray .
M. Danglars , however , while <unk> a great admiration for the antique , as it was understood during the time of the <unk> , entertained the most sovereign contempt for the simple elegance of his wife ’ s favorite <unk> , where , by the way , he was never permitted to <unk> , unless , indeed , he <unk> his own appearance by <unk> in some more agreeable visitor than himself ; and even then he had rather the air and manner of a person who was himself introduced , than that of being the <unk> of another , his reception being <unk> or <unk> , in proportion as the person who accompanied him chanced to please or <unk> the baroness .
Madame Danglars ( who , although past the first <unk> of youth , was still <unk> handsome ) was now seated at the <unk> , a most <unk> piece of cabinet and <unk> work , while Lucien Debray , standing before a small <unk> , was turning over the pages of an <unk> .
Lucien had found time , <unk> to the count ’ s arrival , to relate many particulars respecting him to Madame Danglars .
It will be remembered that Monte Cristo had made a lively impression on the minds of all the party assembled at the breakfast given by Albert de Morcerf ; and although Debray was not in the habit of <unk> to such feelings , he had never been able to shake off the powerful influence excited in his mind by the <unk> look and manner of the count , consequently the description given by Lucien to the baroness bore the <unk> <unk> of his own <unk> imagination .
<unk> excited by the wonderful stories related of the count by de Morcerf , it is no wonder that Madame Danglars eagerly listened to , and fully <unk> , all the additional circumstances <unk> by Debray .
This <unk> at the <unk> and over the <unk> was only a little <unk> adopted by way of precaution .
A most gracious welcome and unusual smile were bestowed on M. Danglars ; the count , in return for his <unk> bow , received a formal though graceful <unk> , while Lucien exchanged with the count a sort of distant <unk> , and with Danglars a free and easy <unk> .
“ <unk> , ” said Danglars , “ give me leave to present to you the Count of Monte Cristo , who has been most warmly recommended to me by my <unk> at Rome .
I need but mention one fact to make all the ladies in Paris court his notice , and that is , that he has come to take up his abode in Paris for a year , during which brief period he <unk> to spend six millions of money .
That means balls , <unk> , and lawn parties without end , in all of which I trust the count will remember us , as he may depend upon it we shall him , in our own humble <unk> . ” In spite of the <unk> <unk> and <unk> of this address , Madame Danglars could not <unk> gazing with considerable interest on a man capable of <unk> six millions in twelve months , and who had selected Paris for the scene of his <unk> <unk> .
“ And when did you arrive here ? ” inquired she .
“ <unk> morning , madame . ” “ <unk> , as usual , I presume , from the extreme end of the <unk> ?
Pardon me — at least , such I have heard is your custom . ” “ Nay , madame .
This time I have merely come from <unk> . ” “ You have selected a most <unk> moment for your first visit .
Paris is a horrible place in summer .
<unk> , parties , and _ <unk> _ are over ; the Italian <unk> is in London ; the French <unk> everywhere except in Paris .
As for the <unk> <unk> , you know , of course , that it is <unk> .
The only <unk> left us are the indifferent <unk> at the <unk> and <unk> .
Do you propose entering any horses at either of these <unk> , count ? ” “ I shall do whatever they do at Paris , madame , if I have the good fortune to find someone who will <unk> me into the <unk> ideas of amusement . ” “ Are you fond of horses , count ? ” “ I have passed a considerable part of my life in the East , madame , and you are doubtless aware that the <unk> value only two things — the fine <unk> of their horses and the beauty of their women . ” “ Nay , count , ” said the baroness , “ it would have been somewhat more gallant to have placed the ladies first . ” “ You see , madame , how rightly I spoke when I said I required a <unk> to guide me in all my <unk> and <unk> here . ” At this instant the favorite attendant of Madame Danglars entered the <unk> ; approaching her mistress , she spoke some words in an <unk> .
Madame Danglars turned very pale , then exclaimed : “ I cannot believe it ; the thing is impossible . ” “ I assure you , madame , ” replied the woman , “ it is as I have said . ” <unk> impatiently towards her husband , Madame Danglars demanded , “ Is this true ? ” “ Is what true , madame ? ” inquired Danglars , <unk> agitated .
“ What my maid tells me . ” “ But what does she tell you ? ” “ That when my coachman was about to <unk> the horses to my carriage , he discovered that they had been removed from the <unk> without his knowledge .
I desire to know what is the meaning of this ? ” “ Be kind enough , madame , to listen to me , ” said Danglars .
“ Oh , yes ; I will listen , monsieur , for I am most curious to hear what explanation you will give .
These two gentlemen shall decide between us ; but , first , I will state the case to them .
Gentlemen , ” continued the baroness , “ among the ten horses in the <unk> of Baron Danglars , are two that belong <unk> to me — a pair of the <unk> and most <unk> creatures to be found in Paris .
But to you , at least , M. Debray , I need not give a further description , because to you my beautiful pair of <unk> <unk> were well known .
Well , I had promised Madame de Villefort the <unk> of my carriage to drive tomorrow to the <unk> ; but when my coachman goes to fetch the <unk> from the <unk> they are gone — positively gone .
No doubt M. Danglars has <unk> them to the selfish consideration of <unk> some thousands of <unk> francs .
Oh , what a <unk> crew they are , these <unk> <unk> ! ” “ Madame , ” replied Danglars , “ the horses were not sufficiently quiet for you ; they were scarcely four years old , and they made me extremely uneasy on your account . ” “ <unk> , ” retorted the baroness ; “ you could not have entertained any alarm on the subject , because you are perfectly well aware that I have had for a month in my service the very best coachman in Paris .
But , perhaps , you have disposed of the coachman as well as the horses ? ” “ My dear love , pray do not say any more about them , and I promise you another pair exactly like them in appearance , only more quiet and steady . ” The baroness shrugged her shoulders with an air of ineffable contempt , while her husband , <unk> not to observe this <unk> gesture , turned towards Monte Cristo and said , — “ Upon my word , count , I am quite sorry not to have met you sooner .
You are setting up an establishment , of course ? ” “ Why , yes , ” replied the count .
“ I should have liked to have made you the offer of these horses .
I have almost given them away , as it is ; but , as I before said , I was anxious to get rid of them upon any terms .
They were only fit for a young man . ” “ I am much obliged by your kind intentions towards me , ” said Monte Cristo ; “ but this morning I purchased a very excellent pair of <unk> , and I do not think they were dear .
There they are .
Come , M. Debray , you are a <unk> , I believe , let me have your opinion upon them . ” As Debray walked towards the window , Danglars approached his wife .
“ I could not tell you before others , ” said he in a low tone , “ the reason of my parting with the horses ; but a most enormous price was offered me this morning for them .
Some madman or fool , bent upon <unk> himself as fast as he can , actually sent his steward to me to purchase them at any cost ; and the fact is , I have gained <unk> francs by the <unk> of them .
Come , don ’ t look so angry , and you shall have <unk> francs of the money to do what you like with , and Eugénie shall have <unk> .
There , what do you think now of the affair ?
<unk> ’ t I right to part with the horses ? ” Madame Danglars <unk> her husband with a look of <unk> contempt .
“ Great heavens ? ” suddenly exclaimed Debray .
“ What is it ? ” asked the baroness .
“ I cannot be mistaken ; there are your horses !
The very animals we were speaking of , <unk> to the count ’ s carriage ! ” “ My <unk> <unk> ? ” demanded the baroness , <unk> to the window .
“ ’ Tis indeed they ! ” said she .
Danglars looked absolutely stupefied .
“ How very singular , ” cried Monte Cristo with <unk> astonishment .
“ I cannot believe it , ” murmured the banker .
Madame Danglars whispered a few words in the ear of Debray , who approached Monte Cristo , saying , “ The baroness wishes to know what you paid her husband for the horses . ” “ I scarcely know , ” replied the count ; “ it was a little surprise prepared for me by my steward , and cost me — well , somewhere about <unk> francs . ” Debray conveyed the count ’ s reply to the baroness .
Poor Danglars looked so <unk> and <unk> that Monte Cristo assumed a <unk> air towards him .
“ See , ” said the count , “ how very <unk> women are .
Your kind attention , in providing for the safety of the baroness by <unk> of the horses , does not seem to have made the least impression on her .
But so it is ; a woman will often , from mere <unk> , prefer that which is dangerous to that which is safe .
<unk> , in my opinion , my dear baron , the best and <unk> way is to leave them to their fancies , and allow them to act as they please , and then , if any mischief follows , why , at least , they have no one to blame but themselves . ” Danglars made no reply ; he was occupied in <unk> of the coming scene between himself and the baroness , whose <unk> brow , like that of <unk> <unk> , <unk> a storm .
Debray , who perceived the <unk> clouds , and felt no desire to witness the <unk> of Madame Danglars ’ rage , suddenly recollected an <unk> , which compelled him to take his leave ; while Monte Cristo , unwilling by <unk> his stay to destroy the advantages he hoped to obtain , made a farewell bow and departed , leaving Danglars to endure the angry <unk> of his wife .
<unk> “ <unk> , ” murmured Monte Cristo to himself , as he came away .
“ All has gone according to my wishes .
The domestic peace of this family is henceforth in my hands .
Now , then , to play another <unk> , by which I shall gain the heart of both husband and wife — delightful !
Still , ” added he , “ amid all this , I have not yet been presented to Mademoiselle Eugénie Danglars , whose acquaintance I should have been glad to make .
But , ” he went on with his peculiar smile , “ I am here in Paris , and have plenty of time before me — by and by will do for that . ” With these reflections he entered his carriage and returned home .
Two hours afterwards , Madame Danglars received a most <unk> <unk> from the count , in which he <unk> her to receive back her favorite “ <unk> <unk> , ” <unk> that he could not endure the idea of making his entry into the Parisian world of fashion with the knowledge that his splendid <unk> had been obtained at the price of a lovely woman ’ s <unk> .
The horses were sent back wearing the same <unk> she had seen on them in the morning ; only , by the count ’ s orders , in the centre of each <unk> that <unk> either side of their heads , had been fastened a large diamond .
To Danglars Monte Cristo also wrote , <unk> him to excuse the <unk> gift of a <unk> <unk> , and to beg the baroness to pardon the <unk> fashion adopted in the return of the horses .
During the evening , Monte Cristo quitted Paris for Auteuil , accompanied by Ali .
The following day , about three o ’ clock , a single blow struck on the <unk> summoned Ali to the presence of the count .
“ Ali , ” observed his master , as the <unk> entered the chamber , “ you have frequently explained to me how more than <unk> skilful you are in throwing the <unk> , have you not ? ” Ali drew himself up <unk> , and then returned a sign in the <unk> .
“ I thought I did not mistake .
With your <unk> you could stop an <unk> ? ” Again Ali repeated his <unk> gesture .
“ Or a tiger ? ” Ali bowed his head in <unk> of <unk> .
“ A lion even ? ” Ali sprung <unk> , <unk> the action of one throwing the <unk> , then of a <unk> lion .
“ I understand , ” said Monte Cristo ; “ you wish to tell me you have hunted the lion ? ” Ali smiled with triumphant pride as he signified that he had indeed both <unk> and captured many <unk> .
“ But do you believe you could arrest the progress of two horses rushing <unk> with <unk> fury ? ” The <unk> smiled .
“ It is well , ” said Monte Cristo .
“ Then listen to me .
<unk> long a carriage will <unk> past here , drawn by the pair of <unk> gray horses you saw me with yesterday ; now , at the risk of your own life , you must manage to stop those horses before my door . ” Ali descended to the street , and marked a straight line on the pavement immediately at the entrance of the house , and then pointed out the line he had traced to the count , who was watching him .
The count <unk> him gently on the shoulder , his usual mode of <unk> Ali , who , pleased and gratified with the commission <unk> him , walked calmly towards a <unk> stone forming the angle of the street and house , and , <unk> himself <unk> , began to smoke his <unk> , while Monte Cristo re-entered his dwelling , perfectly assured of the success of his plan .
Still , as five o ’ clock approached , and the carriage was <unk> expected by the count , the <unk> of more than common impatience and uneasiness might be observed in his manner .
He stationed himself in a room <unk> a view of the street , <unk> the chamber with <unk> steps , stopping merely to listen from time to time for the sound of approaching wheels , then to cast an anxious glance on Ali ; but the <unk> with which the <unk> <unk> forth the smoke of his <unk> proved that he at least was wholly absorbed in the enjoyment of his favorite occupation .
Suddenly a distant sound of rapidly advancing wheels was heard , and almost immediately a carriage appeared , drawn by a pair of wild , <unk> horses , while the terrified coachman strove in vain to restrain their furious speed .
In the vehicle was a young woman and a child of about seven or eight clasped in each other ’ s arms .
<unk> seemed to have deprived them even of the power of uttering a cry .
The carriage <unk> and <unk> as it flew over the rough stones , and the slightest obstacle under the wheels would have caused <unk> ; but it kept on in the middle of the road , and those who saw it pass uttered cries of terror .
Ali suddenly cast aside his <unk> , drew the <unk> from his pocket , threw it so <unk> as to catch the <unk> of the near horse in its <unk> fold , and suffered himself to be dragged on for a few steps by the violence of the shock , then the animal fell over on the <unk> , which <unk> , and therefore prevented the other horse from pursuing its way .
<unk> <unk> himself of this opportunity , the coachman leaped from his box ; but Ali had <unk> seized the <unk> of the second horse , and held them in his iron grasp , till the beast , <unk> with pain , sunk beside his companion .
All this was <unk> in much less time than is occupied in the <unk> .
The brief space had , however , been sufficient for a man , followed by a number of servants , to rush from the house before which the accident had occurred , and , as the coachman opened the door of the carriage , to take from it a lady who was convulsively <unk> the <unk> with one hand , while with the other she pressed to her bosom the young boy , who had lost consciousness .
Monte Cristo carried them both to the salon , and deposited them on a sofa .
“ <unk> yourself , madame , ” said he ; “ all danger is over . ” The woman looked up at these words , and , with a glance far more expressive than any <unk> could have been , pointed to her child , who still continued <unk> .
“ I understand the nature of your <unk> , madame , ” said the count , carefully examining the child , “ but I assure you there is not the slightest occasion for uneasiness ; your little charge has not received the least <unk> ; his <unk> is merely the effects of terror , and will soon pass . ” “ Are you quite sure you do not say so to <unk> my fears ?
See how deadly pale he is !
My child , my darling Edward ; speak to your mother — open your dear eyes and look on me once again !
Oh , sir , in pity send for a physician ; my whole fortune shall not be thought too much for the <unk> of my boy . ” With a calm smile and a gentle wave of the hand , Monte Cristo signed to the <unk> mother to lay aside her <unk> ; then , opening a <unk> that stood near , he drew forth a <unk> of <unk> glass <unk> with gold , containing a <unk> of the color of blood , of which he let fall a single drop on the child ’ s lips .
<unk> had it reached them , ere the boy , though still pale as marble , opened his eyes , and eagerly gazed around him .
At this , the delight of the mother was almost <unk> .
“ Where am I ? ” exclaimed she ; “ and to whom am I indebted for so happy a <unk> to my late dreadful alarm ? ” “ Madame , ” answered the count , “ you are under the roof of one who <unk> himself most fortunate in having been able to save you from a further <unk> of your sufferings . ” “ My wretched curiosity has brought all this about , ” pursued the lady .
“ All Paris <unk> with the <unk> of Madame Danglars ’ beautiful horses , and I had the folly to desire to know whether they really <unk> the high praise given to them . ” “ Is it possible , ” exclaimed the count with <unk> astonishment , “ that these horses belong to the baroness ? ” “ They do , indeed .
May I inquire if you are acquainted with Madame Danglars ? ” <unk> “ I have that honor ; and my happiness at your escape from the danger that threatened you is redoubled by the consciousness that I have been the unwilling and the <unk> cause of all the peril you have <unk> .
I yesterday purchased these horses of the baron ; but as the baroness evidently regretted parting with them , I ventured to send them back to her , with a request that she would <unk> me by accepting them from my hands . ” “ You are , then , doubtless , the Count of Monte Cristo , of whom <unk> has talked to me so much ? ” “ You have rightly guessed , madame , ” replied the count .
“ And I am Madame <unk> de Villefort . ” The count bowed with the air of a person who hears a name for the first time .
“ How grateful will M. de Villefort be for all your goodness ; how <unk> will he acknowledge that to you alone he <unk> the existence of his wife and child !
Most certainly , but for the <unk> assistance of your <unk> servant , this dear child and myself must both have <unk> . ” “ Indeed , I still shudder at the fearful danger you were placed in . ” “ I trust you will allow me to recompense <unk> the devotion of your man . ” “ I <unk> you , madame , ” replied Monte Cristo “ not to <unk> Ali , either by too great praise or <unk> .
I cannot allow him to <unk> the habit of expecting to be <unk> for every trifling service he may render .
Ali is my slave , and in <unk> your life he was but <unk> his duty to me . ” “ Nay , ” <unk> Madame de Villefort , on whom the <unk> style adopted by the count made a deep impression , “ nay , but consider that to preserve my life he has <unk> his own . ” “ His life , madame , belongs not to him ; it is mine , in return for my having myself saved him from death . ” Madame de Villefort made no further reply ; her mind was utterly absorbed in the contemplation of the person who , from the first instant she saw him , had made so powerful an impression on her .
During the evident <unk> of Madame de Villefort , Monte Cristo scrutinized the features and appearance of the boy she kept folded in her arms , <unk> on him the most tender <unk> .
The child was small for his age , and <unk> pale .
A mass of straight black hair , <unk> all attempts to train or <unk> it , fell over his <unk> forehead , and hung down to his shoulders , giving increased <unk> to eyes already sparkling with a youthful love of mischief and <unk> for every forbidden enjoyment .
His mouth was large , and the lips , which had not yet regained their color , were particularly thin ; in fact , the deep and <unk> look , giving a <unk> expression to the child ’ s face , belonged rather to a boy of twelve or fourteen than to one so young .
His first movement was to free himself by a violent <unk> from the <unk> arms of his mother , and to rush forward to the <unk> from whence the count had taken the <unk> of <unk> ; then , without asking permission of anyone , he proceeded , in all the <unk> of a <unk> child <unk> to restrain either <unk> or <unk> , to <unk> the <unk> out of all the bottles .
“ <unk> nothing , my little friend , ” cried the count eagerly ; “ some of those <unk> are not only dangerous to taste , but even to <unk> . ” Madame de Villefort became very pale , and , seizing her son ’ s arm , drew him anxiously toward her ; but , once satisfied of his safety , she also cast a brief but expressive glance on the <unk> , which was not lost upon the count .
At this moment Ali entered .
At sight of him Madame de Villefort uttered an expression of pleasure , and , holding the child still closer towards her , she said : “ Edward , dearest , do you see that good man ?
He has shown very great courage and resolution , for he exposed his own life to stop the horses that were running away with us , and would certainly have dashed the carriage to pieces .
Thank him , then , my child , in your very best manner ; for , had he not come to our aid , neither you nor I would have been alive to speak our thanks . ” The child <unk> out his lips and turned away his head in a <unk> manner , saying , “ He ’ s too ugly . ” <unk> The count smiled as if the child bade fair to realize his hopes , while Madame de Villefort <unk> her son with a gentleness and <unk> very far from <unk> the least idea of a fault having been committed .
“ This lady , ” said the Count , speaking to Ali in the <unk> language , “ is desirous that her son should thank you for <unk> both their lives ; but the boy <unk> , saying you are too ugly . ” Ali turned his intelligent countenance towards the boy , on whom he gazed without any apparent emotion ; but the <unk> working of the <unk> showed to the <unk> eye of Monte Cristo that the <unk> had been wounded to the heart .
“ Will you permit me to inquire , ” said Madame de Villefort , as she arose to take her leave , “ whether you usually <unk> here ? ” “ No , I do not , ” replied Monte Cristo ; “ it is a small place I have purchased quite lately .
My place of abode is No .
30 , <unk> des Champs-Élysées ; but I see you have quite recovered from your fright , and are , no doubt , desirous of returning home .
<unk> your wishes , I have desired the same horses you came with to be put to one of my carriages , and Ali , he whom you think so very ugly , ” continued he , addressing the boy with a smiling air , “ will have the honor of driving you home , while your coachman remains here to attend to the necessary <unk> of your <unk> .
As soon as that important business is concluded , I will have a pair of my own horses <unk> to convey it direct to Madame Danglars . ” “ I dare not return with those dreadful horses , ” said Madame de Villefort .
“ You will see , ” replied Monte Cristo , “ that they will be as different as possible in the hands of Ali .
With him they will be gentle and <unk> as <unk> . ” Ali had , indeed , given proof of this ; for , approaching the animals , who had been got upon their legs with considerable difficulty , he <unk> their <unk> and <unk> with a <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> , and wiped off the <unk> and <unk> that covered their mouths .
Then , <unk> a loud <unk> noise , he <unk> them well all over their bodies for several minutes ; then , <unk> by the <unk> crowd collected round the broken carriage , Ali quietly <unk> the <unk> animals to the count ’ s <unk> , took the <unk> in his hands , and mounted the box , when to the utter astonishment of those who had witnessed the <unk> spirit and <unk> speed of the same horses , he was actually compelled to apply his <unk> in no very gentle manner before he could induce them to start ; and even then all that could be obtained from the celebrated “ <unk> <unk> , ” now changed into a couple of dull , <unk> , stupid <unk> , was a slow , <unk> pace , kept up with so much difficulty that Madame de Villefort was more than two hours returning to her residence in the Faubourg <unk> .
<unk> <unk> had the first <unk> upon her marvellous escape been gone through when she wrote the following letter to Madame Danglars : — “ Dear <unk> , — I have just had a wonderful escape from the most <unk> danger , and I owe my safety to the very Count of Monte Cristo we were talking about yesterday , but whom I little expected to see today .
I remember how <unk> I laughed at what I considered your <unk> and <unk> <unk> of him ; but I have now <unk> cause to admit that your enthusiastic description of this wonderful man fell far short of his <unk> .
Your horses got as far as <unk> , when they darted forward like mad things , and <unk> away at so fearful a rate , that there seemed no other prospect for myself and my poor Edward but that of being dashed to pieces against the first object that <unk> their progress , when a <unk> man , — an <unk> , a <unk> , or a <unk> , at least a black of some nation or other — at a signal from the count , whose domestic he is , suddenly seized and stopped the <unk> animals , even at the risk of being <unk> to death himself ; and certainly he must have had a most wonderful escape .
The count then hastened to us , and took us into his house , where he speedily recalled my poor Edward to life .
He sent us home in his own carriage .
<unk> will be returned to you tomorrow .
You will find your horses in bad condition , from the results of this accident ; they seem thoroughly stupefied , as if <unk> and vexed at having been conquered by man .
The count , however , has <unk> me to assure you that two or three days ’ rest , with plenty of <unk> for their sole food during that time , will bring them back to as fine , that is as <unk> , a condition as they were in yesterday .
<unk> Adieu !
I cannot return you many thanks for the drive of yesterday ; but , after all , I ought not to blame you for the <unk> of your horses , more especially as it procured me the pleasure of an introduction to the Count of Monte Cristo , — and certainly that illustrious personage , apart from the millions he is said to be so very anxious to <unk> of , seemed to me one of those <unk> interesting <unk> I , for one , delight in <unk> at any risk , even if it were to <unk> another drive to the <unk> behind your horses .
Edward endured the accident with <unk> courage — he did not utter a single cry , but fell <unk> into my arms ; nor did a tear fall from his eyes after it was over .
I doubt not you will consider these <unk> the result of blind <unk> affection , but there is a soul of iron in that delicate , <unk> body .
Valentine sends many affectionate <unk> to your dear Eugénie .
I embrace you with all my heart .
<unk> de Villefort .
<unk> — Do pray <unk> some means for me to meet the Count of Monte Cristo at your house .
I must and will see him again .
I have just made M. de Villefort promise to call on him , and I hope the visit will be returned .
That night the adventure at Auteuil was talked of everywhere .
Albert related it to his mother ; Château-Renaud <unk> it at the <unk> <unk> , and Debray <unk> it at length in the <unk> of the minister ; even Beauchamp <unk> twenty lines in his journal to the relation of the count ’ s courage and gallantry , <unk> <unk> him as the greatest hero of the day in the eyes of all the <unk> members of the <unk> .
<unk> was the crowd of visitors and <unk> friends who left their names at the residence of Madame de Villefort , with the design of <unk> their visit at the right moment , of hearing from her lips all the interesting circumstances of this most romantic adventure .
As for M. de Villefort , he <unk> the <unk> of <unk> to the letter , — <unk> his dress suit , drew on a pair of white gloves , ordered the servants to attend the carriage dressed in their full <unk> , and drove that same night to No .
30 in the <unk> des Champs-Élysées .
VOLUME <unk> <unk> <unk> Chapter <unk> .
<unk> If the Count of Monte Cristo had been for a long time familiar with the ways of Parisian society , he would have <unk> better the <unk> of the step which M. de Villefort had taken .
<unk> well at court , whether the king <unk> was of the older or younger branch , whether the government was <unk> liberal , or <unk> ; looked upon by all as a man of talent , since those who have never experienced a political check are generally so regarded ; hated by many , but warmly supported by others , without being really liked by anybody , M. de Villefort held a high position in the <unk> , and <unk> his <unk> like a <unk> or a <unk> .
His drawing-room , under the <unk> influence of a young wife and a daughter by his first marriage , scarcely eighteen , was still one of the <unk> Paris <unk> where the <unk> of <unk> customs and the <unk> of <unk> <unk> were carefully <unk> .
A <unk> politeness , a strict <unk> to government principles , a profound contempt for <unk> and <unk> , a <unk> hatred of <unk> , — these were the elements of private and public life displayed by M. de Villefort .
<unk> M. de Villefort was not only a magistrate , he was almost a <unk> .
His relations with the former court , of which he always spoke with dignity and respect , made him respected by the new one , and he knew so many things , that not only was he always carefully considered , but sometimes consulted .
Perhaps this would not have been so had it been possible to get rid of M. de Villefort ; but , like the <unk> <unk> who <unk> against their sovereign , he dwelt in an <unk> <unk> .
This <unk> was his post as king ’ s attorney , all the advantages of which he <unk> with marvellous skill , and which he would not have resigned but to be made deputy , and thus to replace <unk> by opposition .
<unk> M. de Villefort made and returned very few visits .
His wife visited for him , and this was the received thing in the world , where the <unk> and <unk> <unk> of the magistrate were accepted as an excuse for what was really only calculated pride , a <unk> of <unk> superiority — in fact , the application of the <unk> , _ <unk> to think well of yourself , and the world will think well of you _ , an <unk> a hundred times more useful in society nowadays than that of the <unk> , “ <unk> <unk> , ” a knowledge for which , in our days , we have <unk> the less difficult and more <unk> science of _ knowing others _ .
To his friends M. de Villefort was a powerful protector ; to his enemies , he was a silent , but bitter <unk> ; for those who were neither the one nor the other , he was a statue of the <unk> man .
He had a haughty bearing , a look either steady and <unk> or <unk> piercing and <unk> .
Four <unk> revolutions had built and <unk> the <unk> upon which his fortune was <unk> .
M. de Villefort had the reputation of being the least curious and the least <unk> man in France .
He gave a ball every year , at which he appeared for a quarter of an hour only , — that is to say , <unk> minutes less than the king is visible at his balls .
He was never seen at the <unk> , at <unk> , or in any place of public <unk> .
<unk> , but seldom , he played at <unk> , and then care was taken to <unk> <unk> worthy of him — sometimes they were <unk> , sometimes <unk> , or sometimes a prince , or a president , or some <unk> <unk> .
Such was the man whose carriage had just now stopped before the Count of Monte Cristo ’ s door .
The valet de chambre announced M. de Villefort at the moment when the count , leaning over a large table , was <unk> on a <unk> the <unk> from St. <unk> to <unk> .
The procureur entered with the same grave and measured step he would have employed in entering a court of justice .
He was the same man , or rather the <unk> of the same man , whom we have <unk> seen as <unk> attorney at Marseilles .
Nature , according to her way , had made no <unk> in the path he had marked out for himself .
From being <unk> he had now become <unk> ; once pale , he was now yellow ; his <unk> eyes were hollow , and the gold spectacles <unk> his eyes seemed to be an <unk> portion of his face .
He dressed entirely in black , with the exception of his white <unk> , and his funeral appearance was only <unk> by the slight line of red ribbon which passed almost <unk> through his <unk> , and appeared like a <unk> of blood traced with a delicate <unk> .
Although master of himself , Monte Cristo , scrutinized with <unk> curiosity the magistrate whose salute he returned , and who , <unk> by habit , and especially <unk> as to social <unk> , was much more <unk> to look upon “ the noble stranger , ” as Monte Cristo was already called , as an <unk> in search of new fields , or an escaped criminal , rather than as a prince of the Holy See , or a <unk> of the _ <unk> and One <unk> _ .
“ Sir , ” said Villefort , in the <unk> tone assumed by <unk> in their <unk> <unk> , and of which they cannot , or will not , <unk> themselves in society , “ sir , the signal service which you yesterday rendered to my wife and son has made it a duty for me to offer you my thanks .
I have come , therefore , to discharge this duty , and to express to you my <unk> gratitude . ” And as he said this , the “ eye severe ” of the magistrate had lost nothing of its <unk> <unk> .
He spoke in a voice of the <unk> , with the <unk> <unk> of neck and shoulders which caused his <unk> to say ( as we have before observed ) that he was the living statue of the law .
“ Monsieur , ” replied the count , with a <unk> air , “ I am very happy to have been the means of <unk> a son to his mother , for they say that the sentiment of <unk> is the most holy of all ; and the good fortune which occurred to me , monsieur , might have enabled you to <unk> with a duty which , in its discharge , <unk> an undoubtedly great honor ; for I am aware that M. de Villefort is not usually <unk> of the favor which he now <unk> on me , — a favor which , however <unk> , is <unk> to the satisfaction which I have in my own consciousness . ” Villefort , astonished at this reply , which he by no means expected , started like a soldier who feels the blow <unk> at him over the <unk> he <unk> , and a <unk> of his <unk> lip indicated that from that moment he <unk> in the <unk> of his brain that the Count of Monte Cristo was by no means a highly <unk> gentleman .
He glanced around , in order to seize on something on which the conversation might turn , and seemed to fall easily on a <unk> .
He saw the <unk> which Monte Cristo had been examining when he entered , and said : “ You seem <unk> engaged , sir ?
It is a rich study for you , who , as I learn , have seen as many <unk> as are <unk> on this <unk> . ” “ Yes , sir , ” replied the count ; “ I have sought to make of the human race , taken in the mass , what you practice every day on <unk> — a <unk> study .
I have believed it was much <unk> to descend from the whole to a part than to ascend from a part to the whole .
It is an <unk> <unk> , which makes us proceed from a known to an unknown quantity , and not from an unknown to a known ; but sit down , sir , I beg of you . ” Monte Cristo pointed to a chair , which the procureur was obliged to take the trouble to move <unk> himself , while the count merely fell back into his own , on which he had been kneeling when M. Villefort entered .
Thus the count was <unk> turned towards his visitor , having his back towards the window , his elbow resting on the <unk> <unk> which furnished the <unk> of conversation for the moment , — a conversation which assumed , as in the case of the <unk> with Danglars and Morcerf , a turn <unk> to the persons , if not to the situation .
“ Ah , you <unk> , ” replied Villefort , after a moment ’ s silence , during which , like a <unk> who <unk> a powerful <unk> , he took breath ; “ well , sir , really , if , like you , I had nothing else to do , I should seek a more amusing occupation . ” “ Why , in truth , sir , ” was Monte Cristo ’ s reply , “ man is but an ugly <unk> for him who studies him through a <unk> <unk> ; but you said , I think , that I had nothing else to do .
Now , really , let me ask , sir , have you ? — do you believe you have anything to do ?
or to speak in plain terms , do you really think that what you do <unk> being called anything ? ” Villefort ’ s astonishment redoubled at this second thrust so <unk> made by his strange <unk> .
It was a long time since the magistrate had heard a <unk> so strong , or rather , to say the truth more exactly , it was the first time he had ever heard of it .
The procureur <unk> himself to reply .
“ Sir , ” he responded , “ you are a stranger , and I believe you say yourself that a portion of your life has been spent in <unk> countries , so you are not aware how human justice , so <unk> in <unk> countries , takes with us a prudent and <unk> course . ” “ Oh , yes — yes , I do , sir ; it is the _ <unk> <unk> _ of the <unk> .
I know all that , for it is with the justice of all countries especially that I have occupied myself — it is with the criminal <unk> of all nations that I have compared natural justice , and I must say , sir , that it is the law of <unk> nations , that is , the law of <unk> , that I have most frequently found to be according to the law of God . ” “ If this law were adopted , sir , ” said the procureur , “ it would greatly <unk> our legal <unk> , and in that case the <unk> would not ( as you just observed ) have much to do . ” “ It may , perhaps , come to this in time , ” observed Monte Cristo ; “ you know that human <unk> march from the <unk> to the simple , and simplicity is always perfection . ” “ In the meanwhile , ” continued the magistrate , “ our <unk> are in full force , with all their <unk> <unk> <unk> from <unk> customs , Roman laws , and Frank <unk> ; the knowledge of all which , you will agree , is not to be acquired without extended labor ; it needs <unk> study to <unk> this knowledge , and , when acquired , a strong power of brain to retain it . ” “ I agree with you entirely , sir ; but all that even you know with respect to the French <unk> , I know , not only in <unk> to that <unk> , but as <unk> the <unk> of all nations .
The English , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> laws , are as familiar to me as the French laws , and thus I was right , when I said to you , that <unk> ( you know that everything is relative , sir ) — that <unk> to what I have done , you have very little to do ; but that <unk> to all I have learned , you have yet a great deal to learn . ” “ But with what motive have you learned all this ? ” inquired Villefort , in astonishment .
Monte Cristo smiled .
“ Really , sir , ” he observed , “ I see that in spite of the reputation which you have acquired as a superior man , you look at everything from the material and vulgar view of society , beginning with man , and <unk> with man — that is to say , in the most <unk> , most narrow view which it is possible for human understanding to embrace . ” “ Pray , sir , explain yourself , ” said Villefort , more and more astonished , “ I really do — not — understand you — perfectly . ” “ I say , sir , that with the eyes fixed on the social <unk> of nations , you see only the <unk> of the <unk> , and lose sight of the sublime <unk> who makes them act ; I say that you do not recognize before you and around you any but those <unk> whose <unk> have been signed by a minister or king ; and that the men whom God has put above those <unk> , <unk> , and kings , by giving them a mission to follow out , instead of a post to fill — I say that they escape your narrow , limited field of observation .
It is thus that human weakness <unk> , from its <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
<unk> took the angel who restored him to light for an ordinary young man .
The nations took <unk> , who was <unk> to destroy them , for a <unk> similar to other <unk> , and it was necessary for both to reveal their <unk> , that they might be known and acknowledged ; one was compelled to say , ‘ I am the angel of the Lord ’ ; and the other , ‘ I am the <unk> of God , ’ in order that the divine <unk> in both might be revealed . ” “ Then , ” said Villefort , more and more amazed , and really supposing he was speaking to a <unk> or a madman , “ you consider yourself as one of those extraordinary beings whom you have mentioned ? ” “ And why not ? ” said Monte Cristo coldly .
“ Your pardon , sir , ” replied Villefort , quite <unk> , “ but you will excuse me if , when I presented myself to you , I was <unk> that I should meet with a person whose knowledge and understanding so far <unk> the usual knowledge and understanding of men .
It is not usual with us <unk> <unk> of civilization to find gentlemen like yourself , <unk> , as you are , of immense fortune — at least , so it is said — and I beg you to observe that I do not inquire , I merely repeat ; — it is not usual , I say , for such <unk> and wealthy beings to waste their time in <unk> on the state of society , in <unk> <unk> , intended at best to console those whom fate has <unk> from the <unk> of this world . ” “ Really , sir , ” retorted the count , “ have you attained the <unk> situation in which you are , without having admitted , or even without having met with <unk> ?
and do you never use your eyes , which must have acquired so much _ <unk> _ and certainty , to divine , at a glance , the kind of man by whom you are <unk> ?
Should not a magistrate be not merely the best <unk> of the law , but the most <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of his profession , a steel <unk> to search hearts , a <unk> to try the gold which in each soul is mingled with more or less of <unk> ? ” “ Sir , ” said Villefort , “ upon my word , you overcome me .
I really never heard a person speak as you do . ” “ Because you remain <unk> <unk> in a round of general conditions , and have never dared to raise your wings into those upper <unk> which God has <unk> with invisible or <unk> beings . ” “ And you allow then , sir , that <unk> exist , and that these marked and invisible beings <unk> amongst us ? ” “ Why should they not ?
Can you see the air you breathe , and yet without which you could not for a moment exist ? ” “ Then we do not see those beings to whom you <unk> ? ” “ Yes , we do ; you see them whenever God pleases to allow them to assume a material form .
You touch them , come in contact with them , speak to them , and they reply to you . ” “ Ah , ” said Villefort , smiling , “ I confess I should like to be warned when one of these beings is in contact with me . ” “ You have been served as you desire , monsieur , for you were warned just now , and I now again warn you . ” “ Then you yourself are one of these marked beings ? ” “ Yes , monsieur , I believe so ; for until now , no man has found himself in a position similar to mine .
The <unk> of kings are limited either by mountains or <unk> , or a change of manners , or an alteration of language .
My <unk> is bounded only by the world , for I am not an Italian , or a Frenchman , or a <unk> , or an <unk> , or a <unk> — I am a <unk> .
No country can say it saw my birth .
God alone knows what country will see me die .
I <unk> all customs , speak all <unk> .
You believe me to be a Frenchman , for I speak French with the same <unk> and purity as yourself .
Well , Ali , my <unk> , <unk> me to be an <unk> ; Bertuccio , my steward , takes me for a Roman ; Haydée , my slave , thinks me a Greek .
You may , therefore , comprehend , that being of no country , asking no protection from any government , <unk> no man as my brother , not one of the scruples that arrest the powerful , or the <unk> which <unk> the weak , <unk> or <unk> me .
I have only two <unk> — I will not say two <unk> , for with <unk> I <unk> even them , — they are time and distance .
There is a third , and the most terrible — that is my condition as a mortal being .
This alone can stop me in my <unk> career , before I have attained the <unk> at which I aim , for all the rest I have reduced to <unk> terms .
What men call the chances of fate — <unk> , ruin , change , circumstances — I have fully anticipated , and if any of these should <unk> me , yet it will not <unk> me .
<unk> I die , I shall always be what I am , and therefore it is that I utter the things you have never heard , even from the mouths of kings — for kings have need , and other persons have fear of you .
For who is there who does not say to himself , in a society as <unk> <unk> as ours , ‘ Perhaps some day I shall have to do with the king ’ s attorney ’ ? ” “ But can you not say that , sir ?
The moment you become an <unk> of France , you are naturally <unk> to the French law . ” “ I know it sir , ” replied Monte Cristo ; “ but when I visit a country I begin to study , by all the means which are available , the men from whom I may have anything to hope or to fear , till I know them as well as , perhaps better than , they know themselves .
It follows from this , that the king ’ s attorney , be he who he may , with whom I should have to deal , would assuredly be more embarrassed than I should . ” “ That is to say , ” replied Villefort with hesitation , “ that human nature being weak , every man , according to your <unk> , has committed faults . ” “ <unk> or crimes , ” responded Monte Cristo with a <unk> air .
“ And that you alone , amongst the men whom you do not recognize as your brothers — for you have said so , ” observed Villefort in a tone that <unk> somewhat — “ you alone are perfect . ” “ No , not perfect , ” was the count ’ s reply ; “ only <unk> , that ’ s all .
But let us leave off this strain , sir , if the tone of it is <unk> to you ; I am no more disturbed by your justice than are you by my <unk> . ” “ No , no , — by no means , ” said Villefort , who was afraid of seeming to abandon his ground .
“ No ; by your brilliant and almost sublime conversation you have elevated me above the ordinary level ; we no longer talk , we rise to <unk> .
But you know how the <unk> in their <unk> chairs , and philosophers in their <unk> , occasionally say cruel <unk> ; let us suppose for the moment that we are <unk> in a social way , or even <unk> , and I will say to you , rude as it may seem , ‘ My brother , you sacrifice greatly to pride ; you may be above others , but above you there is God . ’ ” <unk> “ <unk> us all , sir , ” was Monte Cristo ’ s <unk> , in a tone and with an <unk> so deep that Villefort <unk> shuddered .
“ I have my pride for men — <unk> always ready to <unk> everyone who would pass without crushing them under foot .
But I lay aside that pride before God , who has taken me from nothing to make me what I am . ” “ Then , count , I admire you , ” said Villefort , who , for the first time in this strange conversation , used the <unk> form to the unknown personage , whom , until now , he had only called monsieur .
“ Yes , and I say to you , if you are really strong , really superior , really <unk> , or <unk> , which you were right in saying <unk> to the same thing — then be proud , sir , for that is the characteristic of <unk> .
Yet you have <unk> some ambition . ” “ I have , sir . ” “ And what may it be ? ” “ I too , as happens to every man once in his life , have been taken by <unk> into the highest mountain in the earth , and when there he showed me all the <unk> of the world , and as he said before , so said he to me , ‘ <unk> of earth , what <unk> thou have to make thee adore me ? ’ I reflected long , for a <unk> ambition had long <unk> upon me , and then I replied , ‘ Listen , — I have always heard of Providence , and yet I have never seen him , or anything that resembles him , or which can make me believe that he exists .
I wish to be Providence myself , for I feel that the most beautiful , <unk> , most sublime thing in the world , is to recompense and <unk> . ’ <unk> bowed his head , and <unk> .
‘ You mistake , ’ he said , ‘ Providence does exist , only you have never seen him , because the child of God is as invisible as the <unk> .
You have seen nothing that resembles him , because he works by secret <unk> , and <unk> by hidden ways .
All I can do for you is to make you one of the agents of that Providence . ’ The <unk> was concluded .
I may sacrifice my soul , but what matters it ? ” added Monte Cristo .
“ If the thing were to do again , I would again do it . ” Villefort looked at Monte Cristo with extreme amazement .
“ Count , ” he inquired , “ have you any relations ? ” “ No , sir , I am alone in the world . ” “ So much the worse . ” “ Why ? ” asked Monte Cristo .
“ Because then you might witness a spectacle calculated to break down your pride .
You say you fear nothing but death ? ” “ I did not say that I feared it ; I only said that death alone could check the execution of my plans . ” “ And old age ? ” “ My end will be <unk> before I grow old . ” “ And madness ? ” “ I have been nearly mad ; and you know the <unk> , — _ <unk> <unk> in <unk> _ .
It is an <unk> of criminal law , and , consequently , you understand its full application . ” <unk> “ Sir , ” continued Villefort , “ there is something to fear besides death , old age , and madness .
For instance , there is <unk> — that <unk> which strikes but does not destroy you , and yet which brings everything to an end .
You are still yourself as now , and yet you are yourself no longer ; you who , like <unk> , verge on the <unk> , are but an <unk> mass , which , like <unk> , <unk> on the brutal ; and this is called in human <unk> , as I tell you , neither more nor less than <unk> .
Come , if so you will , count , and continue this conversation at my house , any day you may be willing to see an <unk> capable of understanding and anxious to <unk> you , and I will show you my father , M. Noirtier de Villefort , one of the most <unk> <unk> of the French Revolution ; that is to say , he had the most remarkable <unk> , <unk> by a most powerful <unk> — a man who has not , perhaps , like yourself seen all the <unk> of the earth , but who has helped to <unk> one of the greatest ; in fact , a man who believed himself , like you , one of the <unk> , not of God , but of a supreme being ; not of Providence , but of fate .
Well , sir , the <unk> of a <unk> on the <unk> of the brain has destroyed all this , not in a day , not in an hour , but in a second .
M. Noirtier , who , on the previous night , was the old <unk> , the old <unk> , the old <unk> , laughing at the <unk> , the cannon , and the <unk> — M.
Noirtier , playing with revolutions — M.
Noirtier , for whom France was a vast <unk> , from which <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> were to disappear , so that the king was <unk> — M.
Noirtier , the <unk> , was the next morning _ poor M. Noirtier _ , the helpless old man , at the tender <unk> of the <unk> creature in the household , that is , his <unk> , Valentine ; a <unk> and <unk> <unk> , in fact , living <unk> on , that time may be given for his frame to <unk> without his consciousness of its <unk> . ” “ Alas , sir , ” said Monte Cristo “ this spectacle is neither strange to my eye nor my thought .
I am something of a physician , and have , like my fellows , sought more than once for the soul in living and in dead matter ; yet , like Providence , it has remained invisible to my eyes , although present to my heart .
A hundred <unk> since <unk> , <unk> , St. <unk> , and <unk> , have made , in <unk> and <unk> , the comparison you have made , and yet I can well understand that a father ’ s sufferings may effect great changes in the mind of a son .
I will call on you , sir , since you <unk> me <unk> , for the advantage of my pride , this terrible spectacle , which must have been so great a source of sorrow to your family . ” “ It would have been so <unk> , had not God given me so large a <unk> .
In contrast with the old man , who is dragging his way to the tomb , are two children just entering into life — Valentine , the daughter by my first wife — Mademoiselle Renée de Saint-Méran — and Edward , the boy whose life you have this day saved . ” “ And what is your <unk> from this <unk> , sir ? ” inquired Monte Cristo .
“ My <unk> is , ” replied Villefort , “ that my father , led away by his passions , has committed some fault unknown to human justice , but marked by the justice of God .
That God , desirous in his mercy to <unk> but one person , has visited this justice on him alone . ” Monte Cristo with a smile on his lips , uttered in the depths of his soul a groan which would have made Villefort fly had he but heard it .
“ Adieu , sir , ” said the magistrate , who had risen from his seat ; “ I leave you , bearing a remembrance of you — a remembrance of esteem , which I hope will not be disagreeable to you when you know me better ; for I am not a man to bore my friends , as you will learn .
Besides , you have made an eternal friend of Madame de Villefort . ” The count bowed , and contented himself with seeing Villefort to the door of his cabinet , the procureur being <unk> to his carriage by two <unk> , who , on a signal from their master , followed him with every mark of attention .
When he had gone , Monte Cristo breathed a profound sigh , and said : “ <unk> of this poison , let me now seek the <unk> . ” Then <unk> his bell , he said to Ali , who entered : “ I am going to madame ’ s chamber — have the carriage ready at one o ’ clock . ” Chapter <unk> .
Haydée It will be recollected that the new , or rather old , <unk> of the Count of Monte Cristo , <unk> in the Rue <unk> , were no other than Maximilian , Julie , and Emmanuel .
The very <unk> of delight to be enjoyed in his <unk> visits — the bright , pure gleam of <unk> happiness it <unk> over the almost deadly <unk> in which he had <unk> engaged , <unk> his whole countenance with a look of ineffable joy and calmness , as , immediately after Villefort ’ s departure , his thoughts flew back to the <unk> prospect before him , of <unk> , at least , a brief <unk> from the fierce and stormy passions of his mind .
Even Ali , who had hastened to obey the Count ’ s <unk> , went forth from his master ’ s presence in <unk> amazement at the unusual animation and pleasure <unk> on features <unk> so stern and cold ; while , as though <unk> to put to flight the agreeable ideas <unk> over his patron ’ s <unk> , whatever they were , the faithful <unk> walked on <unk> towards the door , holding his breath , lest its <unk> sound should <unk> his master ’ s happy reverie .
It was noon , and Monte Cristo had set apart one hour to be passed in the apartments of Haydée , as though his <unk> spirit could not all at once admit the feeling of pure and <unk> joy , but required a <unk> succession of calm and gentle emotions to prepare his mind to receive full and perfect happiness , in the same manner as ordinary natures demand to be <unk> by degrees to the reception of strong or violent sensations .
The young Greek , as we have already said , occupied apartments wholly <unk> with those of the count .
The rooms had been fitted up in strict accordance with <unk> ideas ; the <unk> were covered with the <unk> <unk> <unk> could produce ; the walls hung with <unk> silk of the most magnificent <unk> and <unk> ; while around each chamber <unk> <unk> were placed , with <unk> of soft and <unk> <unk> , that needed only to be arranged at the pleasure or <unk> of such as sought repose .
Haydée had three French <unk> , and one who was a Greek .
The first three remained constantly in a small <unk> , ready to obey the <unk> of a small golden bell , or to receive the orders of the <unk> slave , who knew just enough French to be able to <unk> her mistress ’ s wishes to the three other <unk> ; the latter had received most <unk> instructions from Monte Cristo to treat Haydée with all the <unk> they would observe to a <unk> .
The young girl herself generally passed her time in the chamber at the farther end of her apartments .
This was a sort of <unk> , <unk> , and lighted only from the roof , which consisted of <unk> glass .
Haydée was <unk> upon soft <unk> <unk> , covered with blue satin <unk> with silver ; her head , supported by one of her <unk> <unk> arms , rested on the <unk> immediately behind her , while the other was employed in <unk> to her lips the <unk> <unk> of a rich <unk> , through whose <unk> <unk> she drew the smoke <unk> by its passage through <unk> water .
Her attitude , though perfectly natural for an <unk> woman would , in a <unk> , have been <unk> too full of <unk> <unk> after effect .
Her dress , which was that of the women of <unk> , consisted of a pair of white satin trousers , embroidered with pink roses , displaying feet so <unk> formed and so <unk> fair , that they might well have been taken for <unk> marble , had not the eye been <unk> by their movements as they constantly <unk> in and out of a pair of little <unk> with <unk> <unk> , <unk> ornamented with gold and pearls .
She wore a blue and <unk> <unk> , with long open <unk> , <unk> with silver <unk> and <unk> of pearls , and a sort of <unk> , which , closing only from the centre to the waist , exhibited the whole of the <unk> throat and upper part of the bosom ; it was fastened with three magnificent diamond <unk> .
The <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> was entirely concealed by one of the <unk> <unk> , whose brilliant <unk> and rich <unk> <unk> have rendered them so precious in the eyes of Parisian <unk> .
<unk> on one side of her head she had a small cap of <unk> silk , embroidered with pearls ; while on the other a purple rose mingled its <unk> colors with the <unk> masses of her hair , of which the <unk> was so intense that it was <unk> with blue .
The extreme beauty of the countenance , that shone forth in <unk> that <unk> the vain attempts of dress to <unk> it , was peculiarly and <unk> <unk> ; there were the large , dark , <unk> eyes , the <unk> formed nose , the <unk> lips , and <unk> teeth , that belonged to her race and country .
And , to complete the whole , Haydée was in the very <unk> and <unk> of youthful <unk> — she had not yet <unk> more than nineteen or twenty <unk> .
Monte Cristo summoned the Greek attendant , and bade her inquire whether it would be agreeable to her mistress to receive his visit .
Haydée ’ s only reply was to direct her servant by a sign to <unk> the <unk> curtain that hung before the door of her <unk> , the <unk> of the opening thus made <unk> as a sort of <unk> to the graceful <unk> presented by the young girl ’ s picturesque attitude and appearance .
As Monte Cristo approached , she leaned upon the elbow of the arm that held the <unk> , and extending to him her other hand , said , with a smile of <unk> sweetness , in the <unk> language spoken by the women of <unk> and <unk> : “ Why demand permission ere you enter ?
Are you no longer my master , or have I ceased to be your slave ? ” Monte Cristo returned her smile .
“ Haydée , ” said he , “ you well know . ” “ Why do you address me so coldly — so <unk> ? ” asked the young Greek .
“ Have I by any means displeased you ?
Oh , if so , <unk> me as you will ; but do not — do not speak to me in tones and manner so formal and <unk> . ” “ Haydée , ” replied the count , “ you know that you are now in France , and are free . ” “ <unk> to do what ? ” asked the young girl .
“ <unk> to leave me . ” “ Leave you ?
Why should I leave you ? ” “ That is not for me to say ; but we are now about to <unk> in society — to visit and be visited . ” “ I don ’ t wish to see anybody but you . ” “ And should you see one whom you could prefer , I would not be so unjust — — ” “ I have never seen anyone I preferred to you , and I have never loved anyone but you and my father . ” “ My poor child , ” replied Monte Cristo , “ that is merely because your father and myself are the only men who have ever talked to you . ” “ I don ’ t want anybody else to talk to me .
My father said I was his ‘ joy ’ — you style me your ‘ love , ’ — and both of you have called me ‘ my child . ’ ” “ Do you remember your father , Haydée ? ” The young Greek smiled .
“ He is here , and here , ” said she , touching her eyes and her heart .
“ And where am I ? ” inquired Monte Cristo <unk> .
“ You ? ” cried she , with tones of <unk> tenderness , “ you are everywhere ! ” Monte Cristo took the delicate hand of the young girl in his , and was about to raise it to his lips , when the simple child of nature hastily withdrew it , and presented her cheek .
“ You now understand , Haydée , ” said the count , “ that from this moment you are absolutely free ; that here you exercise <unk> <unk> , and are at liberty to lay aside or continue the costume of your country , as it may suit your inclination .
<unk> this <unk> you are absolute mistress of your actions , and may go abroad or remain in your apartments as may seem most agreeable to you .
A carriage <unk> your orders , and Ali and <unk> will accompany you <unk> you desire to go .
There is but one favor I would entreat of you . ” “ Speak . ” “ Guard carefully the secret of your birth .
Make no allusion to the past ; nor upon any occasion be induced to pronounce the names of your illustrious father or <unk> mother . ” “ I have already told you , my lord , that I shall see no one . ” “ It is possible , Haydée , that so perfect a <unk> , though <unk> with the habits and customs of the East , may not be <unk> in Paris .
<unk> , then , to <unk> yourself to our manner of living in these <unk> <unk> as you did to those of Rome , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> ; it may be useful to you one of these days , whether you remain here or return to the East . ” The young girl raised her <unk> eyes towards Monte Cristo as she said with touching <unk> , “ Whether _ we _ return to the East , you mean to say , my lord , do you not ? ” “ My child , ” returned Monte Cristo “ you know full well that whenever we part , it will be no fault or wish of mine ; the tree <unk> not the flower — the flower falls from the tree . ” “ My lord , ” replied Haydée , “ I never will leave you , for I am sure I could not exist without you . ” “ My poor girl , in ten years I shall be old , and you will be still young . ” “ My father had a long white beard , but I loved him ; he was sixty years old , but to me he was <unk> than all the fine <unk> I saw . ” “ Then tell me , Haydée , do you believe you shall be able to <unk> yourself to our present mode of life ? ” “ Shall I see you ? ” “ Every day . ” “ Then what do you fear , my lord ? ” “ You might find it dull . ” “ No , my lord .
In the morning , I shall rejoice in the prospect of your coming , and in the evening dwell with delight on the happiness I have enjoyed in your presence ; then too , when alone , I can call forth mighty <unk> of the past , see vast <unk> bounded only by the <unk> mountains of <unk> and <unk> .
Oh , believe me , that when three great passions , such as sorrow , love , and gratitude fill the heart , _ <unk> _ can find no place . ” “ You are a worthy daughter of <unk> , Haydée , and your charming and <unk> ideas prove well your descent from that race of <unk> who claim your country as their <unk> .
<unk> on my care to see that your youth is not <unk> , or suffered to pass away in <unk> solitude ; and of this be well assured , that if you love me as a father , I love you as a child . ” “ You are wrong , my lord .
The love I have for you is very different from the love I had for my father .
My father died , but I did not die .
If you were to die , I should die too . ” The count , with a smile of profound tenderness , extended his hand , and she carried it to her lips .
Monte Cristo , thus <unk> to the interview he proposed to hold with Morrel and his family , departed , <unk> as he went these lines of <unk> , “ <unk> is a flower of which love is the fruit ; happy is he who , after having watched its silent growth , is permitted to <unk> and call it his own . ” The carriage was prepared according to orders , and <unk> lightly into it , the count drove off at his usual rapid pace .
Chapter <unk> .
The Morrel <unk> In a very few minutes the count reached No .
7 in the Rue <unk> .
The house was of white stone , and in a small court before it were two small beds full of beautiful flowers .
In the concierge that opened the gate the count recognized Cocles ; but as he had but one eye , and that eye had become somewhat dim in the course of nine years , Cocles did not recognize the count .
The carriages that drove up to the door were compelled to turn , to avoid a <unk> that played in a basin of <unk> , — an <unk> that had excited the jealousy of the whole quarter , and had gained for the place the <unk> of _ The Little <unk> _ .
It is <unk> to add that there were gold and silver fish in the basin .
The house , with <unk> and <unk> below , had above the ground floor , two stories and <unk> .
The whole of the property , <unk> of an immense <unk> , two <unk> at the bottom of the garden , and the garden itself , had been purchased by Emmanuel , who had seen at a glance that he could make of it a <unk> <unk> .
He had reserved the house and half the garden , and building a wall between the garden and the <unk> , had let them upon <unk> with the <unk> at the bottom of the garden .
So that for a trifling sum he was as well <unk> , and as perfectly shut out from observation , as the inhabitants of the <unk> <unk> in the Faubourg St. <unk> .
The <unk> was finished in <unk> ; the salon in <unk> , and the <unk> were of blue velvet ; the bedroom was in <unk> and green damask .
There was a study for Emmanuel , who never studied , and a <unk> for Julie , who never played .
The whole of the second story was set apart for Maximilian ; it was precisely similar to his sister ’ s apartments , except that for the <unk> he had a <unk> , where he received his friends .
He was <unk> the <unk> of his horse , and smoking his <unk> at the entrance of the garden , when the count ’ s carriage stopped at the gate .
Cocles opened the gate , and Baptistin , <unk> from the box , inquired whether Monsieur and Madame <unk> and Monsieur Maximilian Morrel would see his excellency the Count of Monte Cristo .
“ The Count of Monte Cristo ? ” cried Morrel , throwing away his <unk> and <unk> to the carriage ; “ I should think we would see him .
Ah , a thousand thanks , count , for not having forgotten your promise . ” And the young officer shook the count ’ s hand so warmly , that Monte Cristo could not be mistaken as to the sincerity of his joy , and he saw that he had been expected with impatience , and was received with pleasure .
“ Come , come , ” said Maximilian , “ I will serve as your guide ; such a man as you are ought not to be introduced by a servant .
My sister is in the garden <unk> the dead roses ; my brother is reading his two papers , _ la <unk> _ and _ les <unk> _ , within six steps of her ; for wherever you see Madame <unk> , you have only to look within a circle of four <unk> and you will find M. Emmanuel , and ‘ <unk> , ’ as they say at the <unk> <unk> . ” At the sound of their steps a young woman of twenty to <unk> , dressed in a silk morning gown , and <unk> engaged in <unk> the dead leaves off a <unk> <unk> , raised her head .
This was Julie , who had become , as the clerk of the house of Thomson &amp; French had <unk> , Madame Emmanuel <unk> .
She uttered a cry of surprise at the sight of a stranger , and Maximilian began to laugh .
“ Don ’ t disturb yourself , Julie , ” said he .
“ The count has only been two or three days in Paris , but he already knows what a fashionable woman of the <unk> is , and if he does not , you will show him . ” “ Ah , monsieur , ” returned Julie , “ it is <unk> in my brother to bring you thus , but he never has any regard for his poor sister .
Penelon , Penelon ! ” An old man , who was <unk> <unk> at one of the beds , <unk> his <unk> in the earth , and approached , cap in hand , <unk> to conceal a <unk> of <unk> he had just thrust into his cheek .
A few locks of gray mingled with his hair , which was still thick and <unk> , while his <unk> features and determined glance well suited an old sailor who had <unk> the heat of the <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> .
“ I think you <unk> me , Mademoiselle Julie ? ” said he .
Penelon had still preserved the habit of calling his master ’ s daughter “ Mademoiselle Julie , ” and had never been able to change the name to Madame <unk> .
“ Penelon , ” replied Julie , “ go and inform M. Emmanuel of this gentleman ’ s visit , and Maximilian will conduct him to the salon . ” Then , turning to Monte Cristo , — “ I hope you will permit me to leave you for a few minutes , ” continued she ; and without awaiting any reply , disappeared behind a <unk> of trees , and escaped to the house by a <unk> alley .
<unk> “ I am sorry to see , ” observed Monte Cristo to Morrel , “ that I cause no small <unk> in your house . ” “ Look there , ” said Maximilian , laughing ; “ there is her husband changing his <unk> for a coat .
I assure you , you are well known in the Rue <unk> . ” “ Your family appears to be a very happy one , ” said the count , as if speaking to himself .
“ Oh , yes , I assure you , count , they want nothing that can render them happy ; they are young and cheerful , they are tenderly attached to each other , and with twenty-five thousand francs a year they fancy themselves as rich as <unk> . ” “ <unk> thousand francs is not a large sum , however , ” replied Monte Cristo , with a tone so sweet and gentle , that it went to Maximilian ’ s heart like the voice of a father ; “ but they will not be content with that .
Your <unk> is a <unk> ?
a doctor ? ” “ He was a merchant , monsieur , and had succeeded to the business of my poor father .
M. Morrel , at his death , left <unk> francs , which were divided between my sister and myself , for we were his only children .
Her husband , who , when he married her , had no other <unk> than his noble <unk> , his <unk> <unk> , and his <unk> reputation , wished to possess as much as his wife .
He <unk> and <unk> until he had <unk> <unk> francs ; six years sufficed to <unk> this object .
Oh , I assure you , sir , it was a touching spectacle to see these young creatures , destined by their talents for higher <unk> , <unk> together , and through their <unk> to change any of the customs of their paternal house , taking six years to accomplish what less <unk> people would have effected in two or three .
Marseilles <unk> with their <unk> <unk> .
At last , one day , Emmanuel came to his wife , who had just finished making up the accounts .
“ ‘ Julie , ’ said he to her , ‘ Cocles has just given me the last <unk> of a hundred francs ; that <unk> the <unk> francs we had fixed as the <unk> of our <unk> .
Can you content yourself with the small fortune which we shall possess for the future ?
Listen to me .
Our house <unk> business to the amount of a million a year , from which we <unk> an income of <unk> francs .
We can <unk> of the business , if we please , in an hour , for I have received a letter from M. <unk> , in which he offers to purchase the <unk> of the house , to <unk> with his own , for <unk> francs .
<unk> me what I had better do . ’ “ ‘ Emmanuel , ’ returned my sister , ‘ the house of Morrel can only be carried on by a Morrel .
Is it not worth <unk> francs to save our father ’ s name from the chances of evil fortune and failure ? ’ “ ‘ I thought so , ’ replied Emmanuel ; ‘ but I wished to have your advice . ’ “ ‘ This is my counsel : — Our accounts are made up and our <unk> paid ; all we have to do is to stop the issue of any more , and close our office . ’ “ This was done instantly .
It was three o ’ clock ; at a quarter past , a merchant presented himself to <unk> two <unk> ; it was a clear profit of <unk> francs .
“ ‘ Monsieur , ’ said Emmanuel , ‘ have the goodness to address yourself to M. <unk> .
We have quitted business . ’ “ ‘ How long ? ’ inquired the astonished merchant .
<unk> “ ‘ A quarter of an hour , ’ was the reply .
“ And this is the reason , monsieur , ” continued Maximilian , “ of my sister and <unk> having only <unk> francs a year . ” Maximilian had scarcely finished his story , during which the count ’ s heart had <unk> within him , when Emmanuel entered wearing a hat and coat .
He <unk> the count with the air of a man who is aware of the rank of his guest ; then , after having led Monte Cristo around the little garden , he returned to the house .
A large <unk> of <unk> <unk> , filled with flowers that loaded the air with their perfume , stood in the salon .
Julie , <unk> dressed , and her hair arranged ( she had accomplished this <unk> in less than ten minutes ) , received the count on his entrance .
The songs of the birds were heard in an <unk> hard by , and the branches of <unk> and rose <unk> formed an exquisite <unk> to the blue velvet curtains .
Everything in this charming retreat , from the <unk> of the birds to the smile of the mistress , breathed tranquillity and repose .
The count had felt the influence of this happiness from the moment he entered the house , and he remained silent and <unk> , forgetting that he was expected to <unk> the conversation , which had ceased after the first <unk> had been exchanged .
The silence became almost painful when , by a violent effort , tearing himself from his pleasing reverie : “ Madame , ” said he at length , “ I pray you to excuse my emotion , which must <unk> you who are only accustomed to the happiness I meet here ; but <unk> is so new a sight to me , that I could never be weary of looking at yourself and your husband . ” “ We are very happy , monsieur , ” replied Julie ; “ but we have also known unhappiness , and few have ever <unk> more bitter sufferings than ourselves . ” The count ’ s features displayed an expression of the most intense curiosity .
“ Oh , all this is a family history , as Château-Renaud told you the other day , ” observed Maximilian .
“ This humble picture would have but little interest for you , accustomed as you are to behold the pleasures and the misfortunes of the wealthy and <unk> ; but such as we are , we have experienced bitter sorrows . ” “ And God has poured <unk> into your wounds , as he does into those of all who are in <unk> ? ” said Monte Cristo <unk> .
“ Yes , count , ” returned Julie , “ we may indeed say he has , for he has done for us what he <unk> only to his chosen ; he sent us one of his angels . ” The count ’ s cheeks became scarlet , and he <unk> , in order to have an excuse for putting his handkerchief to his mouth .
“ Those born to wealth , and who have the means of <unk> every wish , ” said Emmanuel , “ know not what is the real happiness of life , just as those who have been tossed on the stormy waters of the ocean on a few <unk> planks can alone realize the <unk> of fair weather . ” Monte Cristo rose , and without making any answer ( for the <unk> of his voice would have betrayed his emotion ) walked up and down the apartment with a slow step .
“ Our <unk> makes you smile , count , ” said Maximilian , who had followed him with his eyes .
“ No , no , ” returned Monte Cristo , pale as death , pressing one hand on his heart to still its <unk> , while with the other he pointed to a <unk> cover , beneath which a <unk> purse lay on a black velvet <unk> .
“ I was <unk> what could be the <unk> of this purse , with the paper at one end and the large diamond at the other . ” “ Count , ” replied Maximilian , with an air of gravity , “ those are our most precious family treasures . ” “ The stone seems very brilliant , ” answered the count .
“ Oh , my brother does not <unk> to its value , although it has been <unk> at <unk> francs ; he means , that the <unk> contained in this purse are the <unk> of the angel I spoke of just now . ” “ This I do not comprehend ; and yet I may not ask for an explanation , madame , ” replied Monte Cristo bowing .
“ Pardon me , I had no intention of <unk> an <unk> . ” “ <unk> , — oh , you make us happy by giving us an excuse for <unk> on this subject .
If we wanted to conceal the noble action this purse <unk> , we should not <unk> it thus to view .
Oh , would we could relate it everywhere , and to everyone , so that the emotion of our unknown benefactor might reveal his presence . ” “ Ah , really , ” said Monte Cristo in a <unk> voice .
“ Monsieur , ” returned Maximilian , raising the glass cover , and <unk> <unk> the <unk> purse , “ this has touched the hand of a man who saved my father from suicide , us from ruin , and our name from shame and disgrace , — a man by whose <unk> <unk> we poor children , <unk> to want and wretchedness , can at present hear everyone <unk> our happy lot .
This letter ” ( as he spoke , Maximilian drew a letter from the purse and gave it to the count ) — “ this letter was written by him the day that my father had taken a desperate resolution , and this diamond was given by the generous unknown to my sister as her <unk> . ” Monte Cristo opened the letter , and read it with an indescribable feeling of delight .
It was the letter written ( as our <unk> know ) to Julie , and signed “ Sinbad the <unk> . ” “ <unk> you say , is the man who rendered you this service — unknown to you ? ” “ Yes ; we have never had the happiness of pressing his hand , ” continued Maximilian .
“ We have <unk> Heaven in vain to grant us this favor , but the whole affair has had a mysterious meaning that we cannot comprehend — we have been guided by an invisible hand , — a hand as powerful as that of an <unk> . ” “ Oh , ” cried Julie , “ I have not lost all hope of some day <unk> that hand , as I now kiss the purse which he has touched .
Four years ago , Penelon was at <unk> — Penelon , count , is the old sailor you saw in the garden , and who , from <unk> , has become gardener — Penelon , when he was at <unk> , saw on the quay an Englishman , who was on the point of <unk> on board a yacht , and he recognized him as the person who called on my father the fifth of June , <unk> , and who wrote me this letter on the fifth of September .
He felt convinced of his identity , but he did not venture to address him . ” “ An Englishman , ” said Monte Cristo , who grew uneasy at the attention with which Julie looked at him .
“ An Englishman you say ? ” “ Yes , ” replied Maximilian , “ an Englishman , who represented himself as the <unk> clerk of the house of Thomson &amp; French , at Rome .
It was this that made me start when you said the other day , at M. de Morcerf ’ s , that <unk> Thomson &amp; French were your <unk> .
That happened , as I told you , in <unk> .
For God ’ s sake , tell me , did you know this Englishman ? ” “ But you tell me , also , that the house of Thomson &amp; French have constantly denied having rendered you this service ? ” “ Yes . ” “ Then is it not probable that this Englishman may be someone who , grateful for a kindness your father had shown him , and which he himself had forgotten , has taken this method of <unk> the <unk> ? ” “ Everything is possible in this affair , even a miracle . ” “ What was his name ? ” asked Monte Cristo .
“ He gave no other name , ” answered Julie , looking earnestly at the count , “ than that at the end of his letter — ‘ Sinbad the <unk> . ’ ” “ Which is evidently not his real name , but a <unk> one . ” Then , <unk> that Julie was struck with the sound of his voice : “ Tell me , ” continued he , “ was he not about my height , perhaps a little <unk> , with his chin <unk> , as it were , in a high cravat ; his coat closely <unk> up , and constantly taking out his <unk> ? ” “ Oh , do you then know him ? ” cried Julie , whose eyes <unk> with joy .
“ No , ” returned Monte Cristo “ I only guessed .
I knew a Lord Wilmore , who was constantly doing actions of this kind . ” “ Without <unk> himself ? ” “ He was an eccentric being , and did not believe in the existence of gratitude . ” “ Oh , Heaven , ” exclaimed Julie , <unk> her hands , “ in what did he believe , then ? ” <unk> “ He did not credit it at the period which I knew him , ” said Monte Cristo , touched to the heart by the accents of Julie ’ s voice ; “ but , perhaps , since then he has had proofs that gratitude does exist . ” “ And do you know this gentleman , monsieur ? ” inquired Emmanuel .
“ Oh , if you do know him , ” cried Julie , “ can you tell us where he is — where we can find him ?
Maximilian — Emmanuel — if we do but discover him , he must believe in the gratitude of the heart ! ” Monte Cristo felt tears start into his eyes , and he again walked hastily up and down the room .
“ In the name of Heaven , ” said Maximilian , “ if you know anything of him , tell us what it is . ” “ Alas , ” cried Monte Cristo , <unk> to <unk> his emotion , “ if Lord Wilmore was your unknown benefactor , I fear you will never see him again .
I parted from him two years ago at <unk> , and he was then on the point of setting out for the most <unk> <unk> ; so that I fear he will never return . ” “ Oh , monsieur , this is cruel of you , ” said Julie , much affected ; and the young lady ’ s eyes <unk> with tears .
“ Madame , ” replied Monte Cristo gravely , and gazing earnestly on the two <unk> pearls that <unk> down Julie ’ s cheeks , “ had Lord Wilmore seen what I now see , he would become attached to life , for the tears you shed would <unk> him to mankind ; ” and he held out his hand to Julie , who gave him hers , carried away by the look and accent of the count .
“ But , ” continued she , “ Lord Wilmore had a family or friends , he must have known someone , can we not — — ” “ Oh , it is useless to inquire , ” returned the count ; “ perhaps , after all , he was not the man you seek for .
He was my friend : he had no secrets from me , and if this had been so he would have <unk> in me . ” “ And he told you nothing ? ” “ Not a word . ” “ Nothing that would lead you to suppose ? ” “ Nothing . ” “ And yet you spoke of him at once . ” “ Ah , in such a case one <unk> — — ” “ Sister , sister , ” said Maximilian , coming to the count ’ s aid , “ monsieur is quite right .
<unk> what our excellent father so often told us , ‘ It was no Englishman that thus saved us . ’ ” Monte Cristo started .
“ What did your father tell you , M. Morrel ? ” said he eagerly .
“ My father thought that this action had been <unk> performed — he believed that a benefactor had <unk> from the grave to save us .
Oh , it was a touching <unk> , monsieur , and although I did not myself believe it , I would not for the world have destroyed my father ’ s faith .
How often did he <unk> over it and pronounce the name of a dear friend — a friend lost to him forever ; and on his <unk> , when the near approach of eternity seemed to have <unk> his mind with <unk> light , this thought , which had until then been but a doubt , became a conviction , and his last words were , ‘ Maximilian , it was Edmond Dantès ! ’ ” At these words the count ’ s <unk> , which had for some time been increasing , became alarming ; he could not speak ; he looked at his watch like a man who has forgotten the hour , said a few hurried words to Madame <unk> , and pressing the hands of Emmanuel and Maximilian , — “ Madame , ” said he , “ I trust you will allow me to visit you occasionally ; I value your friendship , and feel grateful to you for your welcome , for this is the first time for many years that I have thus yielded to my feelings ; ” and he hastily quitted the apartment .
“ This Count of Monte Cristo is a strange man , ” said Emmanuel .
“ Yes , ” answered Maximilian , “ but I feel sure he has an excellent heart , and that he likes us . ” “ His voice went to my heart , ” observed Julie ; “ and two or three times I fancied that I had heard it before . ” Chapter <unk> .
<unk> and <unk> About <unk> of the way along the Faubourg <unk> , and in the rear of one of the most <unk> <unk> in this rich neighborhood , where the various houses <unk> with each other for elegance of design and <unk> of construction , extended a large garden , where the <unk> <unk> raised their heads high above the walls in a solid <unk> , and with the coming of every spring scattered a <unk> of delicate pink and white <unk> into the large stone <unk> that stood upon the two square <unk> of a <unk> <unk> iron gate , that <unk> from the time of Louis <unk> .
This noble entrance , however , in spite of its striking appearance and the graceful effect of the <unk> planted in the two <unk> , as they <unk> their <unk> leaves in the wind and <unk> the eye with their scarlet <unk> , had fallen into utter <unk> .
The <unk> of the <unk> had many years before thought it best to confine themselves to the possession of the house itself , with its <unk> planted courtyard , opening into the Faubourg <unk> , and to the garden shut in by this gate , which formerly communicated with a fine <unk> of about an <unk> .
For the <unk> of <unk> drew a line , or in other words projected a street , at the farther side of the <unk> .
The street was laid out , a name was chosen and posted up on an iron plate , but before construction was begun , it occurred to the <unk> of the property that a handsome sum might be obtained for the ground then devoted to <unk> and <unk> , by building along the line of the proposed street , and so making it a branch of communication with the Faubourg <unk> itself , one of the most important <unk> in the city of Paris .
In matters of <unk> , however , though “ man <unk> , ” yet “ money <unk> . ” From some such difficulty the <unk> named street died almost in birth , and the <unk> of the <unk> , having paid a high price for it , and being quite unable to find anyone willing to take his <unk> off his hands without a considerable loss , yet still <unk> to the belief that at some future day he should obtain a sum for it that would <unk> him , not only for his past <unk> , but also the interest upon the capital locked up in his new <unk> , contented himself with letting the ground <unk> to some <unk> , at a <unk> <unk> of <unk> francs .
And so , as we have said , the iron gate leading into the <unk> had been closed up and left to the <unk> , which bade fair before long to eat off its hinges , while to prevent the <unk> glances of the <unk> and <unk> of the ground from <unk> to <unk> the <unk> enclosure belonging to the <unk> , the gate had been <unk> up to a height of six feet .
True , the planks were not so closely <unk> but that a hasty <unk> might be obtained through their <unk> ; but the strict <unk> and <unk> <unk> of the inhabitants of the house left no grounds for <unk> that advantage would be taken of that circumstance .
<unk> seemed , however , to have been abandoned in the deserted <unk> ; and where <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> had once <unk> , a <unk> <unk> of <unk> alone bore evidence of its being <unk> worthy of <unk> .
A small , low door gave <unk> from the <unk> space we have been <unk> into the projected street , the ground having been abandoned as <unk> by its various <unk> , and had now fallen so completely in general <unk> as to return not even the <unk> per <unk> it had <unk> paid .
Towards the house the <unk> we have before mentioned rose high above the wall , without in any way <unk> the growth of other <unk> <unk> and flowers that eagerly dressed forward to fill up the <unk> <unk> , as though <unk> their right to enjoy the <unk> of light and air .
At one corner , where the <unk> became so thick as almost to shut out day , a large stone bench and <unk> <unk> <unk> indicated that this <unk> spot was either in general favor or particular use by some <unk> of the house , which was <unk> <unk> through the <unk> mass of <unk> that <unk> concealed it , though situated but a hundred paces off .
<unk> had selected this retired portion of the grounds as the <unk> of a walk , or as a place for meditation , was <unk> <unk> in the choice by the absence of all <unk> , the cool , <unk> shade , the screen it afforded from the <unk> rays of the sun , that found no entrance there even during the burning days of <unk> summer , the <unk> and <unk> <unk> of birds , and the entire <unk> from either the noise of the street or the <unk> of the <unk> .
On the evening of one of the <unk> days spring had yet bestowed on the inhabitants of Paris , might be seen <unk> thrown upon the stone bench , a book , a <unk> , and a <unk> , from which hung a partly embroidered <unk> handkerchief , while at a little distance from these <unk> was a young woman , standing close to the iron gate , endeavoring to <unk> something on the other side by means of the <unk> in the planks , — the <unk> of her attitude and the fixed gaze with which she seemed to seek the object of her wishes , <unk> how much her feelings were interested in the matter .
At that instant the little <unk> leading from the waste ground to the street was <unk> opened , and a tall , powerful young man appeared .
He was dressed in a common gray blouse and velvet cap , but his carefully arranged hair , beard and <unk> , all of the <unk> and <unk> black , ill <unk> with his <unk> <unk> .
After casting a rapid glance around him , in order to assure himself that he was <unk> , he entered by the small gate , and , carefully closing and <unk> it after him , proceeded with a hurried step towards the barrier .
At the sight of him she expected , though probably not in such a costume , the young woman started in terror , and was about to make a hasty retreat .
But the eye of love had already seen , even through the narrow <unk> of the wooden <unk> , the movement of the white <unk> , and observed the <unk> of the blue <unk> .
<unk> his lips close to the planks , he exclaimed : “ Don ’ t be alarmed , Valentine — it is I ! ” Again the timid girl found courage to return to the gate , saying , as she did so : “ And why do you come so late today ?
It is almost <unk> , and I had to use no little <unk> to get rid of my <unk> <unk> , my <unk> maid , and my troublesome brother , who is always <unk> me about coming to work at my <unk> , which I am in a fair way never to get done .
So pray excuse yourself as well as you can for having made me wait , and , after that , tell me why I see you in a dress so singular that at first I did not recognize you . ” “ <unk> Valentine , ” said the young man , “ the difference between our <unk> <unk> makes me fear to <unk> you by speaking of my love , but yet I cannot find myself in your presence without <unk> to <unk> forth my soul , and tell you how <unk> I adore you .
If it be but to carry away with me the recollection of such sweet moments , I could even thank you for <unk> me , for it leaves me a gleam of hope , that if you did not expect me ( and that indeed would be worse than vanity to suppose ) , at least I was in your thoughts .
You asked me the cause of my being late , and why I come <unk> .
I will <unk> explain the reason of both , and I trust to your goodness to pardon me .
I have chosen a trade . ” “ A trade ?
Oh , Maximilian , how can you jest at a time when we have such deep cause for uneasiness ? ” “ Heaven keep me from <unk> with that which is far <unk> to me than life itself !
But listen to me , Valentine , and I will tell you all about it .
I became weary of <unk> fields and <unk> walls , and seriously alarmed at the idea suggested by you , that if caught <unk> about here your father would very likely have me sent to prison as a thief .
That would <unk> the honor of the French army , to say nothing of the fact that the continual presence of a captain of <unk> in a place where no <unk> projects could be supposed to account for it might well create surprise ; so I have become a gardener , and , consequently , adopted the costume of my calling . ” “ What excessive nonsense you talk , Maximilian ! ” “ <unk> ?
Pray do not call what I consider the <unk> action of my life by such a name .
<unk> , by becoming a gardener I <unk> screen our <unk> from all suspicion or danger . ” <unk> “ I <unk> of you , Maximilian , to cease trifling , and tell me what you really mean . ” “ <unk> , that having <unk> that the piece of ground on which I stand was to let , I made application for it , was readily accepted by the <unk> , and am now master of this fine <unk> of <unk> .
Think of that , Valentine !
There is nothing now to prevent my building myself a little hut on my <unk> , and <unk> not twenty <unk> from you .
Only imagine what happiness that would afford me .
I can scarcely contain myself at the bare idea .
Such felicity seems above all price — as a thing impossible and <unk> .
But would you believe that I purchase all this delight , joy , and happiness , for which I would cheerfully have <unk> ten years of my life , at the small cost of <unk> francs per <unk> , paid <unk> ?
<unk> we have nothing to fear .
I am on my own ground , and have an <unk> right to place a ladder against the wall , and to look over when I please , without having any <unk> of being taken off by the police as a suspicious character .
I may also enjoy the precious privilege of <unk> you of my fond , faithful , and <unk> affection , whenever you visit your favorite <unk> , unless , indeed , it <unk> your pride to listen to <unk> of love from the lips of a poor <unk> , clad in a blouse and cap . ” A faint cry of mingled pleasure and surprise escaped from the lips of Valentine , who almost instantly said , in a <unk> tone , as though some <unk> cloud <unk> the joy which <unk> her heart : “ Alas , no , Maximilian , this must not be , for many reasons .
We should presume too much on our own strength , and , like others , perhaps , be led <unk> by our blind confidence in each other ’ s prudence . ” “ How can you for an instant entertain so unworthy a thought , dear Valentine ?
Have I not , from the first blessed hour of our acquaintance , <unk> all my words and actions to your sentiments and ideas ?
And you have , I am sure , the <unk> confidence in my honor .
When you spoke to me of <unk> a vague and <unk> sense of coming danger , I placed myself <unk> and <unk> at your service , asking no other <unk> than the pleasure of being useful to you ; and have I ever since , by word or look , given you cause of regret for having selected me from the numbers that would willingly have <unk> their lives for you ?
You told me , my dear Valentine , that you were engaged to M. d ’ Épinay , and that your father was resolved upon <unk> the match , and that from his will there was no appeal , as M. de Villefort was never known to change a determination once formed .
I kept in the background , as you wished , and waited , not for the decision of your heart or my own , but hoping that Providence would <unk> <unk> in our <unk> , and order events in our favor .
But what cared I for <unk> or difficulties , Valentine , as long as you confessed that you loved me , and took pity on me ?
If you will only repeat that <unk> now and then , I can endure anything . ” “ Ah , Maximilian , that is the very thing that makes you so bold , and which renders me at once so happy and unhappy , that I frequently ask myself whether it is better for me to endure the <unk> of my <unk> , and her blind preference for her own child , or to be , as I now am , <unk> to any pleasure save such as I find in these <unk> , so <unk> with danger to both . ” “ I will not admit that word , ” returned the young man ; “ it is at once cruel and unjust .
Is it possible to find a more <unk> slave than myself ?
You have permitted me to <unk> with you from time to time , Valentine , but forbidden my ever following you in your walks or elsewhere — have I not obeyed ?
And since I found means to enter this enclosure to exchange a few words with you through this gate — to be close to you without really seeing you — have I ever asked so much as to touch the <unk> of your gown or tried to pass this barrier which is but a trifle to one of my youth and strength ?
Never has a complaint or a murmur escaped me .
I have been bound by my promises as <unk> as any <unk> of <unk> times .
Come , come , dearest Valentine , confess that what I say is true , lest I be tempted to call you unjust . ” <unk> “ It is true , ” said Valentine , as she passed the end of her <unk> fingers through a small opening in the planks , and permitted Maximilian to press his lips to them , “ and you are a true and faithful friend ; but still you acted from motives of <unk> , my dear Maximilian , for you well knew that from the moment in which you had manifested an opposite spirit all would have been ended between us .
You promised to bestow on me the friendly affection of a brother .
For I have no friend but yourself upon earth , who am neglected and forgotten by my father , <unk> and <unk> by my <unk> , and left to the sole <unk> of a <unk> and <unk> old man , whose <unk> hand can no longer press mine , and who can speak to me with the eye alone , although there still <unk> in his heart the <unk> tenderness for his poor <unk> .
Oh , how bitter a fate is mine , to serve either as a victim or an enemy to all who are stronger than myself , while my only friend and <unk> is a living corpse !
Indeed , indeed , Maximilian , I am very miserable , and if you love me it must be out of pity . ” “ Valentine , ” replied the young man , deeply affected , “ I will not say you are all I love in the world , for I <unk> <unk> my sister and <unk> ; but my affection for them is calm and tranquil , in no manner resembling what I feel for you .
When I think of you my heart <unk> fast , the blood <unk> in my veins , and I can hardly breathe ; but I solemnly promise you to restrain all this <unk> , this <unk> and <unk> of feeling , until you yourself shall require me to render them available in <unk> or <unk> you .
M. Franz is not expected to return home for a year to come , I am told ; in that time many favorable and <unk> chances may <unk> us .
Let us , then , hope for the best ; hope is so sweet a <unk> .
Meanwhile , Valentine , while <unk> me with selfishness , think a little what you have been to me — the beautiful but cold resemblance of a marble <unk> .
What promise of future <unk> have you made me for all the <unk> and obedience I have <unk> ? — none whatever .
What granted me ? — scarcely more .
You tell me of M. Franz d ’ Épinay , your betrothed lover , and you <unk> from the idea of being his wife ; but tell me , Valentine , is there no other sorrow in your heart ?
You see me devoted to you , body and soul , my life and each warm drop that <unk> round my heart are <unk> to your service ; you know full well that my existence is bound up in yours — that were I to lose you I would not <unk> the hour of such crushing misery ; yet you speak with calmness of the prospect of your being the wife of another !
Oh , Valentine , were I in your place , and did I feel conscious , as you do , of being <unk> , adored , with such a love as mine , a hundred times at least should I have passed my hand between these iron bars , and said , ‘ Take this hand , dearest Maximilian , and believe that , living or dead , I am yours — yours only , and forever ! ’ ” The poor girl made no reply , but her lover could plainly hear her sobs and tears .
A rapid change took place in the young man ’ s feelings .
“ <unk> , dearest Valentine , ” exclaimed he , “ forgive me if I have offended you , and forget the words I spoke if they have <unk> caused you pain . ” “ No , Maximilian , I am not offended , ” answered she , “ but do you not see what a poor , helpless being I am , almost a stranger and an <unk> in my father ’ s house , where even he is seldom seen ; whose will has been <unk> , and spirits broken , from the age of ten years , beneath the iron <unk> so <unk> held over me ; <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , day by day , hour by hour , minute by minute , no person has cared for , even observed my sufferings , nor have I ever breathed one word on the subject save to yourself .
<unk> and in the eyes of the world , I am surrounded by kindness and affection ; but the <unk> is the case .
The general remark is , ‘ Oh , it cannot be expected that one of so stern a character as M. Villefort could <unk> the tenderness some fathers do on their daughters .
What though she has lost her own mother at a tender age , she has had the happiness to find a second mother in Madame de Villefort . ’ The world , however , is mistaken ; my father <unk> me from utter indifference , while my <unk> <unk> me with a hatred so much the more terrible because it is veiled beneath a continual smile . ” “ <unk> you , sweet Valentine , ” exclaimed the young man ; “ how is it possible for anyone to do that ? ” “ Alas , ” replied the weeping girl , “ I am obliged to own that my <unk> ’ s <unk> to me <unk> from a very natural source — her <unk> love for her own child , my brother Edward . ” “ But why should it ? ” “ I do not know ; but , though unwilling to introduce money matters into our present conversation , I will just say this much — that her extreme dislike to me has its origin there ; and I much fear she <unk> me the fortune I enjoy in right of my mother , and which will be more than <unk> at the death of M. and <unk>
de Saint-Méran , whose sole <unk> I am .
Madame de Villefort has nothing of her own , and <unk> me for being so <unk> <unk> .
Alas , how <unk> would I exchange the half of this wealth for the happiness of at least <unk> my father ’ s love .
God knows , I would prefer <unk> the whole , so that it would obtain me a happy and affectionate home . ” “ Poor Valentine ! ” “ I seem to myself as though living a life of <unk> , yet at the same time am so conscious of my own weakness that I fear to break the <unk> in which I am held , lest I fall utterly helpless .
Then , too , my father is not a person whose orders may be <unk> with <unk> ; protected as he is by his high position and firmly established reputation for talent and <unk> <unk> , no one could oppose him ; he is <unk> even with the king ; he would crush you at a word .
Dear Maximilian , believe me when I assure you that if I do not attempt to resist my father ’ s <unk> it is more on your account than my own . ” “ But why , Valentine , do you <unk> in <unk> the worst , — why picture so gloomy a future ? ” “ Because I judge it from the past . ” “ Still , consider that although I may not be , <unk> speaking , what is <unk> an illustrious match for you , I am , for many reasons , not altogether so much beneath your alliance .
The days when such <unk> were so <unk> weighed and considered no longer exist in France , and the first families of the monarchy have <unk> with those of the <unk> .
The <unk> of the <unk> has <unk> itself with the nobility of the cannon .
Now I belong to this <unk> class ; and certainly my prospects of military <unk> are most <unk> as well as certain .
My fortune , though small , is free and <unk> , and the memory of my late father is respected in our country , Valentine , as that of the most upright and honorable merchant of the city ; I say our country , because you were born not far from Marseilles . ” “ Don ’ t speak of Marseilles , I beg of you , Maximilian ; that one word brings back my mother to my recollection — my angel mother , who died too soon for myself and all who knew her ; but who , after watching over her child during the brief period <unk> to her in this world , now , I <unk> hope , <unk> from her home in heaven .
Oh , if my mother were still living , there would be nothing to fear , Maximilian , for I would tell her that I loved you , and she would protect us . ” “ I fear , Valentine , ” replied the lover , “ that were she living I should never have had the happiness of knowing you ; you would then have been too happy to have <unk> from your grandeur to bestow a thought on me . ” “ Now it is you who are unjust , Maximilian , ” cried Valentine ; “ but there is one thing I wish to know . ” “ And what is that ? ” inquired the young man , perceiving that Valentine hesitated .
“ Tell me truly , Maximilian , whether in former days , when our fathers dwelt at Marseilles , there was ever any <unk> between them ? ” “ Not that I am aware of , ” replied the young man , “ unless , indeed , any <unk> might have <unk> from their being of opposite parties — your father was , as you know , a <unk> <unk> of the <unk> , while mine was wholly devoted to the emperor ; there could not possibly be any other difference between them .
But why do you ask ? ” “ I will tell you , ” replied the young girl , “ for it is but right you should know .
Well , on the day when your <unk> as an officer of the Legion of Honor was announced in the papers , we were all sitting with my grandfather , M. Noirtier ; M. Danglars was there also — you recollect M. Danglars , do you not , Maximilian , the banker , whose horses ran away with my <unk> and little brother , and very nearly killed them ?
While the rest of the company were <unk> the approaching marriage of Mademoiselle Danglars , I was reading the paper to my grandfather ; but when I came to the paragraph about you , although I had done nothing else but read it over to myself all the morning ( you know you had told me all about it the previous evening ) , I felt so happy , and yet so nervous , at the idea of speaking your name aloud , and before so many people , that I really think I should have passed it over , but for the fear that my doing so might create suspicions as to the cause of my silence ; so I summoned up all my courage , and read it as firmly and as <unk> as I could . ” <unk> “ Dear Valentine ! ” “ Well , would you believe it ?
directly my father caught the sound of your name he turned round quite hastily , and , like a poor silly thing , I was so persuaded that everyone must be as much affected as myself by the utterance of your name , that I was not surprised to see my father start , and almost tremble ; but I even thought ( though that surely must have been a mistake ) that M. Danglars trembled too . ” “ ‘ Morrel , Morrel , ’ cried my father , ‘ stop a bit ; ’ then <unk> his <unk> into a deep <unk> , he added , ‘ surely this cannot be one of the Morrel family who lived at Marseilles , and gave us so much trouble from their violent <unk> — I mean about the year 1815 . ’ “ ‘ Yes , ’ replied M. Danglars , ‘ I believe he is the son of the old <unk> . ’ ” “ Indeed , ” answered Maximilian ; “ and what did your father say then , Valentine ? ” “ Oh , such a dreadful thing , that I don ’ t dare to tell you . ” “ <unk> tell me everything , ” said Maximilian with a smile .
“ ‘ Ah , ’ continued my father , still <unk> , ‘ their <unk> emperor treated these <unk> as they deserved ; he called them ‘ food for cannon , ’ which was precisely all they were good for ; and I am delighted to see that the present government have adopted this <unk> principle with all its <unk> <unk> ; if <unk> were good for nothing but to furnish the means of carrying so admirable an idea into practice , it would be an <unk> well worthy of <unk> to obtain .
Though it certainly does cost France somewhat dear to <unk> her rights in that <unk> country . ’ ” “ <unk> politics , I must confess . ” said Maximilian ; “ but don ’ t attach any serious importance , dear , to what your father said .
My father was not a bit behind yours in that sort of talk .
‘ Why , ’ said he , ‘ does not the emperor , who has <unk> so many clever and <unk> <unk> of <unk> the art of war , <unk> a regiment of <unk> , judges and legal <unk> , sending them in the <unk> fire the enemy could <unk> , and using them to save better men ? ’ You see , my dear , that for picturesque expression and <unk> of spirit there is not much to choose between the language of either party .
But what did M. Danglars say to this <unk> on the part of the procureur ? ” “ Oh , he laughed , and in that singular manner so peculiar to himself — <unk> , <unk> ; he almost immediately got up and took his leave ; then , for the first time , I observed the agitation of my grandfather , and I must tell you , Maximilian , that I am the only person capable of <unk> emotion in his <unk> frame .
And I suspected that the conversation that had been carried on in his presence ( for they always say and do what they like before the dear old man , without the smallest regard for his feelings ) had made a strong impression on his mind ; for , naturally enough , it must have <unk> him to hear the emperor he so <unk> loved and served spoken of in that <unk> manner . ” “ The name of M. Noirtier , ” <unk> Maximilian , “ is celebrated throughout Europe ; he was a <unk> of high standing , and you may or may not know , Valentine , that he took a leading part in every Bonapartist <unk> set on foot during the <unk> of the <unk> . ” “ Oh , I have often heard <unk> of things that seem to me most strange — the father a Bonapartist , the son a <unk> ; what can have been the reason of so singular a difference in parties and politics ?
But to <unk> my story ; I turned towards my grandfather , as though to question him as to the cause of his emotion ; he looked <unk> at the <unk> I had been reading .
‘ What is the matter , dear grandfather ? ’ said I , ‘ are you pleased ? ’ He gave me a sign in the <unk> .
‘ With what my father said just now ? ’ He returned a sign in the <unk> .
‘ Perhaps you liked what M. Danglars said ? ’ Another sign in the <unk> .
‘ Oh , then , you were glad to hear that M. Morrel ( I didn ’ t dare to say Maximilian ) had been made an officer of the Legion of Honor ? ’ He signified <unk> ; only think of the poor old man ’ s being so pleased to think that you , who were a perfect stranger to him , had been made an officer of the Legion of Honor !
Perhaps it was a mere <unk> on his part , for he is falling , they say , into second childhood , but I love him for showing so much interest in you . ” “ How singular , ” murmured Maximilian ; “ your father <unk> me , while your grandfather , on the contrary — What strange feelings are aroused by politics . ” “ Hush , ” cried Valentine , suddenly ; “ someone is coming ! ” Maximilian leaped at one bound into his <unk> of <unk> , which he began to <unk> up in the most <unk> way , under the pretext of being occupied in <unk> it .
“ Mademoiselle , mademoiselle ! ” exclaimed a voice from behind the trees .
“ Madame is searching for you everywhere ; there is a visitor in the drawing-room . ” “ A visitor ? ” inquired Valentine , much agitated ; “ who is it ? ” “ Some grand personage — a prince I believe they said — the Count of Monte Cristo . ” “ I will come directly , ” cried Valentine aloud .
The name of Monte Cristo sent an <unk> shock through the young man on the other side of the iron gate , to whom Valentine ’ s _ “ I am coming ” _ was the <unk> signal of farewell .
“ Now , then , ” said Maximilian , leaning on the handle of his <unk> , “ I would give a good deal to know how it comes about that the Count of Monte Cristo is acquainted with M. de Villefort . ” Chapter <unk> .
<unk> It was really the Count of Monte Cristo who had just arrived at Madame de Villefort ’ s for the purpose of returning the procureur ’ s visit , and at his name , as may be easily imagined , the whole house was in confusion .
Madame de Villefort , who was alone in her drawing-room when the count was announced , desired that her son might be brought thither instantly to <unk> his thanks to the count ; and Edward , who heard this great personage talked of for two whole days , made all possible haste to come to him , not from obedience to his mother , or out of any feeling of gratitude to the count , but from <unk> curiosity , and that some chance remark might give him the opportunity for making one of the <unk> <unk> which made his mother say : “ Oh , that <unk> child !
But I can ’ t be severe with him , he is really _ so _ bright . ” After the usual <unk> , the count inquired after M. de Villefort .
“ My husband <unk> with the <unk> , ” replied the young lady ; “ he has just gone , and I am sure he ’ ll be exceedingly sorry not to have had the pleasure of seeing you before he went . ” Two visitors who were there when the count arrived , having gazed at him with all their eyes , retired after that reasonable delay which politeness <unk> and curiosity requires .
“ What is your sister Valentine doing ? ” inquired Madame de Villefort of Edward ; “ tell someone to <unk> her come here , that I may have the honor of <unk> her to the count . ” “ You have a daughter , then , madame ? ” inquired the count ; “ very young , I presume ? ” “ The daughter of M. de Villefort by his first marriage , ” replied the young wife , “ a fine <unk> girl . ” “ But melancholy , ” interrupted Master Edward , <unk> the <unk> out of the <unk> of a splendid <unk> that was <unk> on its gilded <unk> , in order to make a <unk> for his hat .
Madame de Villefort merely cried , “ Be still , Edward ! ” She then added , “ This young <unk> is , however , very nearly right , and merely <unk> what he has heard me say with pain a hundred times ; for Mademoiselle de Villefort is , in spite of all we can do to <unk> her , of a melancholy disposition and <unk> habit , which frequently <unk> the effect of her beauty .
But what <unk> her ?
Go , Edward , and see . ” “ Because they are looking for her where she is not to be found . ” “ And where are they looking for her ? ” “ With grandpapa Noirtier . ” “ And do you think she is not there ? ” “ No , no , no , no , no , she is not there , ” replied Edward , singing his words .
“ And where is she , then ?
If you know , why don ’ t you tell ? ” “ She is under the big <unk> , ” replied the <unk> <unk> , as he gave , in spite of his mother ’ s <unk> , live flies to the <unk> , which seemed <unk> to <unk> such <unk> .
Madame de Villefort stretched out her hand to ring , intending to direct her <unk> to the spot where she would find Valentine , when the young lady herself entered the apartment .
She appeared much <unk> ; and any person who considered her attentively might have observed the traces of recent tears in her eyes .
Valentine , whom we have in the rapid march of our <unk> presented to our <unk> without <unk> <unk> her , was a tall and graceful girl of nineteen , with bright <unk> hair , deep blue eyes , and that <unk> air of quiet distinction which <unk> her mother .
Her white and <unk> fingers , her <unk> neck , her cheeks <unk> with <unk> <unk> reminded one of the lovely <unk> who have been so <unk> compared in their manner to the <unk> of a <unk> .
She entered the apartment , and seeing near her <unk> the stranger of whom she had already heard so much , <unk> him without any <unk> <unk> , or even <unk> her eyes , and with an elegance that redoubled the count ’ s attention .
He rose to return the <unk> .
“ Mademoiselle de Villefort , my <unk> , ” said Madame de Villefort to Monte Cristo , leaning back on her sofa and <unk> towards Valentine with her hand .
“ And M. de Monte Cristo , King of <unk> , Emperor of <unk> , ” said the young <unk> , looking <unk> towards his sister .
Madame de Villefort at this really did turn pale , and was very nearly angry with this household <unk> , who answered to the name of Edward ; but the count , on the contrary , smiled , and appeared to look at the boy <unk> , which caused the <unk> heart to bound again with joy and enthusiasm .
“ But , madame , ” replied the count , <unk> the conversation , and looking by turns at Madame de Villefort and Valentine , “ have I not already had the honor of meeting yourself and mademoiselle before ?
I could not help thinking so just now ; the idea came over my mind , and as mademoiselle entered the sight of her was an additional ray of light thrown on a confused remembrance ; excuse the remark . ” “ I do not think it likely , sir ; Mademoiselle de Villefort is not very fond of society , and we very seldom go out , ” said the young lady .
“ Then it was not in society that I met with mademoiselle or yourself , madame , or this charming little merry boy .
Besides , the Parisian world is entirely unknown to me , for , as I believe I told you , I have been in Paris but very few days .
No , — but , perhaps , you will permit me to call to mind — stay ! ” The Count placed his hand on his brow as if to collect his thoughts .
“ No — it was somewhere — away from here — it was — I do not know — but it appears that this recollection is connected with a lovely sky and some religious _ <unk> _ ; mademoiselle was holding flowers in her hand , the interesting boy was <unk> a beautiful <unk> in a garden , and you , madame , were under the <unk> of some <unk> .
Pray come to my aid , madame ; do not these circumstances appeal to your memory ? ” “ No , indeed , ” replied Madame de Villefort ; “ and yet it appears to me , sir , that if I had met you anywhere , the recollection of you must have been <unk> on my memory . ” “ Perhaps the count saw us in Italy , ” said Valentine <unk> .
“ Yes , in Italy ; it was in Italy most probably , ” replied Monte Cristo ; “ you have travelled then in Italy , mademoiselle ? ” “ Yes ; madame and I were there two years ago .
The <unk> , anxious for my <unk> , had <unk> the air of Naples .
We went by <unk> , <unk> , and Rome . ” “ Ah , yes — true , mademoiselle , ” exclaimed Monte Cristo as if this simple explanation was sufficient to <unk> the recollection he sought .
“ It was at <unk> on <unk> <unk> <unk> , in the garden of the Hôtel des <unk> , when chance brought us together ; you , Madame de Villefort , and her son ; I now remember having had the honor of meeting you . ” “ I perfectly well remember <unk> , sir , and the Hôtel des <unk> , and the festival of which you speak , ” said Madame de Villefort , “ but in vain do I tax my memory , of whose <unk> I am ashamed , for I really do not recall to mind that I ever had the pleasure of seeing you before . ” “ It is strange , but neither do I recollect meeting with you , ” observed Valentine , raising her beautiful eyes to the count .
<unk> “ But I remember it perfectly , ” <unk> the darling Edward .
“ I will assist your memory , madame , ” continued the count ; “ the day had been burning hot ; you were waiting for horses , which were delayed in consequence of the festival .
Mademoiselle was walking in the shade of the garden , and your son disappeared in pursuit of the <unk> . ” “ And I caught it , <unk> , don ’ t you remember ? ” <unk> Edward , “ and I pulled three such beautiful <unk> out of his <unk> . ” “ You , madame , remained under the <unk> ; do you not remember , that while you were seated on a stone bench , and while , as I told you , Mademoiselle de Villefort and your young son were absent , you <unk> for a considerable time with somebody ? ” “ Yes , in truth , yes , ” answered the young lady , turning very red , “ I do remember conversing with a person wrapped in a long woollen mantle ; he was a <unk> man , I think . ” “ <unk> so , madame ; this man was myself ; for a fortnight I had been at that hotel , during which period I had <unk> my valet de chambre of a fever , and my landlord of the <unk> , so that I really acquired a reputation as a skilful physician .
We <unk> a long time , madame , on different subjects ; of <unk> , of <unk> , of manners , customs , of the famous _ <unk> <unk> _ , of which they had told you , I think you said , that certain <unk> in <unk> had preserved the secret . ” “ Yes , true , ” replied Madame de Villefort , somewhat <unk> , “ I remember now . ” “ I do not recollect now all the various subjects of which we <unk> , madame , ” continued the count with perfect calmness ; “ but I perfectly remember that , falling into the error which others had entertained respecting me , you consulted me as to the health of Mademoiselle de Villefort . ” “ Yes , really , sir , you were in fact a <unk> man , ” said Madame de Villefort , “ since you had <unk> the sick . ” “ <unk> or <unk> would reply to you , madame , that it was precisely because I was not , that I had <unk> my <unk> ; for myself , I am content to say to you that I have studied <unk> and the natural <unk> somewhat deeply , but still only as an <unk> , you understand . ” At this moment the clock struck six .
“ It is six o ’ clock , ” said Madame de Villefort , evidently agitated .
“ Valentine , will you not go and see if your grandpapa will have his dinner ? ” Valentine rose , and <unk> the count , left the apartment without speaking .
“ Oh , madame , ” said the count , when Valentine had left the room , “ was it on my account that you sent Mademoiselle de Villefort away ? ” “ By no means , ” replied the young lady quickly ; “ but this is the hour when we usually give M. Noirtier the <unk> <unk> that <unk> his <unk> existence .
You are aware , sir , of the <unk> condition of my husband ’ s father ? ” “ Yes , madame , M. de Villefort spoke of it to me — a <unk> , I think . ” “ Alas , yes ; the poor old gentleman is entirely helpless ; the mind alone is still active in this human <unk> , and that is faint and <unk> , like the light of a lamp about to <unk> .
But excuse me , sir , for talking of our domestic misfortunes ; I interrupted you at the moment when you were telling me that you were a skilful <unk> . ” “ No , madame , I did not say as much as that , ” replied the count with a smile ; “ quite the contrary .
I have studied <unk> because , having determined to live in <unk> <unk> I have been desirous of following the example of King <unk> . ” “ _ <unk> , <unk> <unk> _ , ” said the young <unk> , as he tore some beautiful <unk> out of a splendid <unk> , “ the individual who took <unk> in his cup of poison every morning at breakfast . ” “ Edward , you <unk> boy , ” exclaimed Madame de Villefort , <unk> the <unk> book from the <unk> ’ s grasp , “ you are positively past bearing ; you really disturb the conversation ; go , leave us , and join your sister Valentine in dear grandpapa Noirtier ’ s room . ” “ The <unk> , ” said Edward <unk> .
“ What do you mean ? — the <unk> ! ” “ I want the <unk> . ” “ How dare you tear out the <unk> ? ” “ Oh , it <unk> me . ” “ Go — go at once . ” “ I won ’ t go unless you give me the <unk> , ” said the boy , <unk> himself <unk> in an armchair , according to his habit of never giving way .
“ Take it , then , and pray disturb us no longer , ” said Madame de Villefort , giving the <unk> to Edward , who then went towards the door , led by his mother .
The count followed her with his eyes .
“ Let us see if she <unk> the door after him , ” he muttered .
Madame de Villefort closed the door carefully after the child , the count appearing not to notice her ; then casting a <unk> glance around the chamber , the young wife returned to her chair , in which she seated herself .
“ <unk> me to observe , madame , ” said the count , with that kind tone he could assume so well , “ you are really very severe with that dear clever child . ” “ Oh , sometimes severity is quite necessary , ” replied Madame de Villefort , with all a mother ’ s real <unk> .
“ It was his <unk> <unk> that Master Edward was <unk> when he <unk> to King <unk> , ” continued the count , “ and you interrupted him in a <unk> which <unk> that his <unk> has by no means neglected him , for your son is really advanced for his years . ” “ The fact is , count , ” answered the mother , <unk> flattered , “ he has great <unk> , and <unk> all that is set before him .
He has but one fault , he is somewhat <unk> ; but really , on <unk> for the moment to what he said , do you truly believe that <unk> used these precautions , and that these precautions were <unk> ? ” “ I think so , madame , because I myself have made use of them , that I might not be <unk> at Naples , at <unk> , and at <unk> — that is to say , on three several occasions when , but for these precautions , I must have lost my life . ” “ And your precautions were successful ? ” “ <unk> so . ” “ Yes , I remember now your <unk> to me at <unk> something of this sort . ” “ Indeed ? ” said the count with an air of surprise , remarkably well <unk> ; “ I really did not remember . ” “ I inquired of you if <unk> acted equally , and with the same effect , on men of the North as on men of the South ; and you answered me that the cold and <unk> habits of the North did not present the same <unk> as the rich and energetic <unk> of the <unk> of the South . ” “ And that is the case , ” observed Monte Cristo .
“ I have seen <unk> <unk> , without being <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> which would <unk> have killed a <unk> or an <unk> . ” “ And you really believe the result would be still more sure with us than in the East , and in the midst of our <unk> and <unk> a man would <unk> himself more easily than in a warm <unk> to this <unk> <unk> of poison ? ” “ Certainly ; it being at the same time perfectly understood that he should have been <unk> <unk> against the poison to which he had not been accustomed . ” “ Yes , I understand that ; and how would you <unk> yourself , for instance , or rather , how did you <unk> yourself to it ? ” “ Oh , very easily .
<unk> you knew beforehand the poison that would be made use of against you ; suppose the poison was , for instance , <unk> — — ” “ <unk> is <unk> from the false <unk> is it not ? ” inquired Madame de Villefort .
“ <unk> , madame , ” replied Monte Cristo ; “ but I perceive I have not much to teach you .
<unk> me to compliment you on your knowledge ; such <unk> is very rare among ladies . ” “ Oh , I am aware of that , ” said Madame de Villefort ; “ but I have a passion for the <unk> <unk> , which speak to the imagination like <unk> , and are <unk> to figures , like an <unk> <unk> ; but go on , I beg of you ; what you say interests me to the greatest degree . ” <unk> “ Well , ” replied Monte Cristo “ suppose , then , that this poison was <unk> , and you were to take a <unk> the first day , two <unk> the second day , and so on .
Well , at the end of ten days you would have taken a <unk> , at the end of twenty days , increasing another <unk> , you would have taken three hundred <unk> ; that is to say , a <unk> which you would support without inconvenience , and which would be very dangerous for any other person who had not taken the same precautions as yourself .
Well , then , at the end of a month , when drinking water from the same <unk> , you would kill the person who drank with you , without your perceiving , otherwise than from slight inconvenience , that there was any <unk> substance mingled with this water . ” “ Do you know any other <unk> ? ” “ I do not . ” “ I have often read , and read again , the history of <unk> , ” said Madame de Villefort in a tone of reflection , “ and had always considered it a <unk> . ” “ No , madame , contrary to most history , it is true ; but what you tell me , madame , what you inquire of me , is not the result of a chance <unk> , for two years ago you asked me the same questions , and said then , that for a very long time this history of <unk> had occupied your mind . ” “ True , sir .
The two favorite studies of my youth were <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> , when I learned that the use of <unk> frequently explained the whole history of a people , and the entire life of <unk> in the East , as flowers <unk> and <unk> a love affair , I have regretted that I was not a man , that I might have been a <unk> , a <unk> , or a <unk> . ” “ And the more , madame , ” said Monte Cristo , “ as the <unk> do not confine themselves , as did <unk> , to make a <unk> of his <unk> , but they also made them a <unk> .
<unk> becomes , in their hands , not only a <unk> weapon , but still more frequently an <unk> one ; the one <unk> against all their physical sufferings , the other against all their enemies .
With <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and the <unk> , they put to sleep all who stand in their way .
There is not one of those women , <unk> , <unk> , or Greek , whom here you call ‘ good women , ’ who do not know how , by means of <unk> , to <unk> a doctor , and in <unk> to <unk> a <unk> . ” “ Really , ” said Madame de Villefort , whose eyes <unk> with strange fire at this conversation .
“ Oh , yes , indeed , madame , ” continued Monte Cristo , “ the secret <unk> of the East begin with a love <unk> and end with a death <unk> — begin with paradise and end with — hell .
There are as many <unk> of every kind as there are <unk> and <unk> in the physical and moral nature of humanity ; and I will say further — the art of these <unk> is capable with the utmost <unk> to <unk> and proportion the remedy and the <unk> to <unk> for love or desires for vengeance . ” “ But , sir , ” remarked the young woman , “ these <unk> <unk> , in the midst of which you have passed a portion of your existence , are as fantastic as the <unk> that come from their strange land .
A man can easily be put out of the way there , then ; it is , indeed , the <unk> and <unk> of the _ <unk> and One <unk> _ .
The <unk> and <unk> who rule over society there , and who <unk> what in France we call the government , are really <unk> and <unk> , who not only pardon a <unk> , but even make him a <unk> minister , if his crime has been an ingenious one , and who , under such circumstances , have the whole story written in letters of gold , to <unk> their hours of <unk> and _ <unk> _ . ” “ By no means , madame ; the <unk> exists no longer in the East .
There , <unk> under other names , and concealed under other <unk> , are police agents , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
They hang , <unk> , and <unk> their <unk> in the most agreeable possible manner ; but some of these , like clever <unk> , have contrived to escape human justice , and succeed in their <unk> <unk> by cunning <unk> .
<unk> us a <unk> , possessed by the <unk> of hate or <unk> , who has an enemy to destroy , or some near relation to <unk> of , goes straight to the <unk> ’ s or <unk> ’ s , gives a false name , which leads more easily to his <unk> than his real one , and under the pretext that the <unk> prevent him from sleeping , <unk> five or six <unk> of <unk> — if he is really a cunning fellow , he goes to five or six different <unk> or <unk> , and <unk> becomes only five or six times more easily traced ; — then , when he has acquired his <unk> , he <unk> <unk> to his enemy , or near <unk> , a <unk> of <unk> which would make a <unk> or <unk> burst , and which , without <unk> or reason , makes his victim utter <unk> which alarm the entire neighborhood .
Then arrive a crowd of <unk> and <unk> .
They fetch a doctor , who opens the dead body , and <unk> from the <unk> and stomach a quantity of <unk> in a <unk> .
<unk> day a hundred newspapers relate the fact , with the names of the victim and the murderer .
The same evening the <unk> or <unk> , <unk> or <unk> , come and say , ‘ It was I who sold the <unk> to the gentleman ; ’ and rather than not recognize the guilty <unk> , they will recognize twenty .
Then the foolish criminal is taken , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , condemned , and cut off by <unk> or steel ; or if she be a woman of any consideration , they lock her up for life .
This is the way in which you <unk> understand <unk> , madame .
<unk> was , however , I must confess , more skilful . ” “ What would you have , sir ? ” said the lady , laughing ; “ we do what we can .
All the world has not the secret of the <unk> or the <unk> . ” “ Now , ” replied the count , <unk> his shoulders , “ shall I tell you the cause of all these <unk> ?
It is because , at your <unk> , by what at least I could judge by reading the pieces they play , they see persons <unk> the contents of a <unk> , or <unk> the <unk> of a ring , and fall dead instantly .
Five minutes afterwards the curtain falls , and the spectators depart .
They are ignorant of the <unk> of the murder ; they see neither the police <unk> with his <unk> of office , nor the <unk> with his four men ; and so the poor <unk> believe that the whole thing is as easy as lying .
But go a little way from France — go either to <unk> or <unk> , or only to Naples or Rome , and you will see people passing by you in the streets — people erect , smiling , and <unk> , of whom <unk> , if you were holding on by the <unk> of his mantle , would say , ‘ That man was <unk> three weeks ago ; he will be a dead man in a month . ’ ” “ Then , ” remarked Madame de Villefort , “ they have again discovered the secret of the famous _ <unk> <unk> _ that they said was lost at <unk> . ” “ Ah , but madame , does mankind ever lose anything ?
The <unk> change about and make a tour of the world ; things take a different name , and the vulgar do not follow them — that is all ; but there is always the same result .
<unk> act particularly on some <unk> or another — one on the stomach , another on the brain , another on the <unk> .
Well , the poison brings on a <unk> , the <unk> an <unk> of the <unk> , or some other complaint <unk> in the book of science , which , however , by no means <unk> it from being decidedly mortal ; and if it were not , would be sure to become so , thanks to the <unk> applied by foolish <unk> , who are generally bad <unk> , and which will act in favor of or against the malady , as you please ; and then there is a human being killed according to all the <unk> of art and skill , and of whom justice <unk> nothing , as was said by a terrible <unk> of my acquaintance , the worthy Abbé <unk> of <unk> , in <unk> , who has studied these <unk> <unk> very profoundly . ” “ It is quite frightful , but deeply interesting , ” said the young lady , motionless with attention .
“ I thought , I must confess , that these <unk> , were <unk> of the <unk> <unk> . ” “ Yes , no doubt , but <unk> upon by ours .
What is the use of time , <unk> of merit , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , if they do not lead society towards more complete perfection ?
Yet man will never be perfect until he <unk> to create and destroy ; he does know how to destroy , and that is half the battle . ” “ So , ” added Madame de Villefort , constantly returning to her object , “ the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , and later , probably , that of Baron de <unk> , whose story has been so <unk> by modern drama and romance — — ” “ Were objects of art , madame , and nothing more , ” replied the count .
“ Do you suppose that the real _ <unk> _ <unk> himself <unk> to the mere individual ?
By no means .
<unk> loves <unk> , <unk> and bounds , <unk> of strength , fancies , if I may be allowed so to <unk> them .
Thus , for instance , the excellent Abbé <unk> , of whom I spoke just now , made in this way some marvellous <unk> . ” “ Really ? ” “ Yes ; I will mention one to you .
He had a remarkably fine garden , full of <unk> , flowers , and fruit .
From amongst these <unk> he selected the most simple — a <unk> , for instance .
For three days he <unk> this <unk> with a <unk> of <unk> ; on the third , the <unk> began to <unk> and turn yellow .
At that moment he cut it .
In the eyes of everybody it seemed fit for table , and preserved its <unk> appearance .
It was only <unk> to the Abbé <unk> .
He then took the <unk> to the room where he had <unk> — for the Abbé <unk> had a collection of <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , fully as fine as his collection of <unk> , flowers , and fruit .
Well , the Abbé <unk> took a <unk> , and made it eat a <unk> of the <unk> .
The <unk> died .
What magistrate would find , or even venture to <unk> , anything against this ?
What procureur has ever ventured to draw up an accusation against M. <unk> or M. <unk> , in consequence of the <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> they have killed ? — not one .
So , then , the <unk> <unk> , and justice takes no notice .
This <unk> dead , the Abbé <unk> has its <unk> taken out by his <unk> and thrown on the <unk> ; on this <unk> is a <unk> , who , <unk> these <unk> , is in her turn taken ill , and <unk> next day .
At the moment when she is <unk> in the <unk> of death , a <unk> is flying by ( there are a good many <unk> in <unk> ’ s country ) ; this bird <unk> on the dead fowl , and <unk> it away to a rock , where it <unk> off its prey .
Three days afterwards , this poor <unk> , which has been very much <unk> since that dinner , suddenly feels very <unk> while flying <unk> in the clouds , and falls heavily into a <unk> .
The <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> eat <unk> always , as everybody knows — well , they feast on the <unk> .
Now suppose that next day , one of these <unk> , or <unk> , or <unk> , <unk> at the fourth remove , is served up at your table .
Well , then , your guest will be <unk> at the fifth remove , and die , at the end of eight or ten days , of pains in the <unk> , <unk> , or <unk> of the <unk> .
The <unk> open the body and say with an air of profound <unk> , ‘ The subject has died of a <unk> on the <unk> , or of <unk> fever ! ’ ” “ But , ” remarked Madame de Villefort , “ all these circumstances which you <unk> thus to one another may be broken by the least accident ; the <unk> may not see the fowl , or may fall a hundred <unk> from the <unk> . ” “ Ah , that is where the art comes in .
To be a great <unk> in the East , one must direct chance ; and this is to be <unk> . ” Madame de Villefort was in deep thought , yet listened attentively .
“ But , ” she exclaimed , suddenly , “ <unk> is <unk> , <unk> ; in <unk> way it is absorbed , it will be found again in the body of the victim from the moment when it has been taken in sufficient quantity to cause death . ” “ <unk> so , ” cried Monte Cristo — “ precisely so ; and this is what I said to my worthy <unk> .
He reflected , smiled , and replied to me by a <unk> <unk> , which I believe is also a French <unk> , ‘ My son , the world was not made in a day — but in seven .
<unk> on Sunday . ’ On the Sunday following I did return to him .
<unk> of having <unk> his <unk> with <unk> , he had <unk> it this time with a <unk> of <unk> , having their <unk> in <unk> , _ <unk> <unk> _ , as the learned <unk> it .
Now , the <unk> had not the slightest appearance of <unk> in the world , and the <unk> had not the smallest distrust ; yet , five minutes afterwards , the <unk> was dead .
The fowl <unk> at the <unk> , and the next day was a dead <unk> .
This time we were the <unk> ; so we opened the bird , and this time all special symptoms had disappeared , there were only general symptoms .
There was no peculiar <unk> in any <unk> — an excitement of the nervous system — that was it ; a case of <unk> <unk> — nothing more .
The fowl had not been <unk> — she had died of <unk> .
<unk> is a rare <unk> among <unk> , I believe , but very common among men . ” Madame de Villefort appeared more and more thoughtful .
“ It is very fortunate , ” she observed , “ that such <unk> could only be prepared by <unk> ; otherwise , all the world would be <unk> each other . ” “ By <unk> and persons who have a taste for <unk> , ” said Monte Cristo <unk> .
“ And then , ” said Madame de Villefort , endeavoring by a struggle , and with effort , to get away from her thoughts , “ however <unk> it is prepared , crime is always crime , and if it avoid human <unk> , it does not escape the eye of God .
The <unk> are stronger than we are in cases of conscience , and , very <unk> , have no hell — that is the point . ” <unk> “ Really , madame , this is a scruple which naturally must occur to a pure mind like yours , but which would easily yield before sound reasoning .
The bad side of human thought will always be <unk> by the <unk> of Jean <unk> <unk> , — you remember , — the <unk> who is killed five hundred leagues off by raising the <unk> of the finger .
Man ’ s whole life passes in doing these things , and his <unk> is exhausted by <unk> on them .
You will find very few persons who will go and <unk> thrust a knife in the heart of a <unk> , or will <unk> to him , in order to remove him from the surface of the <unk> on which we move with life and animation , that quantity of <unk> of which we just now talked .
Such a thing is really out of rule — eccentric or stupid .
To <unk> such a point , the blood must be <unk> to <unk> degrees , the pulse be , at least , at <unk> , and the feelings excited beyond the ordinary <unk> .
But suppose one pass , as is <unk> in <unk> , from the word itself to its softened <unk> , then , instead of <unk> an <unk> <unk> you make an ‘ <unk> ; ’ you merely and simply remove from your path the individual who is in your way , and that without shock or violence , without the display of the sufferings which , in the case of becoming a punishment , make a <unk> of the victim , and a <unk> , in every sense of the word , of him who <unk> them .
Then there will be no blood , no <unk> , no <unk> , and above all , no consciousness of that horrid and <unk> moment of <unk> the act , — then one <unk> the <unk> of the human law , which says , ‘ Do not disturb society ! ’ This is the mode in which they manage these things , and succeed in <unk> <unk> , where there are grave and <unk> persons who care very little for the questions of time in <unk> of importance . ” “ Yet conscience remains , ” remarked Madame de Villefort in an agitated voice , and with a stifled sigh .
“ Yes , ” answered Monte Cristo “ happily , yes , conscience does remain ; and if it did not , how wretched we should be !
After every action <unk> exertion , it is conscience that <unk> us , for it <unk> us with a thousand good <unk> , of which we alone are judges ; and these reasons , <unk> excellent in <unk> sleep , would <unk> us but very little before a <unk> , when we were tried for our lives .
Thus <unk> <unk> . , for instance , was <unk> served by his conscience after the putting away of the two children of Edward <unk> .
; in fact , he could say , ‘ These two children of a cruel and <unk> king , who have <unk> the <unk> of their father , which I alone could perceive in their <unk> <unk> — these two children are <unk> in my way of <unk> the happiness of the English people , whose unhappiness they ( the children ) would <unk> have caused . ’ Thus was Lady <unk> served by her conscience , when she sought to give her son , and not her husband ( whatever <unk> may say ) , a throne .
Ah , <unk> love is a great virtue , a powerful motive — so powerful that it <unk> a multitude of things , even if , after <unk> ’ s death , Lady <unk> had been at all <unk> by her conscience . ” Madame de Villefort listened with <unk> to these <unk> <unk> and horrible <unk> , delivered by the count with that <unk> simplicity which was peculiar to him .
After a moment ’ s silence , the lady inquired : “ Do you know , my dear count , ” she said , “ that you are a very terrible <unk> , and that you look at the world through a somewhat <unk> medium ?
Have you really measured the world by <unk> , or through <unk> and <unk> ?
For you must indeed be a great <unk> , and the <unk> you <unk> to my son , which recalled him to life almost <unk> — — ” <unk> “ Oh , do not place any <unk> on that , madame ; _ one _ drop of that <unk> sufficed to recall life to a dying child , but three drops would have <unk> the blood into his <unk> in such a way as to have produced most violent <unk> ; six would have suspended his <unk> , and caused <unk> more serious than that in which he was ; ten would have destroyed him .
You know , madame , how suddenly I <unk> him from those <unk> which he so <unk> touched ? ” “ Is it then so terrible a poison ? ” “ Oh , no !
In the first place , let us agree that the word poison does not exist , because in <unk> use is made of the most violent <unk> , which become , according as they are employed , most <unk> <unk> . ” “ What , then , is it ? ” “ A skilful preparation of my friend ’ s the worthy Abbé <unk> , who taught me the use of it . ” “ Oh , ” observed Madame de Villefort , “ it must be an admirable <unk> . ” “ <unk> , madame , as you have seen , ” replied the count ; “ and I frequently make use of it — with all possible prudence though , be it observed , ” he added with a smile of intelligence .
“ Most assuredly , ” responded Madame de Villefort in the same tone .
“ As for me , so nervous , and so subject to <unk> <unk> , I should require a <unk> <unk> to <unk> for me some means of breathing freely and <unk> my mind , in the fear I have of dying some fine day of <unk> .
In the meanwhile , as the thing is difficult to find in France , and your abbé is not probably disposed to make a journey to Paris on my account , I must continue to use Monsieur <unk> ’ s <unk> ; and <unk> and <unk> ’ s drops are among my favorite <unk> .
Here are some <unk> which I have made up on purpose ; they are <unk> <unk> strong . ” Monte Cristo opened the <unk> box , which the lady presented to him , and <unk> the odor of the <unk> with the air of an <unk> who thoroughly <unk> their <unk> .
“ They are indeed exquisite , ” he said ; “ but as they are necessarily <unk> to the process of <unk> — a <unk> which it is frequently impossible for a <unk> person to accomplish — I prefer my own <unk> . ” “ <unk> , and so should I prefer it , after the effects I have seen produced ; but of course it is a secret , and I am not so <unk> as to ask it of you . ” “ But I , ” said Monte Cristo , rising as he spoke — “ I am gallant enough to offer it you . ” <unk> “ How kind you are . ” “ Only remember one thing — a small <unk> is a remedy , a large one is poison .
One drop will restore life , as you have seen ; five or six will <unk> kill , and in a way the more terrible <unk> as , poured into a glass of wine , it would not in the slightest degree affect its <unk> .
But I say no more , madame ; it is really as if I were <unk> for you . ” The clock struck half-past six , and a lady was announced , a friend of Madame de Villefort , who came to dine with her .
“ If I had had the honor of seeing you for the third or fourth time , count , instead of only for the second , ” said Madame de Villefort ; “ if I had had the honor of being your friend , instead of only having the happiness of being under an <unk> to you , I should insist on <unk> you to dinner , and not allow myself to be <unk> by a first refusal . ” “ A thousand thanks , madame , ” replied Monte Cristo “ but I have an engagement which I cannot break .
I have promised to <unk> to the <unk> a Greek <unk> of my acquaintance who has never seen your grand <unk> , and who <unk> on me to conduct her thither . ” “ Adieu , then , sir , and do not forget the <unk> . ” “ Ah , in truth , madame , to do that I must forget the hour ’ s conversation I have had with you , which is indeed impossible . ” Monte Cristo bowed , and left the house .
Madame de Villefort remained <unk> in thought .
“ He is a very strange man , ” she said , “ and in my opinion is himself the <unk> he <unk> about . ” As to Monte Cristo the result had <unk> his utmost <unk> .
“ Good , ” said he , as he went away ; “ this is a <unk> soil , and I feel certain that the <unk> <unk> will not be cast on <unk> ground . ” <unk> morning , faithful to his promise , he sent the <unk> requested .
Chapter <unk> .
Robert le <unk> The pretext of an <unk> engagement was so much the more <unk> , as there chanced to be on that very night a more than ordinary <unk> at the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , who had been suffering under severe illness , made his <unk> in the character of _ <unk> _ , and , as usual , the <unk> of the most admired <unk> of the favorite <unk> of the day had attracted a brilliant and fashionable audience .
Morcerf , like most other young men of rank and fortune , had his <unk> <unk> , with the certainty of always finding a seat in at least a dozen of the principal boxes occupied by persons of his acquaintance ; he had , moreover , his right of entry into the <unk> box .
Château-Renaud <unk> a <unk> beside his own , while Beauchamp , as a <unk> , had <unk> <unk> all over the theatre .
It happened that on this particular night the minister ’ s box was placed at the disposal of Lucien Debray , who offered it to the Comte de Morcerf , who again , upon his <unk> of it by Mercédès , sent it to Danglars , with an <unk> that he should probably do himself the honor of <unk> the baroness and her daughter during the evening , in the event of their accepting the box in question .
The ladies received the offer with too much pleasure to dream of a refusal .
To no class of persons is the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> more <unk> than to the wealthy <unk> , who still <unk> <unk> while <unk> of carrying a king ’ s <unk> in his waistcoat pocket .
Danglars had , however , <unk> against showing himself in a <unk> box , <unk> that his political principles , and his <unk> position as member of the opposition party would not permit him so to commit himself ; the baroness had , therefore , <unk> a note to Lucien Debray , <unk> him call for them , it being wholly impossible for her to go alone with Eugénie to the <unk> .
There is no <unk> the fact that a very <unk> construction would have been put upon the circumstance if the two women had gone without <unk> , while the addition of a third , in the person of her mother ’ s admitted lover , enabled Mademoiselle Danglars to <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
One must take the world as one finds it .
<unk> The curtain rose , as usual , to an almost empty house , it being one of the <unk> of Parisian fashion never to appear at the <unk> until after the beginning of the <unk> , so that the first act is generally played without the slightest attention being paid to it , that part of the audience already assembled being too much occupied in observing the fresh <unk> , while nothing is heard but the noise of opening and <unk> doors , and the <unk> of conversation .
“ <unk> , ” said Albert , as the door of a box on the first circle opened , “ that must be the <unk> G — — . ” “ And who is the <unk> G — — ? ” inquired Château-Renaud .
“ What a question !
Now , do you know , baron , I have a great mind to pick a quarrel with you for asking it ; as if all the world did not know who the <unk> G — — was . ” “ Ah , to be sure , ” replied Château-Renaud ; “ the lovely <unk> , is it not ? ” “ <unk> . ” At this moment the countess perceived Albert , and returned his <unk> with a smile .
“ You know her , it seems ? ” said Château-Renaud .
“ Franz introduced me to her at Rome , ” replied Albert .
“ Well , then , will you do as much for me in Paris as Franz did for you in Rome ? ” “ With pleasure . ” There was a cry of “ <unk> up ! ” from the audience .
This <unk> on the part of the spectators of their wish to be allowed to hear the music , produced not the slightest effect on the two young men , who continued their conversation .
“ The countess was present at the <unk> in the <unk> , ” said Château-Renaud .
“ <unk> ? ” “ Yes . ” “ <unk> me , I quite forgot the <unk> .
Did you <unk> ? ” “ Oh , merely a <unk> fifty louis . ” “ And who was the <unk> ? ” “ <unk> .
I <unk> on him . ” “ But there were three <unk> , were there not ? ” “ Yes ; there was the <unk> given by the <unk> <unk> — a gold cup , you know — and a very singular circumstance occurred about that race . ” “ What was it ? ” “ Oh , shut up ! ” again <unk> some of the audience .
“ Why , it was won by a horse and <unk> utterly unknown on the course . ” “ Is that possible ? ” “ True as day .
The fact was , nobody had observed a horse entered by the name of Vampa , or that of a <unk> <unk> <unk> , when , at the last moment , a splendid <unk> , mounted by a <unk> about as big as your fist , presented themselves at the <unk> .
They were obliged to stuff at least twenty pounds weight of shot in the small <unk> ’ s pockets , to make him weight ; but with all that he <unk> <unk> and <unk> , against whom he ran , by at least three whole <unk> . ” “ And was it not found out at last to whom the horse and <unk> belonged ? ” “ No . ” “ You say that the horse was entered under the name of Vampa ? ” “ Exactly ; that was the title . ” “ Then , ” answered Albert , “ I am better informed than you are , and know who the owner of that horse was . ” “ <unk> up , there ! ” cried the <unk> in <unk> .
And this time the tone and manner in which the command was given , <unk> such growing <unk> that the two young men perceived , for the first time , that the <unk> was addressed to them .
<unk> turning round , they calmly scrutinized the various <unk> around them , as though <unk> some one person who would take upon himself the <unk> of what they <unk> excessive <unk> ; but as no one responded to the <unk> , the friends turned again to the front of the theatre , and affected to busy themselves with the stage .
At this moment the door of the minister ’ s box opened , and Madame Danglars , accompanied by her daughter , entered , <unk> by Lucien Debray , who <unk> conducted them to their <unk> .
“ <unk> , <unk> , ” said Château-Renaud , “ here come some friends of yours , viscount !
What are you looking at there ?
don ’ t you see they are trying to catch your eye ? ” Albert turned round , just in time to receive a gracious wave of the <unk> from the baroness ; as for Mademoiselle Eugénie , she scarcely <unk> to waste the glances of her large black eyes even upon the business of the stage .
“ I tell you what , my dear fellow , ” said Château-Renaud , “ I cannot imagine what objection you can possibly have to Mademoiselle Danglars — that is , setting aside her want of <unk> and somewhat inferior rank , which by the way I don ’ t think you care very much about .
Now , <unk> all that , I mean to say she is a <unk> fine girl ! ” “ <unk> , certainly , ” replied Albert , “ but not to my taste , which I confess , <unk> to something <unk> , <unk> , and more <unk> . ” “ Ah , well , ” exclaimed Château-Renaud , who because he had seen his <unk> summer fancied himself <unk> <unk> in <unk> a sort of paternal air with his more youthful friend , “ you young people are never satisfied ; why , what would you have more ?
your parents have chosen you a bride built on the <unk> of <unk> , the <unk> , and yet you are not content . ” “ No , for that very resemblance <unk> me ; I should have liked something more in the manner of the <unk> of <unk> or <unk> ; but this <unk> <unk> , continually surrounded by her <unk> , gives me a sort of alarm lest she should some day bring on me the fate of <unk> . ” And , indeed , it required but one glance at Mademoiselle Danglars to comprehend the <unk> of Morcerf ’ s remark .
She was beautiful , but her beauty was of too marked and decided a character to please a <unk> taste ; her hair was <unk> black , but its natural waves seemed somewhat <unk> ; her eyes , of the same color as her hair , were surmounted by <unk> <unk> , whose great defect , however , consisted in an almost <unk> <unk> , while her whole physiognomy wore that expression of <unk> and decision so little in accordance with the <unk> <unk> of her sex — her nose was precisely what a <unk> would have chosen for a <unk> <unk> .
Her mouth , which might have been found fault with as too large , displayed teeth of <unk> whiteness , rendered still more <unk> by the brilliant <unk> of her lips , <unk> <unk> with her naturally pale complexion .
But that which completed the almost <unk> look Morcerf found so little to his taste , was a dark <unk> , of much larger <unk> than these <unk> of nature generally are , placed just at the corner of her mouth ; and the effect <unk> to increase the expression of <unk> that <unk> her countenance .
The rest of Mademoiselle Eugénie ’ s person was in perfect keeping with the head just described ; she , indeed , reminded one of <unk> , as Château-Renaud observed , but her bearing was more haughty and resolute .
As regarded her <unk> , the only fault to be found with them was the same that a <unk> <unk> might have found with her beauty , that they were somewhat too <unk> and <unk> for so young a person .
She was a perfect <unk> , a <unk> artist , wrote <unk> , and composed music ; to the study of the latter she <unk> to be entirely devoted , following it with an <unk> <unk> , assisted by a <unk> , — a young woman without fortune whose talent promised to <unk> into remarkable powers as a <unk> .
It was <unk> that she was an object of almost paternal interest to one of the principal <unk> of the day , who excited her to spare no pains in the <unk> of her voice , which might <unk> prove a source of wealth and independence .
But this counsel <unk> decided Mademoiselle Danglars never to commit herself by being seen in public with one destined for a <unk> life ; and acting upon this principle , the banker ’ s daughter , though perfectly willing to allow Mademoiselle Louise d ’ <unk> ( that was the name of the young <unk> ) to practice with her through the day , took <unk> care not to be seen in her company .
Still , though not actually received at the Hôtel Danglars in the light of an acknowledged friend , Louise was treated with far more kindness and consideration than is usually bestowed on a <unk> .
The curtain fell almost immediately after the entrance of Madame Danglars into her box , the band quitted the <unk> for the accustomed <unk> ’ s interval allowed between the <unk> , and the audience were left at liberty to <unk> the salon or <unk> , or to pay and receive visits in their <unk> boxes .
Morcerf and Château-Renaud were amongst the first to <unk> themselves of this permission .
For an instant the idea struck Madame Danglars that this eagerness on the part of the young viscount arose from his impatience to join her party , and she whispered her <unk> to her daughter , that Albert was hurrying to pay his respects to them .
Mademoiselle Eugénie , however , merely returned a <unk> movement of the head , while , with a cold smile , she directed the attention of her mother to an opposite box on the first circle , in which sat the <unk> G — — , and where Morcerf had just made his appearance .
<unk> “ So we meet again , my travelling friend , do we ? ” cried the countess , extending her hand to him with all the warmth and <unk> of an old acquaintance ; “ it was really very good of you to recognize me so quickly , and still more so to bestow your first visit on me . ” “ Be assured , ” replied Albert , “ that if I had been aware of your arrival in Paris , and had known your address , I should have paid my respects to you before this .
<unk> me to introduce my friend , Baron de Château-Renaud , one of the few true gentlemen now to be found in France , and from whom I have just learned that you were a <unk> of the <unk> in the <unk> , yesterday . ” Château-Renaud bowed to the countess .
“ So you were at the <unk> , baron ? ” inquired the countess eagerly .
“ Yes , madame . ” “ Well , then , ” pursued Madame G — — with considerable animation , “ you can probably tell me who won the <unk> <unk> <unk> ? ” “ I am sorry to say I cannot , ” replied the baron ; “ and I was just asking the same question of Albert . ” “ Are you very anxious to know , countess ? ” asked Albert .
“ To know what ? ” “ The name of the owner of the <unk> horse ? ” “ <unk> ; only imagine — but do tell me , viscount , whether you really are acquainted with it or no ? ” “ I beg your pardon , madame , but you were about to relate some story , were you not ?
You said , ‘ only imagine , ’ — and then paused .
Pray continue . ” “ Well , then , listen .
You must know I felt so interested in the splendid <unk> horse , with his elegant little <unk> , so <unk> dressed in a pink satin <unk> and cap , that I could not help praying for their success with as much <unk> as though the half of my fortune were at stake ; and when I saw them <unk> all the others , and come to the <unk> in such gallant style , I actually <unk> my hands with joy .
<unk> my surprise , when , upon returning home , the first object I met on the staircase was the <unk> <unk> in the pink <unk> !
I concluded that , by some singular chance , the owner of the <unk> horse must live in the same hotel as myself ; but , as I entered my apartments , I beheld the very gold cup <unk> as a <unk> to the unknown horse and <unk> .
<unk> the cup was a small piece of paper , on which were written these words — ‘ From Lord <unk> to <unk> G — — . ’ ” “ <unk> ; I was sure of it , ” said Morcerf .
“ <unk> of what ? ” “ That the owner of the horse was Lord <unk> himself . ” “ What Lord <unk> do you mean ? ” “ Why , our Lord <unk> — the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> ! ” “ Is it possible ? ” exclaimed the countess ; “ is he here in Paris ? ” “ To be sure , — why not ? ” “ And you visit him ? — meet him at your own house and elsewhere ? ” “ I assure you he is my most intimate friend , and M. de Château-Renaud has also the honor of his acquaintance . ” “ But why are you so sure of his being the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> ? ” “ Was not the <unk> horse entered by the name of Vampa ? ” “ What of that ? ” “ Why , do you not recollect the name of the celebrated bandit by whom I was made prisoner ? ” “ Oh , yes . ” “ And from whose hands the count <unk> me in so wonderful a manner ? ” “ To be sure , I remember it all now . ” “ He called himself Vampa .
You see , it ’ s evident where the count got the name . ” “ But what could have been his motive for sending the cup to me ? ” “ In the first place , because I had spoken much of you to him , as you may believe ; and in the second , because he delighted to see a <unk> take so lively an interest in his success . ” “ I trust and hope you never repeated to the count all the foolish remarks we used to make about him ? ” “ I should not like to <unk> upon oath that I have not .
Besides , his presenting you the cup under the name of Lord <unk> — — ” “ Oh , but that is dreadful !
Why , the man must owe me a fearful <unk> . ” “ Does his action appear like that of an enemy ? ” “ No ; certainly not . ” “ Well , then — — ” “ And so he is in Paris ? ” “ Yes . ” “ And what effect does he produce ? ” “ Why , ” said Albert , “ he was talked about for a week ; then the <unk> of the <unk> of England took place , followed by the theft of Mademoiselle <unk> ’ s diamonds ; and so people talked of something else . ” “ My good fellow , ” said Château-Renaud , “ the count is your friend and you treat him accordingly .
Do not believe what Albert is telling you , countess ; so far from the sensation excited in the Parisian <unk> by the appearance of the Count of Monte Cristo having <unk> , I take upon myself to declare that it is as strong as ever .
His first <unk> act upon coming amongst us was to present a pair of horses , worth <unk> francs , to Madame Danglars ; his second , the almost <unk> <unk> of Madame de Villefort ’ s life ; now it seems that he has carried off the <unk> <unk> by the <unk> <unk> .
I therefore <unk> , in spite of Morcerf , that not only is the count the object of interest at this present moment , but also that he will continue to be so for a month longer if he pleases to <unk> an <unk> of conduct which , after all , may be his ordinary mode of existence . ” “ Perhaps you are right , ” said Morcerf ; “ meanwhile , who is in the <unk> <unk> ’ s box ? ” “ Which box do you mean ? ” asked the countess .
“ The one between the <unk> on the first <unk> — it seems to have been fitted up entirely <unk> . ” “ Did you observe anyone during the first act ? ” asked Château-Renaud .
“ Where ? ” “ In that box . ” “ No , ” replied the countess , “ it was certainly empty during the first act ; ” then , <unk> the subject of their previous conversation , she said , “ And so you really believe it was your mysterious Count of Monte Cristo that gained the <unk> ? ” “ I am sure of it . ” “ And who afterwards sent the cup to me ? ” “ <unk> . ” “ But I don ’ t know him , ” said the countess ; “ I have a great mind to return it . ” “ Do no such thing , I beg of you ; he would only send you another , formed of a magnificent <unk> , or <unk> out of a gigantic <unk> .
It is his way , and you must take him as you find him . ” At this moment the bell rang to announce the drawing up of the curtain for the second act .
Albert rose to return to his place .
“ Shall I see you again ? ” asked the countess .
“ At the end of the next act , with your permission , I will come and inquire whether there is anything I can do for you in Paris ? ” “ Pray take notice , ” said the countess , “ that my present residence is <unk> Rue de <unk> , and that I am at home to my friends every Saturday evening .
So now , you are both <unk> . ” The young men bowed , and quitted the box .
Upon reaching their <unk> , they found the whole of the audience in the <unk> standing up and <unk> their gaze towards the box formerly possessed by the <unk> <unk> .
A man of from <unk> to forty years of age , dressed in deep black , had just entered , accompanied by a young woman dressed after the <unk> style .
The lady was <unk> beautiful , while the rich <unk> of her <unk> drew all eyes upon her .
“ <unk> , ” said Albert ; “ it is Monte Cristo and his Greek ! ” The strangers were , indeed , no other than the count and Haydée .
In a few moments the young girl had attracted the attention of the whole house , and even the <unk> of the boxes leaned forward to <unk> her magnificent diamonds .
The second act passed away during one continued <unk> of voices — one deep whisper — <unk> that some great and <unk> interesting event had occurred ; all eyes , all thoughts , were occupied with the young and beautiful woman , whose <unk> <unk> and splendid jewels made a most extraordinary spectacle .
Upon this occasion an <unk> sign from Madame Danglars <unk> her desire to see Albert in her box directly the curtain fell on the second act , and neither the politeness nor good taste of Morcerf would permit his <unk> an invitation so <unk> given .
At the close of the act he therefore went to the baroness .
Having bowed to the two ladies , he extended his hand to Debray .
By the baroness he was most <unk> welcomed , while Eugénie received him with her accustomed <unk> .
“ My dear fellow , ” said Debray , “ you have come in the <unk> of time .
There is madame <unk> me with questions respecting the count ; she <unk> upon it that I can tell her his birth , education , and <unk> , where he came from , and whither he is going .
<unk> no <unk> of <unk> , I was wholly unable to do this ; so , by way of getting out of the <unk> , I said , ‘ <unk> Morcerf ; he has got the whole history of his beloved Monte Cristo at his fingers ’ ends ; ’ <unk> the baroness signified her desire to see you . ” “ Is it not almost incredible , ” said Madame Danglars , “ that a person having at least half a million of <unk> money at his command , should possess so little information ? ” “ Let me assure you , madame , ” said Lucien , “ that had I really the sum you mention at my disposal , I would <unk> it more <unk> than in <unk> myself to obtain particulars respecting the Count of Monte Cristo , whose only merit in my eyes <unk> in his being twice as rich as a <unk> .
However , I have turned the business over to Morcerf , so pray settle it with him as may be most agreeable to you ; for my own part , I care nothing about the count or his mysterious <unk> . ” <unk> “ I am very sure no <unk> would have sent me a pair of horses worth <unk> francs , wearing on their heads four diamonds <unk> at <unk> francs each . ” “ He seems to have a <unk> for diamonds , ” said Morcerf , smiling , “ and I <unk> believe that , like <unk> , he keeps his pockets filled , for the sake of <unk> them along the road , as <unk> <unk> did his <unk> stones . ” “ Perhaps he has discovered some mine , ” said Madame Danglars .
“ I suppose you know he has an order for <unk> credit on the baron ’ s <unk> establishment ? ” “ I was not aware of it , ” replied Albert , “ but I can readily believe it . ” “ And , further , that he stated to M. Danglars his intention of only staying a year in Paris , during which time he proposed to spend six millions .
“ He must be the <unk> of <unk> , travelling _ <unk> _ . ” “ Have you noticed the remarkable beauty of the young woman , M. Lucien ? ” inquired Eugénie .
“ I really never met with one woman so ready to do justice to the <unk> of another as yourself , ” responded Lucien , raising his <unk> to his eye .
“ A most lovely creature , upon my soul ! ” was his <unk> .
“ Who is this young person , M. de Morcerf ? ” inquired Eugénie ; “ does anybody know ? ” “ Mademoiselle , ” said Albert , replying to this direct appeal , “ I can give you very exact information on that subject , as well as on most points relative to the mysterious person of whom we are now conversing — the young woman is a Greek . ” “ So I should suppose by her dress ; if you know no more than that , everyone here is as <unk> as yourself . ” “ I am extremely sorry you find me so ignorant a _ <unk> _ , ” replied Morcerf , “ but I am <unk> obliged to confess , I have nothing further to communicate — yes , stay , I do know one thing more , <unk> , that she is a <unk> , for one day when I chanced to be <unk> with the count , I heard the sound of a <unk> — it is impossible that it could have been touched by any other finger than her own . ” “ Then your count <unk> visitors , does he ? ” asked Madame Danglars .
“ Indeed he does , and in a most <unk> manner , I can assure you . ” “ I must try and persuade M. Danglars to invite him to a ball or dinner , or something of the sort , that he may be compelled to ask us in return . ” “ What , ” said Debray , laughing ; “ do you really mean you would go to his house ? ” “ Why not ?
my husband could accompany me . ” “ But do you know this mysterious count is a <unk> ? ” “ You have <unk> proof to the contrary , if you look opposite , ” said the baroness , as she <unk> pointed to the beautiful Greek .
“ No , no ! ” exclaimed Debray ; “ that girl is not his wife : he told us himself she was his slave .
Do you not recollect , Morcerf , his telling us so at your breakfast ? ” “ Well , then , ” said the baroness , “ if slave she be , she has all the air and manner of a <unk> . ” “ Of the ‘ Arabian <unk> ’ . ” “ If you like ; but tell me , my dear Lucien , what it is that <unk> a <unk> .
Why , diamonds — and she is covered with them . ” “ To me she seems <unk> , ” observed Eugénie ; “ she would look far better if she wore <unk> , and we should then be able to see her <unk> formed throat and <unk> . ” “ See how the artist <unk> out ! ” exclaimed Madame Danglars .
“ My poor Eugénie , you must conceal your passion for the fine <unk> . ” “ I admire all that is beautiful , ” returned the young lady .
“ What do you think of the count ? ” inquired Debray ; “ he is not much <unk> , according to my ideas of good looks . ” “ The count , ” repeated Eugénie , as though it had not occurred to her to observe him sooner ; “ the count ? — oh , he is so dreadfully pale . ” “ I quite agree with you , ” said Morcerf ; “ and the secret of that very pallor is what we want to find out .
The <unk> G — — <unk> upon it that he is a <unk> . ” “ Then the <unk> G — — has returned to Paris , has she ? ” inquired the baroness .
“ Is that she , <unk> ? ” asked Eugénie ; “ almost opposite to us , with that <unk> of beautiful light hair ? ” “ Yes , ” said Madame Danglars , “ that is she .
Shall I tell you what you ought to do , Morcerf ? ” “ <unk> me , madame . ” “ Well , then , you should go and bring your Count of Monte Cristo to us . ” “ What for ? ” asked Eugénie .
“ What for ?
Why , to <unk> with him , of course .
Have you really no desire to meet him ? ” “ None whatever , ” replied Eugénie .
“ <unk> child , ” murmured the baroness .
“ He will very probably come of his own accord , ” said Morcerf .
“ There ; do you see , madame , he <unk> you , and <unk> . ” The baroness returned the salute in the most smiling and graceful manner .
“ Well , ” said Morcerf , “ I may as well be <unk> , and tear myself away to forward your wishes .
Adieu ; I will go and try if there are any means of speaking to him . ” “ Go straight to his box ; that will be the <unk> plan . ” “ But I have never been presented . ” “ <unk> to whom ? ” “ To the beautiful Greek . ” “ You say she is only a slave ? ” “ While you <unk> that she is a <unk> , or at least a <unk> .
No ; I hope that when he sees me leave you , he will come out . ” “ That is possible — go . ” “ I am going , ” said Albert , as he made his parting bow .
Just as he was passing the count ’ s box , the door opened , and Monte Cristo came forth .
After giving some directions to Ali , who stood in the <unk> , the count took Albert ’ s arm .
<unk> closing the box door , Ali placed himself before it , while a crowd of spectators assembled round the <unk> .
“ Upon my word , ” said Monte Cristo , “ Paris is a strange city , and the <unk> a very singular people .
See that <unk> of persons collected around poor Ali , who is as much astonished as themselves ; really one might suppose he was the only <unk> they had ever beheld .
Now I can promise you , that a Frenchman might show himself in public , either in <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , or <unk> , without being treated in that way . ” “ That shows that the <unk> nations have too much good sense to waste their time and attention on objects <unk> of either .
However , as far as Ali is concerned , I can assure you , the interest he <unk> is merely from the circumstance of his being your attendant — you , who are at this moment the most celebrated and fashionable person in Paris . ” “ Really ?
and what has procured me so <unk> a distinction ? ” “ What ?
why , yourself , to be sure !
You give away horses worth a thousand louis ; you save the lives of ladies of high rank and beauty ; under the name of <unk> <unk> you run <unk> <unk> by tiny <unk> not larger than <unk> ; then , when you have carried off the golden <unk> of victory , instead of setting any value on it , you give it to the first handsome woman you think of ! ” “ And who has filled your head with all this nonsense ? ” “ Why , in the first place , I heard it from Madame Danglars , who , by the by , is dying to see you in her box , or to have you seen there by others ; <unk> , I learned it from Beauchamp ’ s journal ; and <unk> , from my own imagination .
Why , if you sought <unk> , did you call your horse Vampa ? ” “ That was an <unk> , certainly , ” replied the count ; “ but tell me , does the Count of Morcerf never visit the Opera ?
I have been looking for him , but without success . ” “ He will be here tonight . ” “ In what part of the house ? ” “ In the baroness ’ s box , I believe . ” “ That charming young woman with her is her daughter ? ” “ Yes . ” “ I congratulate you . ” Morcerf smiled .
“ We will <unk> that subject at length some future time , ” said he .
“ But what do you think of the music ? ” “ What music ? ” “ Why , the music you have been listening to . ” “ Oh , it is well enough as the <unk> of a human <unk> , <unk> by <unk> <unk> , to <unk> the late <unk> . ” “ From which it would seem , my dear count , that you can at pleasure enjoy the <unk> <unk> that proceed from the seven <unk> of paradise ? ” <unk> “ You are right , in some degree ; when I wish to listen to sounds more <unk> <unk> to <unk> than mortal ear ever yet listened to , I go to sleep . ” “ Then sleep here , my dear count .
The conditions are favorable ; what else was <unk> invented for ? ” “ No , thank you .
Your <unk> is too <unk> .
To sleep after the manner I speak of , absolute calm and silence are necessary , and then a certain preparation — — ” “ I know — the famous <unk> ! ” “ <unk> .
So , my dear viscount , whenever you wish to be <unk> with music come and <unk> with me . ” “ I have already enjoyed that treat when <unk> with you , ” said Morcerf .
“ Do you mean at Rome ? ” “ I do . ” “ Ah , then , I suppose you heard Haydée ’ s <unk> ; the poor <unk> frequently <unk> a weary hour in playing over to me the <unk> of her native land . ” Morcerf did not pursue the subject , and Monte Cristo himself fell into a silent reverie .
The bell rang at this moment for the rising of the curtain .
“ You will excuse my leaving you , ” said the count , turning in the direction of his box .
“ What ?
Are you going ? ” “ Pray , say everything that is kind to <unk> G — — on the part of her friend the <unk> . ” “ And what message shall I convey to the baroness ! ” “ That , with her permission , I shall do myself the honor of paying my respects in the course of the evening . ” The third act had begun ; and during its progress the Count of Morcerf , according to his promise , made his appearance in the box of Madame Danglars .
The Count of Morcerf was not a person to excite either interest or curiosity in a place of public amusement ; his presence , therefore , was wholly <unk> , save by the <unk> of the box in which he had just seated himself .
The quick eye of Monte Cristo however , marked his coming ; and a slight though meaning smile passed over his lips .
Haydée , whose soul seemed <unk> in the business of the stage , like all <unk> natures , delighted in whatever addressed itself to the eye or ear .
<unk> The third act passed off as usual .
<unk> <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> executed the <unk> <unk> ; Robert <unk> <unk> the Prince of <unk> ; and the royal father of the <unk> Isabella , taking his daughter by the hand , swept round the stage with <unk> <unk> , the better to display the rich folds of his velvet <unk> and mantle .
After which the curtain again fell , and the spectators poured forth from the theatre into the <unk> and salon .
The count left his box , and a moment later was <unk> the <unk> Danglars , who could not restrain a cry of mingled pleasure and surprise .
“ You are welcome , count ! ” she exclaimed , as he entered .
“ I have been most anxious to see you , that I might repeat <unk> the thanks writing can so ill express . ” “ <unk> so trifling a circumstance cannot deserve a place in your remembrance .
Believe me , madame , I had entirely forgotten it . ” “ But it is not so easy to forget , monsieur , that the very next day after your <unk> gift you saved the life of my dear friend , Madame de Villefort , which was <unk> by the very animals your <unk> restored to me . ” <unk> “ This time , at least , I do not deserve your thanks .
It was Ali , my <unk> slave , who rendered this service to Madame de Villefort . ” “ Was it Ali , ” asked the Count of Morcerf , “ who <unk> my son from the hands of bandits ? ” “ No , count , ” replied Monte Cristo taking the hand held out to him by the general ; “ in this instance I may fairly and freely accept your thanks ; but you have already <unk> them , and fully discharged your debt — if indeed there existed one — and I feel almost <unk> to find you still <unk> to the subject .
May I beg of you , baroness , to honor me with an introduction to your daughter ? ” “ Oh , you are no stranger — at least not by name , ” replied Madame Danglars , “ and the last two or three days we have really talked of nothing but you .
Eugénie , ” continued the baroness , turning towards her daughter , “ this is the Count of Monte Cristo . ” The count bowed , while Mademoiselle Danglars bent her head slightly .
“ You have a charming young person with you tonight , count , ” said Eugénie .
“ Is she your daughter ? ” “ No , mademoiselle , ” said Monte Cristo , astonished at the coolness and freedom of the question .
“ She is a poor unfortunate Greek left under my care . ” “ And what is her name ? ” “ Haydée , ” replied Monte Cristo .
“ A Greek ? ” murmured the Count of Morcerf .
“ Yes , indeed , count , ” said Madame Danglars ; “ and tell me , did you ever see at the court of Ali <unk> , whom you so <unk> and <unk> served , a more exquisite beauty or <unk> costume ? ” “ Did I hear rightly , monsieur , ” said Monte Cristo “ that you served at Yanina ? ” “ I was <unk> of the <unk> ’ s troops , ” replied Morcerf ; “ and it is no secret that I owe my fortune , such as it is , to the <unk> of the illustrious <unk> chief . ” “ But look ! ” exclaimed Madame Danglars .
“ Where ? ” stammered Morcerf .
“ There , ” said Monte Cristo placing his arms around the count , and leaning with him over the front of the box , just as Haydée , whose eyes were occupied in examining the theatre in search of her <unk> , perceived his pale features close to Morcerf ’ s face .
It was as if the young girl beheld the head of <unk> .
She bent <unk> as though to assure herself of the reality of what she saw , then , uttering a faint cry , threw herself back in her seat .
The sound was heard by the people about Ali , who instantly opened the <unk> .
“ Why , count , ” exclaimed Eugénie , “ what has happened to your <unk> ?
she seems to have been taken suddenly ill . “ Very probably , ” answered the count .
“ But do not be alarmed on her account .
Haydée ’ s nervous system is <unk> <unk> , and she is peculiarly <unk> to the <unk> even of flowers — nay , there are some which cause her to faint if brought into her presence .
However , ” continued Monte Cristo , drawing a small <unk> from his pocket , “ I have an <unk> remedy . ” So saying , he bowed to the baroness and her daughter , exchanged a parting shake of the hand with Debray and the count , and left Madame Danglars ’ box .
Upon his return to Haydée he found her still very pale .
As soon as she saw him she seized his hand ; her own hands were <unk> and <unk> cold .
“ Who was it you were talking with over there ? ” she asked .
“ With the Count of Morcerf , ” answered Monte Cristo .
“ He tells me he served your illustrious father , and that he <unk> his fortune to him . ” “ <unk> ! ” exclaimed Haydée , her eyes <unk> with rage ; “ he sold my father to the <unk> , and the fortune he <unk> of was the price of his <unk> !
Did not you know that , my dear lord ? ” “ Something of this I heard in <unk> , ” said Monte Cristo ; “ but the particulars are still unknown to me .
You shall relate them to me , my child .
They are , no doubt , both curious and interesting . ” “ Yes , yes ; but let us go .
I feel as though it would kill me to remain long near that dreadful man . ” So saying , Haydée arose , and <unk> herself in her <unk> of white <unk> embroidered with pearls and <unk> , she hastily quitted the box at the moment when the curtain was rising upon the fourth act .
“ Do you observe , ” said the <unk> G — — to Albert , who had returned to her side , “ that man does nothing like other people ; he <unk> most <unk> to the third act of _ Robert le <unk> _ , and when the fourth begins , takes his departure . ” Chapter <unk> .
A <unk> in <unk> Some days after this meeting , Albert de Morcerf visited the Count of Monte Cristo at his house in the Champs-Élysées , which had already assumed that <unk> appearance which the count ’ s <unk> fortune enabled him to give even to his most <unk> <unk> .
He came to <unk> the thanks of Madame Danglars which had been already conveyed to the count through the medium of a letter , signed “ <unk> Danglars , _ <unk> _ <unk> de <unk> . ” Albert was accompanied by Lucien Debray , who , <unk> in his friend ’ s conversation , added some passing compliments , the source of which the count ’ s talent for <unk> easily enabled him to guess .
He was convinced that Lucien ’ s visit was due to a double feeling of curiosity , the larger half of which sentiment <unk> from the Rue de la <unk> d ’ <unk> .
In short , Madame Danglars , not being able <unk> to examine in detail the domestic <unk> and household arrangements of a man who gave away horses worth <unk> francs and who went to the <unk> with a Greek slave wearing diamonds to the amount of a million of money , had <unk> those eyes , by which she was accustomed to see , to give her a faithful account of the mode of life of this <unk> person .
But the count did not appear to suspect that there could be the slightest connection between Lucien ’ s visit and the curiosity of the baroness .
“ You are in constant communication with the Baron Danglars ? ” the count inquired of Albert de Morcerf .
“ Yes , count , you know what I told you ? ” “ All remains the same , then , in that quarter ? ” “ It is more than ever a settled thing , ” said Lucien , — and , considering that this remark was all that he was at that time called upon to make , he <unk> the glass to his eye , and <unk> the top of his gold <unk> cane , began to make the tour of the apartment , examining the arms and the <unk> .
“ Ah , ” said Monte Cristo “ I did not expect that the affair would be so <unk> concluded . ” “ Oh , things take their course without our assistance .
While we are forgetting them , they are falling into their appointed order ; and when , again , our attention is directed to them , we are surprised at the progress they have made towards the proposed end .
My father and M. Danglars served together in Spain , my father in the army and M. Danglars in the <unk> <unk> .
It was there that my father , ruined by the revolution , and M. Danglars , who never had possessed any <unk> , both laid the <unk> of their different <unk> . ” “ Yes , ” said Monte Cristo “ I think M. Danglars mentioned that in a visit which I paid him ; and , ” continued he , casting a <unk> at Lucien , who was turning over the leaves of an <unk> , “ Mademoiselle Eugénie is pretty — I think I remember that to be her name . ” “ Very pretty , or rather , very beautiful , ” replied Albert , “ but of that style of beauty which I do not <unk> ; I am an <unk> fellow . ” “ You speak as if you were already her husband . ” “ Ah , ” returned Albert , in his turn looking around to see what Lucien was doing .
“ Really , ” said Monte Cristo , <unk> his voice , “ you do not appear to me to be very enthusiastic on the subject of this marriage . ” “ Mademoiselle Danglars is too rich for me , ” replied Morcerf , “ and that <unk> me . ” “ Bah , ” exclaimed Monte Cristo , “ that ’ s a fine reason to give .
Are you not rich yourself ? ” “ My father ’ s income is about <unk> francs per <unk> ; and he will give me , perhaps , ten or twelve thousand when I marry . ” “ That , perhaps , might not be considered a large sum , in Paris especially , ” said the count ; “ but everything does not depend on wealth , and it is a fine thing to have a good name , and to occupy a high station in society .
Your name is celebrated , your position magnificent ; and then the Comte de Morcerf is a soldier , and it is pleasing to see the <unk> of a <unk> united to the poverty of a <unk> ; <unk> is the <unk> ray in which a noble sword can <unk> .
As for me , I consider the union with Mademoiselle Danglars a most suitable one ; she will <unk> you , and you will <unk> her . ” Albert shook his head , and looked thoughtful .
“ There is still something else , ” said he .
“ I confess , ” observed Monte Cristo , “ that I have some difficulty in <unk> your objection to a young lady who is both rich and beautiful . ” “ Oh , ” said Morcerf , “ this <unk> , if <unk> it may be called , is not all on my side . ” “ <unk> can it arise , then ?
for you told me your father desired the marriage . ” “ It is my mother who <unk> ; she has a clear and penetrating judgment , and does not smile on the proposed union .
I cannot account for it , but she seems to entertain some <unk> against the Danglars . ” <unk> “ Ah , ” said the count , in a somewhat forced tone , “ that may be easily explained ; the <unk> de Morcerf , who is <unk> and <unk> itself , does not <unk> the idea of being <unk> by your marriage with one of <unk> birth ; that is natural enough . ” “ I do not know if that is her reason , ” said Albert , “ but one thing I do know , that if this marriage be <unk> , it will render her quite miserable .
There was to have been a meeting six weeks ago in order to talk over and settle the affair ; but I had such a sudden attack of <unk> — — ” “ <unk> ? ” interrupted the count , smiling .
“ Oh , real enough , from anxiety doubtless , — at any rate they <unk> the matter for two months .
There is no hurry , you know .
I am not yet <unk> , and Eugénie is only seventeen ; but the two months <unk> next week .
It must be done .
My dear count , you cannot imagine how my mind is <unk> .
How happy you are in being exempt from all this ! ” “ Well , and why should not you be free , too ?
What <unk> you from being so ? ” “ Oh , it will be too great a disappointment to my father if I do not marry Mademoiselle Danglars . ” “ <unk> her then , ” said the count , with a significant <unk> of the shoulders .
“ Yes , ” replied Morcerf , “ but that will <unk> my mother into <unk> grief . ” “ Then do not marry her , ” said the count .
“ Well , I shall see .
I will try and think over what is the best thing to be done ; you will give me your advice , will you not , and if possible <unk> me from my unpleasant position ?
I think , rather than give pain to my dear mother , I would run the risk of <unk> the count . ” Monte Cristo turned away ; he seemed moved by this last remark .
“ Ah , ” said he to Debray , who had thrown himself into an <unk> at the <unk> extremity of the salon , and who held a <unk> in his right hand and an account book in his left , “ what are you doing there ?
Are you making a <unk> after <unk> ? ” “ Oh , no , ” was the tranquil <unk> ; “ I am too fond of art to attempt anything of that sort .
I am doing a little sum in <unk> . ” “ In <unk> ? ” “ Yes ; I am <unk> — by the way , Morcerf , that <unk> concerns you — I am <unk> what the house of Danglars must have gained by the last rise in <unk> bonds ; from <unk> they have risen to <unk> in three days , and the prudent banker had purchased at <unk> ; therefore he must have made <unk> livres . ” “ That is not his <unk> <unk> , ” said Morcerf ; “ did he not make a million in <unk> this last year ? ” “ My dear fellow , ” said Lucien , “ here is the Count of Monte Cristo , who will say to you , as the <unk> do , — “ ‘ <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> . ’ <unk> “ When they tell me such things , I only <unk> my shoulders and say nothing . ” “ But you were speaking of <unk> ? ” said Monte Cristo .
“ Ah , <unk> , — that is quite another thing !
<unk> are the _ <unk> _ of French <unk> .
We may like <unk> , delight in <unk> , be <unk> with <unk> , and yet grow tired of them all ; but we always come back to _ <unk> _ — it is not only a game , it is a _ <unk> ’ <unk> _ !
M. Danglars sold yesterday at <unk> , and pockets <unk> francs .
Had he but waited till today , the price would have fallen to <unk> , and instead of <unk> <unk> francs , he would have lost <unk> or <unk> . ” “ And what has caused the sudden fall from <unk> to <unk> ? ” asked Monte Cristo .
“ I am profoundly ignorant of all these <unk> <unk> . ” “ Because , ” said Albert , laughing , “ one piece of news follows another , and there is often great <unk> between them . ” “ Ah , ” said the count , “ I see that M. Danglars is accustomed to play at <unk> or losing <unk> francs in a day ; he must be <unk> rich . ” “ It is not he who plays ! ” exclaimed Lucien ; “ it is Madame Danglars ; she is indeed daring . ” “ But you who are a reasonable being , Lucien , and who knows how little <unk> is to be placed on the news , since you are at the <unk> , surely you ought to prevent it , ” said Morcerf , with a smile .
“ How can I , if her husband <unk> in <unk> her ? ” asked Lucien ; “ you know the character of the baroness — no one has any influence with her , and she does precisely what she pleases . ” “ Ah , if I were in your place — — ” said Albert .
“ Well ? ” “ I would <unk> her ; it would be <unk> a service to her future <unk> . ” “ How would you set about it ? ” “ Ah , that would be easy enough — I would give her a lesson . ” “ A lesson ? ” “ Yes .
Your position as secretary to the minister renders your authority great on the subject of political news ; you never open your mouth but the <unk> immediately <unk> your words .
<unk> her to lose a hundred thousand francs , and that would teach her prudence . ” “ I do not understand , ” stammered Lucien .
“ It is very clear , notwithstanding , ” replied the young man , with an <unk> wholly free from <unk> ; “ tell her some fine morning an <unk> piece of intelligence — some <unk> <unk> , of which you alone are in possession ; for instance , that <unk> <unk> .
was seen yesterday at <unk> ’ s .
That would <unk> the <unk> ; she will buy heavily , and she will certainly lose when Beauchamp <unk> the following day , in his <unk> , ‘ The report <unk> by some usually <unk> persons that the king was seen yesterday at <unk> ’ s house , is totally without foundation .
We can positively <unk> that his majesty did not quit the <unk> . ’ ” Lucien half smiled .
Monte Cristo , although apparently indifferent , had not lost one word of this conversation , and his penetrating eye had even read a hidden secret in the embarrassed manner of the secretary .
This embarrassment had completely escaped Albert , but it caused Lucien to <unk> his visit ; he was evidently ill at ease .
The count , in taking leave of him , said something in a low voice , to which he answered , “ <unk> , count ; I accept . ” The count returned to young Morcerf .
“ Do you not think , on reflection , ” said he to him , “ that you have done wrong in thus speaking of your <unk> in the presence of M. Debray ? ” “ My dear count , ” said Morcerf , “ I beg of you not to apply that title so <unk> . ” “ Now , speaking without any <unk> , is your mother really so very much <unk> to this marriage ? ” “ So much so that the baroness very rarely comes to the house , and my mother , has not , I think , visited Madame Danglars twice in her whole life . ” “ Then , ” said the count , “ I am <unk> to speak <unk> to you .
M. Danglars is my banker ; M. de Villefort has overwhelmed me with politeness in return for a service which a <unk> piece of good fortune enabled me to render him .
I <unk> from all this an <unk> of <unk> and <unk> .
Now , in order not to presume on this , and also to be beforehand with them , I have , if agreeable to you , thought of <unk> M. and Madame Danglars , and M. and Madame de Villefort , to my <unk> at Auteuil .
If I were to invite you and the Count and <unk> of Morcerf to this dinner , I should give it the appearance of being a <unk> meeting , or at least Madame de Morcerf would look upon the affair in that light , especially if Baron Danglars did me the honor to bring his daughter .
In that case your mother would hold me in <unk> , and I do not at all wish that ; on the contrary , I desire to stand high in her esteem . ” “ Indeed , count , ” said Morcerf , “ I thank you sincerely for having used so much <unk> towards me , and I <unk> accept the <unk> which you propose .
You say you desire my mother ’ s good opinion ; I assure you it is already yours to a very unusual extent . ” <unk> “ Do you think so ? ” said Monte Cristo , with interest .
“ Oh , I am sure of it ; we talked of you an hour after you left us the other day .
But to return to what we were saying .
If my mother could know of this attention on your part — and I will venture to tell her — I am sure that she will be most grateful to you ; it is true that my father will be equally angry . ” The count laughed .
“ Well , ” said he to Morcerf , “ but I think your father will not be the only angry one ; M. and Madame Danglars will think me a very <unk> person .
They know that I am intimate with you — that you are , in fact ; one of the <unk> of my Parisian <unk> — and they will not find you at my house ; they will certainly ask me why I did not invite you .
Be sure to provide yourself with some previous engagement which shall have a <unk> of probability , and communicate the fact to me by a line in writing .
You know that with <unk> nothing but a written <unk> will be <unk> . ” “ I will do better than that , ” said Albert ; “ my mother is wishing to go to the <unk> — what day is fixed for your dinner ? ” “ Saturday . ” “ This is Tuesday — well , tomorrow evening we leave , and the day after we shall be at <unk> .
Really , count , you have a delightful way of setting people at their ease . ” “ Indeed , you give me more credit than I deserve ; I only wish to do what will be agreeable to you , that is all . ” “ When shall you send your <unk> ? ” “ This very day . ” “ Well , I will immediately call on M. Danglars , and tell him that my mother and myself must leave Paris tomorrow .
I have not seen you , consequently I know nothing of your dinner . ” “ How foolish you are !
Have you forgotten that M. Debray has just seen you at my house ? ” “ Ah , true . ” “ <unk> it this way .
I have seen you , and invited you without any ceremony , when you instantly answered that it would be impossible for you to accept , as you were going to <unk> . ” “ Well , then , that is settled ; but you will come and call on my mother before tomorrow ? ” “ Before tomorrow ? — that will be a difficult matter to arrange , besides , I shall just be in the way of all the <unk> for departure . ” “ Well , you can do better .
You were only a charming man before , but , if you <unk> to my proposal , you will be <unk> . ” “ What must I do to <unk> such <unk> ? ” “ You are today free as air — come and dine with me ; we shall be a small party — only yourself , my mother , and I.
You have scarcely seen my mother ; you shall have an opportunity of observing her more closely .
She is a remarkable woman , and I only regret that there does not exist another like her , about twenty years younger ; in that case , I assure you , there would very soon be a <unk> and <unk> of Morcerf .
As to my father , you will not see him ; he is <unk> engaged , and <unk> with the chief <unk> .
We will talk over our <unk> ; and you , who have seen the whole world , will relate your adventures — you shall tell us the history of the beautiful Greek who was with you the other night at the Opera , and whom you call your slave , and yet treat like a <unk> .
We will talk Italian and Spanish .
Come , accept my invitation , and my mother will thank you . ” “ A thousand thanks , ” said the count , “ your invitation is most gracious , and I regret exceedingly that it is not in my power to accept it .
I am not so much at liberty as you suppose ; on the contrary , I have a most important engagement . ” “ Ah , take care , you were <unk> me just now how , in case of an invitation to dinner , one might <unk> make an excuse .
I require the proof of a <unk> .
I am not a banker , like M. Danglars , but I am quite as <unk> as he is . ” “ I am going to give you a proof , ” replied the count , and he rang the bell .
“ <unk> , ” said Morcerf , “ this is the second time you have refused to dine with my mother ; it is evident that you wish to avoid her . ” Monte Cristo started .
“ Oh , you do not mean that , ” said he ; “ besides , here comes the <unk> of my <unk> . ” Baptistin entered , and remained standing at the door .
“ I had no previous knowledge of your visit , had I ? ” “ Indeed , you are such an extraordinary person , that I would not answer for it . ” “ At all events , I could not guess that you would invite me to dinner . ” “ <unk> not . ” “ Well , listen , Baptistin , what did I tell you this morning when I called you into my laboratory ? ” “ To close the door against visitors as soon as the clock struck five , ” replied the valet .
“ What then ? ” “ Ah , my dear count , ” said Albert .
“ No , no , I wish to do away with that mysterious reputation that you have given me , my dear viscount ; it is <unk> to be always acting <unk> .
I wish my life to be free and open .
Go on , Baptistin . ” “ Then to admit no one except <unk> <unk> Cavalcanti and his son . ” “ You hear — <unk> <unk> Cavalcanti — a man who ranks amongst the most ancient nobility of Italy , whose name <unk> has celebrated in the <unk> <unk> of _ The <unk> _ , you remember it , do you not ?
Then there is his son , Andrea , a charming young man , about your own age , viscount , bearing the same title as yourself , and who is making his entry into the Parisian world , <unk> by his father ’ s millions .
The major will bring his son with him this evening , the _ <unk> _ , as we say in Italy ; he <unk> him to my care .
If he <unk> himself worthy of it , I will do what I can to advance his interests .
You will assist me in the work , will you not ? ” “ Most undoubtedly .
This <unk> Cavalcanti is an old friend of yours , then ? ” “ By no means .
He is a perfect <unk> , very <unk> , modest , and agreeable , such as may be found constantly in Italy , <unk> of very ancient families .
I have met him several times at <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and he has now communicated to me the fact of his arrival in Paris .
The <unk> one makes in travelling have a sort of claim on one ; they everywhere expect to receive the same attention which you once paid them by chance , as though the <unk> of a passing hour were likely to <unk> any <unk> interest in favor of the man in whose society you may happen to be thrown in the course of your journey .
This good <unk> Cavalcanti is come to take a second view of Paris , which he only saw in passing through in the time of the Empire , when he was on his way to <unk> .
I shall give him a good dinner , he will <unk> his son to my care , I will promise to watch over him , I shall let him follow in whatever path his folly may lead him , and then I shall have done my part . ” “ Certainly ; I see you are a <unk> <unk> , ” said Albert “ Good-bye , we shall return on Sunday .
By the way , I have received news of Franz . ” “ Have you ?
Is he still amusing himself in Italy ? ” “ I believe so ; however , he <unk> your absence extremely .
He says you were the sun of Rome , and that without you all appears dark and <unk> ; I do not know if he does not even go so far as to say that it <unk> . ” “ His opinion of me is altered for the better , then ? ” “ No , he still <unk> in looking upon you as the most <unk> and mysterious of beings . ” “ He is a charming young man , ” said Monte Cristo “ and I felt a lively interest in him the very first evening of my introduction , when I met him in search of a supper , and prevailed upon him to accept a portion of mine .
He is , I think , the son of General d ’ Épinay ? ” “ He is . ” “ The same who was so <unk> assassinated in 1815 ? ” “ By the <unk> . ” “ Yes .
Really I like him extremely ; is there not also a <unk> engagement contemplated for him ? ” “ Yes , he is to marry Mademoiselle de Villefort . ” “ Indeed ? ” <unk> “ And you know I am to marry Mademoiselle Danglars , ” said Albert , laughing .
“ You smile . ” “ Yes . ” “ Why do you do so ? ” “ I smile because there appears to me to be about as much inclination for the <unk> of the engagement in question as there is for my own .
But really , my dear count , we are talking as much of women as they do of us ; it is <unk> . ” Albert rose .
“ Are you going ? ” “ Really , that is a good idea ! — two hours have I been <unk> you to death with my company , and then you , with the greatest politeness , ask me if I am going .
Indeed , count , you are the most polished man in the world .
And your servants , too , how very well behaved they are ; there is quite a style about them .
Monsieur Baptistin especially ; I could never get such a man as that .
My servants seem to <unk> those you sometimes see in a play , who , because they have only a word or two to say , <unk> themselves in the most awkward manner possible .
<unk> , if you part with M. Baptistin , give me the refusal of him . ” “ By all means . ” “ That is not all ; give my compliments to your illustrious <unk> , <unk> of the Cavalcanti ; and if by any chance he should be wishing to <unk> his son , find him a wife very rich , very noble on her mother ’ s side at least , and a baroness in right of her father , I will help you in the search . ” “ Ah , <unk> ; you will do as much as that , will you ? ” “ Yes . ” “ Well , really , nothing is certain in this world . ” “ Oh , count , what a service you might render me !
I should like you a hundred times better if , by your <unk> , I could manage to remain a <unk> , even were it only for ten years . ” “ Nothing is impossible , ” gravely replied Monte Cristo ; and taking leave of Albert , he returned into the house , and struck the <unk> three times .
Bertuccio appeared .
“ Monsieur Bertuccio , you understand that I intend <unk> company on Saturday at Auteuil . ” Bertuccio slightly started .
“ I shall require your services to see that all be properly arranged .
It is a beautiful house , or at all events may be made so . ” “ There must be a good deal done before it can deserve that title , your excellency , for the <unk> <unk> are very old . ” “ Let them all be taken away and changed , then , with the exception of the <unk> which is hung with red damask ; you will leave that exactly as it is . ” Bertuccio bowed .
“ You will not touch the garden either ; as to the yard , you may do what you please with it ; I should prefer that being altered beyond all <unk> . ” “ I will do everything in my power to carry out your wishes , your excellency .
I should be glad , however , to receive your excellency ’ s <unk> concerning the dinner . ” “ Really , my dear M. Bertuccio , ” said the count , “ since you have been in Paris , you have become quite nervous , and apparently out of your element ; you no longer seem to understand me . ” “ But surely your excellency will be so good as to inform me whom you are expecting to receive ? ” “ I do not yet know myself , neither is it necessary that you should do so .
‘ <unk> <unk> with <unk> , ’ that is quite sufficient . ” Bertuccio bowed , and left the room .
Chapter <unk> .
<unk> Cavalcanti Both the count and Baptistin had told the truth when they announced to Morcerf the proposed visit of the major , which had served Monte Cristo as a pretext for <unk> Albert ’ s invitation .
<unk> o ’ clock had just struck , and M. Bertuccio , according to the command which had been given him , had two hours before left for Auteuil , when a cab stopped at the door , and after <unk> its <unk> at the gate , immediately hurried away , as if ashamed of its employment .
The visitor was about <unk> years of age , dressed in one of the green <unk> , ornamented with black <unk> , which have so long <unk> their <unk> all over Europe .
He wore trousers of blue cloth , boots tolerably clean , but not of the <unk> <unk> , and a little too thick in the <unk> , <unk> gloves , a hat somewhat resembling in shape those usually worn by the gendarmes , and a black cravat <unk> with white , which , if the <unk> had not worn it of his own free will , might have passed for a <unk> , so much did it resemble one .
Such was the picturesque costume of the person who rang at the gate , and demanded if it was not at No .
30 in the <unk> des Champs-Élysées that the Count of Monte Cristo lived , and who , being answered by the porter in the <unk> , entered , closed the gate after him , and began to ascend the steps .
The small and <unk> head of this man , his white hair and thick gray <unk> , caused him to be easily recognized by Baptistin , who had received an exact description of the expected visitor , and who was awaiting him in the hall .
<unk> , scarcely had the stranger time to pronounce his name before the count was <unk> of his arrival .
He was <unk> into a simple and elegant drawing-room , and the count rose to meet him with a smiling air .
“ Ah , my dear sir , you are most welcome ; I was expecting you . ” “ Indeed , ” said the Italian , “ was your excellency then aware of my visit ? ” “ Yes ; I had been told that I should see you today at seven o ’ clock . ” “ Then you have received full information concerning my arrival ? ” “ Of course . ” “ Ah , so much the better , I feared this little precaution might have been forgotten . ” <unk> “ What precaution ? ” “ That of <unk> you beforehand of my coming . ” “ Oh , no , it has not . ” “ But you are sure you are not mistaken . ” “ Very sure . ” “ It really was I whom your excellency expected at seven o ’ clock this evening ? ” “ I will prove it to you beyond a doubt . ” “ Oh , no , never mind that , ” said the Italian ; “ it is not worth the trouble . ” “ Yes , yes , ” said Monte Cristo .
His visitor appeared slightly uneasy .
“ Let me see , ” said the count ; “ are you not the Marquis <unk> Cavalcanti ? ” “ <unk> Cavalcanti , ” <unk> replied the Italian ; “ yes , I am really he . ” “ <unk> in the <unk> service ? ” “ Was I a major ? ” <unk> asked the old soldier .
“ Yes , ” said Monte Cristo “ you were a major ; that is the title the French give to the post which you filled in Italy . ” “ Very good , ” said the major , “ I do not demand more , you understand — — ” “ Your visit here today is not of your own <unk> , is it ? ” said Monte Cristo .
“ No , certainly not . ” “ You were sent by some other person ? ” “ Yes . ” “ By the excellent Abbé Busoni ? ” “ Exactly so , ” said the delighted major .
“ And you have a letter ? ” “ Yes , there it is . ” “ Give it to me , then . ” And Monte Cristo took the letter , which he opened and read .
The major looked at the count with his large staring eyes , and then took a <unk> of the apartment , but his gaze almost immediately <unk> to the <unk> of the room .
“ Yes , yes , I see .
‘ <unk> Cavalcanti , a worthy <unk> of <unk> , a <unk> of the Cavalcanti of <unk> , ’ ” continued Monte Cristo , reading aloud , “ ‘ <unk> an income of half a million . ’ ” Monte Cristo raised his eyes from the paper , and bowed .
“ Half a million , ” said he , “ magnificent ! ” “ Half a million , is it ? ” said the major .
“ Yes , in so many words ; and it must be so , for the abbé knows <unk> the amount of all the <unk> <unk> in Europe . ” “ Be it half a million , then ; but on my word of honor , I had no idea that it was so much . ” “ Because you are robbed by your steward .
You must make some <unk> in that quarter . ” “ You have opened my eyes , ” said the Italian gravely ; “ I will show the gentlemen the door . ” Monte Cristo resumed the <unk> of the letter : “ ‘ And who only needs one thing more to make him happy . ’ ” “ Yes , indeed but one ! ” said the major with a sigh .
“ ‘ Which is to recover a lost and adored son . ’ ” “ A lost and adored son ! ” “ ‘ <unk> away in his <unk> , either by an enemy of his noble family or by the <unk> . ’ ” “ At the age of five years ! ” said the major with a deep sigh , and raising his eye to heaven .
“ <unk> father , ” said Monte Cristo .
The count continued : “ ‘ I have given him renewed life and hope , in the assurance that you have the power of <unk> the son whom he has <unk> sought for fifteen years . ’ ” The major looked at the count with an indescribable expression of anxiety .
“ I have the power of so doing , ” said Monte Cristo .
The major recovered his <unk> .
“ So , then , ” said he , “ the letter was true to the end ? ” “ Did you doubt it , my dear Monsieur <unk> ? ” “ No , indeed ; certainly not ; a good man , a man holding religious office , as does the Abbé Busoni , could not <unk> to deceive or play off a joke ; but your excellency has not read all . ” “ Ah , true , ” said Monte Cristo “ there is a <unk> . ” “ Yes , yes , ” repeated the major , “ yes — there — is — a — <unk> . ” “ ‘ In order to save <unk> Cavalcanti the trouble of drawing on his banker , I send him a <unk> for <unk> francs to <unk> his travelling expenses , and credit on you for the further sum of <unk> francs , which you still owe me . ’ ” The major awaited the conclusion of the <unk> , apparently with great anxiety .
“ Very good , ” said the count .
“ He said ‘ very good , ’ ” muttered the major , “ then — sir — — ” replied he .
“ Then what ? ” asked Monte Cristo .
“ Then the <unk> — — ” “ Well ; what of the <unk> ? ” “ Then the <unk> is as <unk> received by you as the rest of the letter ? ” “ Certainly ; the Abbé Busoni and myself have a small account open between us .
I do not remember if it is exactly <unk> francs , which I am still owing him , but I dare say we shall not <unk> the difference .
You attached great importance , then , to this <unk> , my dear Monsieur Cavalcanti ? ” “ I must explain to you , ” said the major , “ that , fully <unk> in the signature of the Abbé Busoni , I had not provided myself with any other <unk> ; so that if this resource had failed me , I should have found myself very <unk> situated in Paris . ” “ Is it possible that a man of your standing should be embarrassed anywhere ? ” said Monte Cristo .
“ Why , really I know no one , ” said the major .
“ But then you yourself are known to others ? ” “ Yes , I am known , so that — — ” “ <unk> , my dear Monsieur Cavalcanti . ” “ So that you will <unk> to me these <unk> francs ? ” “ Certainly , at your first request . ” The major ’ s eyes <unk> with pleasing astonishment .
“ But sit down , ” said Monte Cristo ; “ really I do not know what I have been thinking of — I have positively kept you standing for the last quarter of an hour . ” “ Don ’ t mention it . ” The major drew an armchair towards him , and proceeded to seat himself .
“ Now , ” said the count , “ what will you take — a glass of <unk> , port , or <unk> ? ” “ <unk> , if you please ; it is my favorite wine . ” “ I have some that is very good .
You will take a <unk> with it , will you not ? ” “ Yes , I will take a <unk> , as you are so obliging . ” Monte Cristo rang ; Baptistin appeared .
The count advanced to meet him .
“ Well ? ” said he in a low voice .
“ The young man is here , ” said the valet de chambre in the same tone .
“ <unk> what room did you take him ? ” “ <unk> the blue drawing-room , according to your excellency ’ s orders . ” “ That ’ s right ; now bring the <unk> and some <unk> . ” Baptistin left the room .
“ Really , ” said the major , “ I am quite ashamed of the trouble I am giving you . ” “ Pray don ’ t mention such a thing , ” said the count .
Baptistin re-entered with glasses , wine , and <unk> .
The count filled one glass , but in the other he only poured a few drops of the <unk> <unk> .
The bottle was covered with spiders ’ <unk> , and all the other signs which indicate the age of wine more truly than do <unk> on a man ’ s face .
The major made a wise choice ; he took the full glass and a <unk> .
The count told Baptistin to leave the plate within reach of his guest , who began by <unk> the <unk> with an expression of great satisfaction , and then <unk> <unk> his <unk> in the wine .
<unk> “ So , sir , you lived at <unk> , did you ?
You were rich , noble , held in great esteem — had all that could render a man happy ? ” “ All , ” said the major , hastily <unk> his <unk> , “ positively all . ” “ And yet there was one thing wanting in order to complete your happiness ? ” “ Only one thing , ” said the Italian .
“ And that one thing , your lost child . ” “ Ah , ” said the major , taking a second <unk> , “ that <unk> of my happiness was indeed wanting . ” The worthy major raised his eyes to heaven and sighed .
“ Let me hear , then , ” said the count , “ who this deeply regretted son was ; for I always understood you were a <unk> . ” “ That was the general opinion , sir , ” said the major , “ and I — — ” “ Yes , ” replied the count , “ and you confirmed the report .
A youthful <unk> , I suppose , which you were anxious to conceal from the world at large ? ” The major recovered himself , and resumed his usual calm manner , at the same time casting his eyes down , either to give himself time to <unk> his countenance , or to assist his imagination , all the while giving an <unk> at the count , the <unk> smile on whose lips still announced the same <unk> curiosity .
“ Yes , ” said the major , “ I did wish this fault to be hidden from every eye . ” “ Not on your own account , surely , ” replied Monte Cristo ; “ for a man is above that sort of thing ? ” “ Oh , no , certainly not on my own account , ” said the major with a smile and a shake of the head .
“ But for the sake of the mother ? ” said the count .
“ Yes , for the mother ’ s sake — his poor mother ! ” cried the major , taking a third <unk> .
“ Take some more wine , my dear Cavalcanti , ” said the count , <unk> out for him a second glass of <unk> ; “ your emotion has quite overcome you . ” “ His poor mother , ” murmured the major , trying to get the <unk> <unk> in operation , so as to <unk> the corner of his eye with a false tear .
“ She belonged to one of the first families in Italy , I think , did she not ? ” “ She was of a noble family of <unk> , count . ” “ And her name was — — ” “ Do you desire to know her name — — ? ” “ Oh , ” said Monte Cristo “ it would be quite <unk> for you to tell me , for I already know it . ” “ The count knows everything , ” said the Italian , bowing .
“ <unk> <unk> , was it not ? ” “ <unk> <unk> ! ” “ A <unk> ? ” “ A <unk> ! ” “ And you married her at last , notwithstanding the opposition of her family ? ” “ Yes , that was the way it ended . ” “ And you have doubtless brought all your papers with you ? ” said Monte Cristo .
“ What papers ? ” “ The <unk> of your marriage with <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> of your child ’ s birth . ” “ The <unk> of my child ’ s birth ? ” “ The <unk> of the birth of Andrea Cavalcanti — of your son ; is not his name Andrea ? ” “ I believe so , ” said the major .
“ What ?
You believe so ? ” “ I dare not positively <unk> it , as he has been lost for so long a time . ” “ Well , then , ” said Monte Cristo “ you have all the documents with you ? ” “ Your excellency , I regret to say that , not knowing it was necessary to come provided with these papers , I neglected to bring them . ” “ That is unfortunate , ” returned Monte Cristo .
“ Were they , then , so necessary ? ” “ They were <unk> . ” The major passed his hand across his brow .
“ Ah , _ <unk> _ , <unk> , were they ? ” “ Certainly they were ; supposing there were to be doubts raised as to the <unk> of your marriage or the <unk> of your child ? ” “ True , ” said the major , “ there might be doubts raised . ” “ In that case your son would be very <unk> situated . ” “ It would be fatal to his interests . ” “ It might cause him to fail in some desirable <unk> alliance . ” “ _ O <unk> ! _ ” “ You must know that in France they are very particular on these points ; it is not sufficient , as in Italy , to go to the priest and say , ‘ We love each other , and want you to marry us . ’ <unk> is a civil affair in France , and in order to marry in an <unk> manner you must have papers which <unk> <unk> your identity . ” “ That is the misfortune !
You see I have not these necessary papers . ” “ Fortunately , I have them , though , ” said Monte Cristo .
“ You ? ” “ Yes . ” “ You have them ? ” “ I have them . ” “ Ah , indeed ? ” said the major , who , seeing the object of his journey <unk> by the absence of the papers , feared also that his forgetfulness might give rise to some difficulty concerning the <unk> francs — “ <unk> , indeed , that is a fortunate circumstance ; yes , that really is lucky , for it never occurred to me to bring them . ” “ I do not at all wonder at it — one cannot think of everything ; but , happily , the Abbé Busoni thought for you . ” “ He is an excellent person . ” “ He is extremely prudent and thoughtful . ” “ He is an admirable man , ” said the major ; “ and he sent them to you ? ” “ Here they are . ” The major clasped his hands in <unk> of admiration .
“ You married <unk> <unk> in the church of <unk> <unk> del <unk> ; here is the priest ’ s <unk> . ” “ Yes indeed , there it is truly , ” said the Italian , looking on with astonishment .
“ And here is Andrea Cavalcanti ’ s <unk> <unk> , given by the curé of <unk> . ” “ All quite correct . ” “ Take these documents , then ; they do not concern me .
You will give them to your son , who will , of course , take great care of them . ” “ I should think so , indeed !
If he were to lose them — — ” “ Well , and if he were to lose them ? ” said Monte Cristo .
“ In that case , ” replied the major , “ it would be necessary to write to the curé for <unk> , and it would be some time before they could be obtained . ” “ It would be a difficult matter to arrange , ” said Monte Cristo .
“ <unk> an <unk> , ” replied the major .
“ I am very glad to see that you understand the value of these papers . ” “ I regard them as <unk> . ” “ Now , ” said Monte Cristo “ as to the mother of the young man — — ” “ As to the mother of the young man — — ” repeated the Italian , with anxiety .
“ As <unk> the <unk> <unk> — — ” “ Really , ” said the major , “ difficulties seem to <unk> upon us ; will she be wanted in any way ? ” “ No , sir , ” replied Monte Cristo ; “ besides , has she not — — ” “ Yes , sir , ” said the major , “ she has — — ” <unk> “ <unk> the last debt of nature ? ” “ Alas , yes , ” returned the Italian .
“ I knew that , ” said Monte Cristo ; “ she has been dead these ten years . ” “ And I am still mourning her loss , ” exclaimed the major , drawing from his pocket a <unk> handkerchief , and <unk> <unk> first the left and then the right eye .
“ What would you have ? ” said Monte Cristo ; “ we are all mortal .
Now , you understand , my dear Monsieur Cavalcanti , that it is useless for you to tell people in France that you have been separated from your son for fifteen years .
<unk> of <unk> , who <unk> children , are not at all in <unk> in this part of the world , and would not be believed .
You sent him for his education to a <unk> in one of the <unk> , and now you wish him to complete his education in the Parisian world .
That is the reason which has induced you to leave <unk> <unk> , where you have lived since the death of your wife .
That will be sufficient . ” “ You think so ? ” “ Certainly . ” “ Very well , then . ” “ If they should hear of the separation — — ” “ Ah , yes ; what could I say ? ” “ That an <unk> <unk> , bought over by the enemies of your family — — ” “ By the <unk> ? ” “ <unk> .
Had stolen away this child , in order that your name might become <unk> . ” “ That is reasonable , since he is an only son . ” “ Well , now that all is arranged , do not let these <unk> awakened <unk> be forgotten .
You have , doubtless , already guessed that I was preparing a surprise for you ? ” “ An agreeable one ? ” asked the Italian .
“ Ah , I see the eye of a father is no more to be deceived than his heart . ” “ <unk> ! ” said the major .
“ <unk> has told you the secret ; or , perhaps , you guessed that he was here . ” “ That who was here ? ” “ Your child — your son — your Andrea ! ” “ I did guess it , ” replied the major with the greatest possible coolness .
“ Then he is here ? ” “ He is , ” said Monte Cristo ; “ when the valet de chambre came in just now , he told me of his arrival . ” “ Ah , very well , very well , ” said the major , <unk> the <unk> of his coat at each exclamation .
“ My dear sir , ” said Monte Cristo , “ I understand your emotion ; you must have time to recover yourself .
I will , in the meantime , go and prepare the young man for this <unk> interview , for I presume that he is not less impatient for it than yourself . ” “ I should quite imagine that to be the case , ” said Cavalcanti .
“ Well , in a quarter of an hour he shall be with you . ” “ You will bring him , then ?
You carry your goodness so far as even to present him to me yourself ? ” “ No ; I do not wish to come between a father and son .
Your interview will be private .
But do not be uneasy ; even if the powerful voice of nature should be silent , you cannot well mistake him ; he will enter by this door .
He is a fine young man , of fair complexion — a little too fair , perhaps — pleasing in manners ; but you will see and judge for yourself . ” “ By the way , ” said the major , “ you know I have only the <unk> francs which the Abbé Busoni sent me ; this sum I have <unk> upon travelling expenses , and — — ” “ And you want money ; that is a matter of course , my dear M. Cavalcanti .
Well , here are <unk> francs on account . ” The major ’ s eyes <unk> <unk> .
“ It is <unk> francs which I now owe you , ” said Monte Cristo .
“ Does your excellency wish for a receipt ? ” said the major , at the same time <unk> the money into the inner pocket of his coat .
“ For what ? ” said the count .
“ I thought you might want it to show the Abbé Busoni . ” “ Well , when you receive the remaining <unk> , you shall give me a receipt in full .
Between honest men such excessive precaution is , I think , quite unnecessary . ” “ Yes , so it is , between perfectly upright people . ” “ One word more , ” said Monte Cristo .
“ Say on . ” “ You will permit me to make one remark ? ” “ Certainly ; pray do so . ” “ Then I should advise you to leave off wearing that style of dress . ” “ Indeed , ” said the major , regarding himself with an air of complete satisfaction .
“ Yes .
It may be worn at <unk> <unk> ; but that costume , however elegant in itself , has long been out of fashion in Paris . ” “ That ’ s unfortunate . ” “ Oh , if you really are attached to your old mode of dress ; you can easily <unk> it when you leave Paris . ” “ But what shall I wear ? ” “ What you find in your <unk> . ” “ In my <unk> ?
I have but one <unk> . ” “ I dare say you have nothing else with you .
What is the use of <unk> one ’ s self with so many things ?
Besides an old soldier always likes to march with as little <unk> as possible . ” “ That is just the case — precisely so . ” “ But you are a man of <unk> and prudence , therefore you sent your <unk> on before you .
It has arrived at the Hôtel des <unk> , Rue de <unk> .
It is there you are to take up your quarters . ” “ Then , in these <unk> — — ” “ I presume you have given orders to your valet de chambre to put in all you are likely to need , — your plain clothes and your uniform .
On grand occasions you must wear your uniform ; that will look very well .
Do not forget your <unk> .
They still laugh at them in France , and yet always wear them , for all that . ” “ Very well , very well , ” said the major , who was in ecstasy at the attention paid him by the count .
“ Now , ” said Monte Cristo , “ that you have <unk> yourself against all painful excitement , prepare yourself , my dear M. Cavalcanti , to meet your lost Andrea . ” <unk> which Monte Cristo bowed , and disappeared behind the <unk> , leaving the major <unk> beyond expression with the delightful reception which he had received at the hands of the count .
Chapter <unk> .
Andrea Cavalcanti The Count of Monte Cristo entered the adjoining room , which Baptistin had designated as the drawing-room , and found there a young man , of graceful <unk> and elegant appearance , who had arrived in a cab about half an hour previously .
Baptistin had not found any difficulty in <unk> the person who presented himself at the door for <unk> .
He was certainly the tall young man with light hair , red beard , black eyes , and brilliant complexion , whom his master had so particularly described to him .
When the count entered the room the young man was <unk> stretched on a sofa , <unk> his <unk> with the <unk> cane which he held in his hand .
On perceiving the count he rose quickly .
“ The Count of Monte Cristo , I believe ? ” said he .
“ Yes , sir , and I think I have the honor of addressing Count Andrea Cavalcanti ? ” “ Count Andrea Cavalcanti , ” repeated the young man , <unk> his words with a bow .
“ You are charged with a letter of introduction addressed to me , are you not ? ” said the count .
“ I did not mention that , because the signature seemed to me so strange . ” “ The letter signed ‘ Sinbad the <unk> , ’ is it not ? ” “ Exactly so .
Now , as I have never known any Sinbad , with the exception of the one celebrated in the _ <unk> and One <unk> _ — — ” “ Well , it is one of his <unk> , and a great friend of mine ; he is a very rich Englishman , eccentric almost to <unk> , and his real name is Lord Wilmore . ” “ Ah , indeed ?
Then that <unk> everything that is extraordinary , ” said Andrea .
“ He is , then , the same Englishman whom I met — at — <unk> — yes , indeed .
Well , monsieur , I am at your service . ” “ If what you say be true , ” replied the count , smiling , “ perhaps you will be kind enough to give me some account of yourself and your family ? ” “ Certainly , I will do so , ” said the young man , with a <unk> which gave proof of his ready <unk> .
“ I am ( as you have said ) the Count Andrea Cavalcanti , son of <unk> <unk> Cavalcanti , a <unk> of the Cavalcanti whose names are <unk> in the golden book at <unk> .
Our family , although still rich ( for my father ’ s income <unk> to half a million ) , has experienced many misfortunes , and I myself was , at the age of five years , taken away by the <unk> of my <unk> , so that for fifteen years I have not seen the author of my existence .
Since I have arrived at years of <unk> and become my own master , I have been constantly seeking him , but all in vain .
At length I received this letter from your friend , which states that my father is in Paris , and <unk> me to address myself to you for information respecting him . ” “ Really , all you have related to me is exceedingly interesting , ” said Monte Cristo , observing the young man with a gloomy satisfaction ; “ and you have done well to <unk> in everything to the wishes of my friend Sinbad ; for your father is indeed here , and is seeking you . ” The count from the moment of first entering the drawing-room , had not once lost sight of the expression of the young man ’ s countenance ; he had admired the assurance of his look and the <unk> of his voice ; but at these words , so natural in themselves , “ Your father is indeed here , and is seeking you , ” young Andrea started , and exclaimed , “ My father ?
Is my father here ? ” “ Most undoubtedly , ” replied Monte Cristo ; “ your father , <unk> <unk> Cavalcanti . ” The expression of terror which , for the moment , had <unk> the features of the young man , had now disappeared .
“ Ah , yes , that is the name , certainly .
<unk> <unk> Cavalcanti .
And you really mean to say ; monsieur , that my dear father is here ? ” “ Yes , sir ; and I can even add that I have only just left his company .
The history which he related to me of his lost son touched me to the quick ; indeed , his <unk> , hopes , and fears on that subject might furnish material for a most touching and <unk> <unk> .
At length , he one day received a letter , <unk> that the <unk> of his son now offered to restore him , or at least to give notice where he might be found , on condition of receiving a large sum of money , by way of <unk> .
Your father did not hesitate an instant , and the sum was sent to the <unk> of <unk> , with a passport signed for Italy .
You were in the south of France , I think ? ” “ Yes , ” replied Andrea , with an embarrassed air , “ I was in the south of France . ” “ A carriage was to await you at <unk> ? ” “ <unk> so ; and it conveyed me from <unk> to <unk> , from <unk> to <unk> , from <unk> to <unk> , from <unk> to <unk> , and from <unk> to Paris . ” <unk> “ Indeed ?
Then your father ought to have met with you on the road , for it is exactly the same <unk> which he himself took , and that is how we have been able to trace your journey to this place . ” “ But , ” said Andrea , “ if my father had met me , I doubt if he would have recognized me ; I must be somewhat altered since he last saw me . ” “ Oh , the voice of nature , ” said Monte Cristo .
“ True , ” interrupted the young man , “ I had not looked upon it in that light . ” “ Now , ” replied Monte Cristo “ there is only one source of uneasiness left in your father ’ s mind , which is this — he is anxious to know how you have been employed during your long absence from him , how you have been treated by your <unk> , and if they have conducted themselves towards you with all the <unk> due to your rank .
Finally , he is anxious to see if you have been fortunate enough to escape the bad moral influence to which you have been exposed , and which is infinitely more to be dreaded than any physical suffering ; he wishes to discover if the fine <unk> with which nature had <unk> you have been <unk> by want of <unk> ; and , in short , whether you consider yourself capable of <unk> and <unk> in the world the high position to which your rank <unk> you . ” “ Sir ! ” exclaimed the young man , quite <unk> , “ I hope no false report — — ” “ As for myself , I first heard you spoken of by my friend Wilmore , the <unk> .
I believe he found you in some unpleasant position , but do not know of what nature , for I did not ask , not being <unk> .
Your misfortunes engaged his <unk> , so you see you must have been interesting .
He told me that he was anxious to restore you to the position which you had lost , and that he would seek your father until he found him .
He did seek , and has found him , apparently , since he is here now ; and , finally , my friend <unk> me of your coming , and gave me a few other instructions relative to your future fortune .
I am quite aware that my friend Wilmore is peculiar , but he is sincere , and as rich as a gold mine , consequently , he may indulge his <unk> without any fear of their <unk> him , and I have promised to <unk> to his instructions .
Now , sir , pray do not be offended at the question I am about to put to you , as it comes in the way of my duty as your patron .
I would wish to know if the misfortunes which have happened to you — misfortunes entirely beyond your <unk> , and which in no degree <unk> my regard for you — I would wish to know if they have not , in some measure , <unk> to render you a stranger to the world in which your fortune and your name <unk> you to make a <unk> figure ? ” “ Sir , ” returned the young man , with a <unk> of manner , “ make your mind easy on this <unk> .
Those who took me from my father , and who always intended , sooner or later , to sell me again to my original <unk> , as they have now done , calculated that , in order to make the most of their <unk> , it would be <unk> to leave me in possession of all my personal and <unk> worth , and even to increase the value , if possible .
I have , therefore , received a very good education , and have been treated by these <unk> very much as the <unk> were treated in <unk> <unk> , whose masters made them <unk> , <unk> , and philosophers , in order that they might fetch a higher price in the Roman <unk> . ” Monte Cristo smiled with satisfaction ; it appeared as if he had not expected so much from M. Andrea Cavalcanti .
“ Besides , ” continued the young man , “ if there did appear some defect in education , or offence against the established forms of <unk> , I suppose it would be <unk> , in consideration of the misfortunes which accompanied my birth , and followed me through my youth . ” “ Well , ” said Monte Cristo in an indifferent tone , “ you will do as you please , count , for you are the master of your own actions , and are the person most concerned in the matter , but if I were you , I would not <unk> a word of these adventures .
Your history is quite a romance , and the world , which <unk> in <unk> in yellow <unk> , strangely <unk> those which are bound in living <unk> , even though they be gilded like yourself .
This is the kind of difficulty which I wished to <unk> to you , my dear count .
You would hardly have <unk> your touching history before it would go forth to the world , and be <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
You would be no longer a lost child found , but you would be looked upon as an <unk> , who had sprung up like a <unk> in the night .
You might excite a little curiosity , but it is not everyone who likes to be made the centre of observation and the subject of unpleasant remark . ” “ I agree with you , monsieur , ” said the young man , turning pale , and , in spite of himself , trembling beneath the <unk> look of his companion , “ such <unk> would be extremely unpleasant . ” “ Nevertheless , you must not <unk> the evil , ” said Monte Cristo , “ for by endeavoring to avoid one fault you will fall into another .
You must resolve upon one simple and single line of conduct , and for a man of your intelligence , this plan is as easy as it is necessary ; you must form honorable <unk> , and by that means <unk> the <unk> which may attach to the obscurity of your former life . ” Andrea <unk> changed countenance .
“ I would offer myself as your <unk> and friendly <unk> , ” said Monte Cristo , “ did I not possess a moral distrust of my best friends , and a sort of inclination to lead others to doubt them too ; therefore , in <unk> from this rule , I should ( as the <unk> say ) be playing a part quite out of my line , and should , therefore , run the risk of being <unk> , which would be an act of folly . ” “ However , your excellency , ” said Andrea , “ in consideration of Lord Wilmore , by whom I was recommended to you — — ” “ Yes , certainly , ” interrupted Monte Cristo ; “ but Lord Wilmore did not <unk> to inform me , my dear M. Andrea , that the season of your youth was rather a stormy one .
Ah , ” said the count , watching Andrea ’ s countenance , “ I do not demand any confession from you ; it is precisely to avoid that necessity that your father was sent for from <unk> .
You shall soon see him .
He is a little stiff and <unk> in his manner , and he is <unk> by his uniform ; but when it becomes known that he has been for eighteen years in the <unk> service , all that will be <unk> .
We are not generally very severe with the <unk> .
In short , you will find your father a very <unk> person , I assure you . ” “ Ah , sir , you have given me confidence ; it is so long since we were separated , that I have not the least remembrance of him , and , besides , you know that in the eyes of the world a large fortune <unk> all <unk> . ” “ He is a <unk> — his income is <unk> francs . ” “ Then , ” said the young man , with anxiety , “ I shall be sure to be placed in an agreeable position . ” “ One of the most agreeable possible , my dear sir ; he will allow you an income of <unk> livres per <unk> during the whole time of your stay in Paris . ” “ Then in that case I shall always choose to remain there . ” “ You cannot <unk> circumstances , my dear sir ; ‘ man <unk> , and God <unk> . ’ ” Andrea sighed .
“ But , ” said he , “ so long as I do remain in Paris , and nothing forces me to quit it , do you mean to tell me that I may rely on receiving the sum you just now mentioned to me ? ” “ You may . ” “ Shall I receive it from my father ? ” asked Andrea , with some uneasiness .
“ Yes , you will receive it from your father <unk> , but Lord Wilmore will be the security for the money .
He has , at the request of your father , opened an account of <unk> francs a month at M. Danglars ’ , which is one of the <unk> banks in Paris . ” “ And does my father mean to remain long in Paris ? ” asked Andrea .
“ Only a few days , ” replied Monte Cristo .
“ His service does not allow him to absent himself more than two or three weeks together . ” “ Ah , my dear father ! ” exclaimed Andrea , evidently <unk> with the idea of his <unk> departure .
“ <unk> , ” said Monte Cristo <unk> to mistake his meaning — “ therefore I will not , for another instant , <unk> the pleasure of your meeting .
Are you prepared to embrace your worthy father ? ” “ I hope you do not doubt it . ” <unk> “ Go , then , into the drawing-room , my young friend , where you will find your father awaiting you . ” Andrea made a low bow to the count , and entered the adjoining room .
Monte Cristo watched him till he disappeared , and then touched a spring in a <unk> made to look like a picture , which , in <unk> partly from the frame , discovered to view a small opening , so <unk> contrived that it revealed all that was passing in the drawing-room now occupied by Cavalcanti and Andrea .
The young man closed the door behind him , and advanced towards the major , who had risen when he heard steps approaching him .
“ Ah , my dear father ! ” said Andrea in a loud voice , in order that the count might hear him in the next room , “ is it really you ? ” “ How do you do , my dear son ? ” said the major gravely .
“ After so many years of painful separation , ” said Andrea , in the same tone of voice , and glancing towards the door , “ what a happiness it is to meet again ! ” “ Indeed it is , after so long a separation . ” “ Will you not embrace me , sir ? ” said Andrea .
<unk> “ If you wish it , my son , ” said the major ; and the two men embraced each other after the fashion of <unk> on the stage ; that is to say , each rested his head on the other ’ s shoulder .
“ Then we are once more <unk> ? ” said Andrea .
“ Once more , ” replied the major .
“ Never more to be separated ? ” “ Why , as to that — I think , my dear son , you must be by this time so accustomed to France as to look upon it almost as a second country . ” “ The fact is , ” said the young man , “ that I should be exceedingly grieved to leave it . ” “ As for me , you must know I cannot possibly live out of <unk> ; therefore I shall return to Italy as soon as I can . ” “ But before you leave France , my dear father , I hope you will put me in possession of the documents which will be necessary to prove my descent . ” “ Certainly ; I am come <unk> on that account ; it has cost me much trouble to find you , but I had resolved on giving them into your hands , and if I had to <unk> my search , it would occupy all the few remaining years of my life . ” “ Where are these papers , then ? ” “ Here they are . ” Andrea seized the <unk> of his father ’ s marriage and his own <unk> <unk> , and after having opened them with all the eagerness which might be expected under the circumstances , he read them with a <unk> which proved that he was accustomed to similar documents , and with an expression which plainly <unk> an unusual interest in the contents .
When he had <unk> the documents , an <unk> expression of pleasure lighted up his countenance , and looking at the major with a most peculiar smile , he said , in very excellent <unk> : “ Then there is no longer any such thing , in Italy as being condemned to the galleys ? ” The major drew himself up to his full height .
“ Why ? — what do you mean by that question ? ” “ I mean that if there were , it would be impossible to draw up with <unk> two such deeds as these .
In France , my dear sir , half such a piece of <unk> as that would cause you to be quickly <unk> to Toulon for five years , for change of air . ” “ Will you be good enough to explain your meaning ? ” said the major , endeavoring as much as possible to assume an air of the greatest majesty .
“ My dear M. Cavalcanti , ” said Andrea , taking the major by the arm in a <unk> manner , “ how much are you paid for being my father ? ” The major was about to speak , when Andrea continued , in a low voice : “ <unk> , I am going to set you an example of confidence , they give me <unk> francs a year to be your son ; consequently , you can understand that it is not at all likely I shall ever deny my <unk> . ” The major looked anxiously around him .
“ Make yourself easy , we are quite alone , ” said Andrea ; “ besides , we are conversing in Italian . ” “ Well , then , ” replied the major , “ they paid me <unk> francs down . ” “ Monsieur Cavalcanti , ” said Andrea , “ do you believe in <unk> <unk> ? ” “ I used not to do so , but I really feel now almost obliged to have faith in them . ” “ You have , then , been induced to alter your opinion ; you have had some proofs of their truth ? ” The major drew from his pocket a handful of gold .
“ Most <unk> proofs , ” said he , “ as you may perceive . ” “ You think , then , that I may rely on the count ’ s promises ? ” “ Certainly I do . ” “ You are sure he will keep his word with me ? ” “ To the letter , but at the same time , remember , we must continue to play our <unk> parts .
I , as a tender father — — ” “ And I as a <unk> son , as they choose that I shall be descended from you . ” “ <unk> do you mean by they ? ” “ _ Ma foi _ , I can hardly tell , but I was <unk> to those who wrote the letter ; you received one , did you not ? ” “ Yes . ” “ From whom ? ” “ From a certain Abbé Busoni . ” “ Have you any knowledge of him ? ” “ No , I have never seen him . ” “ What did he say in the letter ? ” “ You will promise not to betray me ? ” “ <unk> assured of that ; you well know that our interests are the same . ” “ Then read for yourself ; ” and the major gave a letter into the young man ’ s hand .
Andrea read in a low voice : “ ‘ You are poor ; a miserable old age <unk> you .
Would you like to become rich , or at least independent ?
<unk> out immediately for Paris , and demand of the Count of Monte Cristo , <unk> des Champs-Élysées , No .
30 , the son whom you had by the <unk> <unk> , and who was taken from you at five years of age .
This son is named Andrea Cavalcanti .
In order that you may not doubt the kind intention of the <unk> of this letter , you will find <unk> an order for <unk> francs , <unk> in <unk> , at Signor <unk> ’ s ; also a letter of introduction to the Count of Monte Cristo , on whom I give you a <unk> of <unk> francs .
Remember to go to the count on the <unk> May at seven o ’ clock in the evening .
“ ( <unk> ) ‘ Abbé Busoni . ’ ” “ It is the same . ” “ What do you mean ? ” said the major .
“ I was going to say that I received a letter almost to the same effect . ” “ You ? ” “ Yes . ” “ From the Abbé Busoni ? ” “ No . ” “ From whom , then ? ” “ From an Englishman , called Lord Wilmore , who takes the name of Sinbad the <unk> . ” “ And of whom you have no more knowledge than I of the Abbé Busoni ? ” “ You are mistaken ; there I am <unk> of you . ” “ You have seen him , then ? ” “ Yes , once . ” “ Where ? ” “ Ah , that is just what I cannot tell you ; if I did , I should make you as wise as myself , which it is not my intention to do . ” “ And what did the letter contain ? ” “ <unk> it . ” “ ‘ You are poor , and your future prospects are dark and gloomy .
Do you wish for a name ?
should you like to be rich , and your own master ? ’ ” “ _ <unk> ! _ ” said the young man ; “ was it possible there could be two <unk> to such a question ? ” “ ‘ Take the <unk> which you will find waiting at the <unk> de <unk> , as you enter <unk> ; pass through <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
Go to the Count of Monte Cristo , <unk> des Champs-Élysées , on the <unk> of May , at seven o ’ clock in the evening , and demand of him your father .
You are the son of the <unk> Cavalcanti and the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The marquis will give you some papers which will <unk> this fact , and <unk> you to appear under that name in the Parisian world .
As to your rank , an <unk> income of <unk> livres will <unk> you to support it admirably .
I <unk> a <unk> for <unk> livres , <unk> on M. <unk> , banker at <unk> , and also a letter of introduction to the Count of Monte Cristo , whom I have directed to supply all your wants .
“ ‘ Sinbad the <unk> . ’ ” “ <unk> , ” said the major ; “ very good .
You have seen the count , you say ? ” “ I have only just left him . ” “ And has he <unk> to all that the letter <unk> ? ” “ He has . ” “ Do you understand it ? ” “ Not in the least . ” “ There is a <unk> somewhere . ” “ At all events , it is neither you nor I. ” “ Certainly not . ” “ Well , then — — ” “ Why , it does not much concern us , do you think it does ? ” “ No ; I agree with you there .
We must play the game to the end , and consent to be <unk> . ” “ Ah , you shall see ; I promise you I will <unk> my part to admiration . ” “ I never once doubted your doing so . ” Monte Cristo chose this moment for <unk> the drawing-room .
On hearing the sound of his footsteps , the two men threw themselves in each other ’ s arms , and while they were in the midst of this embrace , the count entered .
“ Well , marquis , ” said Monte Cristo , “ you appear to be in no way disappointed in the son whom your good fortune has restored to you . ” “ Ah , your excellency , I am overwhelmed with delight . ” “ And what are your feelings ? ” said Monte Cristo , turning to the young man .
“ As for me , my heart is <unk> with happiness . ” “ <unk> father , happy son ! ” said the count .
“ There is only one thing which <unk> me , ” observed the major , “ and that is the necessity for my leaving Paris so soon . ” “ Ah , my dear M. Cavalcanti , I trust you will not leave before I have had the honor of presenting you to some of my friends . ” “ I am at your service , sir , ” replied the major .
“ Now , sir , ” said Monte Cristo , addressing Andrea , “ make your confession . ” “ To whom ? ” “ Tell M. Cavalcanti something of the state of your <unk> . ” “ _ Ma foi ! _ monsieur , you have touched upon a tender <unk> . ” “ Do you hear what he says , major ? ” “ Certainly I do . ” “ But do you understand ? ” “ I do . ” “ Your son says he requires money . ” “ Well , what would you have me do ? ” said the major .
“ You should furnish him with some of course , ” replied Monte Cristo .
“ I ? ” “ Yes , you , ” said the count , at the same time advancing towards Andrea , and <unk> a packet of bank-notes into the young man ’ s hand .
“ What is this ? ” “ It is from your father . ” “ From my father ? ” “ Yes ; did you not tell him just now that you wanted money ?
Well , then , he <unk> me to give you this . ” “ Am I to consider this as part of my income on account ? ” “ No , it is for the first expenses of your <unk> in Paris . ” “ Ah , how good my dear father is ! ” “ Silence , ” said Monte Cristo ; “ he does not wish you to know that it comes from him . ” “ I fully <unk> his delicacy , ” said Andrea , <unk> the notes hastily into his pocket .
“ And now , gentlemen , I wish you <unk> , ” said Monte Cristo .
“ And when shall we have the honor of seeing you again , your excellency ? ” asked Cavalcanti .
“ Ah , ” said Andrea , “ when may we hope for that pleasure ? ” “ On Saturday , if you will — Yes . — Let me see — Saturday — I am to dine at my country house , at Auteuil , on that day , Rue de la <unk> , No .
<unk> .
<unk> persons are invited , and among others , M. Danglars , your banker .
I will introduce you to him , for it will be necessary he should know you , as he is to pay your money . ” “ <unk> dress ? ” said the major , half aloud .
“ Oh , yes , certainly , ” said the count ; “ uniform , cross , <unk> . ” “ And how shall I be dressed ? ” demanded Andrea .
<unk> “ Oh , very simply ; black trousers , <unk> leather boots , white waistcoat , either a black or blue coat , and a long cravat .
Go to <unk> or <unk> for your clothes .
Baptistin will tell you where , if you do not know their address .
The less <unk> there is in your <unk> , the better will be the effect , as you are a rich man .
If you mean to buy any horses , get them of <unk> , and if you purchase a <unk> , go to <unk> for it . ” “ At what hour shall we come ? ” asked the young man .
“ About half-past six . ” “ We will be with you at that time , ” said the major .
The two Cavalcanti bowed to the count , and left the house .
Monte Cristo went to the window , and saw them crossing the street , arm in arm .
“ There go two <unk> ; ” said he , “ it is a pity they are not really related ! ” Then , after an instant of gloomy reflection , “ Come , I will go to see the <unk> , ” said he ; “ I think that disgust is even more <unk> than hatred . ” <unk> Chapter <unk> .
In the <unk> <unk> Our <unk> must now allow us to <unk> them again to the enclosure <unk> M. de Villefort ’ s house , and , behind the gate , half <unk> from view by the large <unk> , which on all sides spread their <unk> branches , we shall find some people of our acquaintance .
This time Maximilian was the first to arrive .
He was intently watching for a shadow to appear among the trees , and awaiting with anxiety the sound of a light step on the <unk> walk .
At length , the <unk> sound was heard , and instead of one figure , as he had expected , he perceived that two were approaching him .
The delay had been <unk> by a visit from Madame Danglars and Eugénie , which had been prolonged beyond the time at which Valentine was expected .
That she might not appear to fail in her promise to Maximilian , she proposed to Mademoiselle Danglars that they should take a walk in the garden , being anxious to show that the delay , which was doubtless a cause of <unk> to him , was not <unk> by any neglect on her part .
The young man , with the <unk> <unk> of a lover , quickly understood the circumstances in which she was <unk> placed , and he was <unk> .
Besides , although she avoided coming within speaking distance , Valentine arranged so that Maximilian could see her pass and <unk> , and each time she went by , she managed , <unk> by her companion , to cast an expressive look at the young man , which seemed to say , “ Have patience !
You see it is not my fault . ” And Maximilian was patient , and employed himself in <unk> <unk> the two girls , — one fair , with soft <unk> eyes , a figure <unk> bending like a weeping <unk> ; the other a <unk> , with a fierce and haughty expression , and as straight as a <unk> .
It is unnecessary to state that , in the eyes of the young man , Valentine did not suffer by the contrast .
In about half an hour the girls went away , and Maximilian understood that Mademoiselle Danglars ’ visit had at last come to an end .
In a few minutes Valentine re-entered the garden alone .
For fear that anyone should be observing her return , she walked slowly ; and instead of immediately <unk> her steps towards the gate , she seated herself on a bench , and , carefully casting her eyes around , to convince herself that she was not watched , she presently arose , and proceeded quickly to join Maximilian .
“ <unk> , Valentine , ” said a <unk> voice .
“ <unk> , Maximilian ; I know I have kept you waiting , but you saw the cause of my delay . ” “ Yes , I recognized Mademoiselle Danglars .
I was not aware that you were so intimate with her . ” “ Who told you we were intimate , Maximilian ? ” “ No one , but you appeared to be so .
From the manner in which you walked and talked together , one would have thought you were two <unk> telling your secrets to each other . ” “ We were having a <unk> conversation , ” returned Valentine ; “ she was <unk> to me her <unk> to the marriage with M. de Morcerf ; and I , on the other hand , was <unk> to her how wretched it made me to think of marrying M. d ’ Épinay . ” “ Dear Valentine ! ” “ That will account to you for the <unk> manner which you observed between me and Eugénie , as in speaking of the man whom I could not love , my thoughts <unk> <unk> to him on whom my affections were fixed . ” “ Ah , how good you are to say so , Valentine !
You possess a quality which can never belong to Mademoiselle Danglars .
It is that <unk> charm which is to a woman what perfume is to the flower and <unk> to the fruit , for the beauty of either is not the only quality we seek . ” “ It is your love which makes you look upon everything in that light . ” “ No , Valentine , I assure you such is not the case .
I was observing you both when you were walking in the garden , and , on my honor , without at all wishing to <unk> the beauty of Mademoiselle Danglars , I cannot understand how any man can really love her . ” “ The fact is , Maximilian , that I was there , and my presence had the effect of <unk> you unjust in your comparison . ” “ No ; but tell me — it is a question of simple curiosity , and which was suggested by certain ideas passing in my mind relative to Mademoiselle Danglars — — ” “ I dare say it is something <unk> which you are going to say .
It only <unk> how little indulgence we may expect from your sex , ” interrupted Valentine .
“ You cannot , at least , deny that you are very harsh judges of each other . ” “ If we are so , it is because we generally judge under the influence of excitement .
But return to your question . ” <unk> “ Does Mademoiselle Danglars object to this marriage with M. de Morcerf on account of loving another ? ” “ I told you I was not on terms of strict intimacy with Eugénie . ” “ Yes , but girls tell each other secrets without being particularly intimate ; own , now , that you did question her on the subject .
Ah , I see you are smiling . ” “ If you are already aware of the conversation that passed , the wooden <unk> which <unk> between us and you has proved but a slight security . ” “ Come , what did she say ? ” “ She told me that she loved no one , ” said Valentine ; “ that she <unk> the idea of being married ; that she would infinitely prefer leading an independent and <unk> life ; and that she almost wished her father might lose his fortune , that she might become an artist , like her friend , Mademoiselle Louise d ’ <unk> . ” “ Ah , you see — — ” “ Well , what does that prove ? ” asked Valentine .
“ Nothing , ” replied Maximilian .
“ Then why did you smile ? ” “ Why , you know very well that you are <unk> on yourself , Valentine . ” “ Do you want me to go away ? ” “ Ah , no , no .
But do not let us lose time ; you are the subject on which I wish to speak . ” “ True , we must be quick , for we have scarcely ten minutes more to pass together . ” “ _ Ma foi ! _ ” said Maximilian , in <unk> .
“ Yes , you are right ; I am but a poor friend to you .
What a life I cause you to lead , poor Maximilian , you who are formed for happiness !
I bitterly reproach myself , I assure you . ” “ Well , what does it signify , Valentine , so long as I am satisfied , and feel that even this long and painful suspense is <unk> <unk> by five minutes of your society , or two words from your lips ?
And I have also a deep conviction that heaven would not have created two hearts , <unk> as ours do , and almost <unk> brought us together , to separate us at last . ” “ Those are kind and <unk> words .
You must hope for us both , Maximilian ; that will make me at least partly happy . ” “ But why must you leave me so soon ? ” “ I do not know particulars .
I can only tell you that Madame de Villefort sent to request my presence , as she had a communication to make on which a part of my fortune depended .
Let them take my fortune , I am already too rich ; and , perhaps , when they have taken it , they will leave me in peace and <unk> .
You would love me as much if I were poor , would you not , Maximilian ? ” “ Oh , I shall always love you .
What should I care for either riches or poverty , if my Valentine was near me , and I felt certain that no one could <unk> me of her ?
But do you not fear that this communication may relate to your marriage ? ” “ I do not think that is the case . ” “ However it may be , Valentine , you must not be alarmed .
I assure you that , as long as I live , I shall never love anyone else ! ” “ Do you think to <unk> me when you say that , Maximilian ? ” “ Pardon me , you are right .
I am a brute .
But I was going to tell you that I met M. de Morcerf the other day . ” “ Well ? ” “ Monsieur Franz is his friend , you know . ” “ What then ? ” “ Monsieur de Morcerf has received a letter from Franz , <unk> his immediate return . ” Valentine turned pale , and leaned her hand against the gate .
“ Ah heavens , if it were that !
But no , the communication would not come through Madame de Villefort . ” “ Why not ? ” “ Because — I scarcely know why — but it has appeared as if Madame de Villefort <unk> <unk> to the marriage , although she did not choose <unk> to oppose it . ” “ Is it so ?
Then I feel as if I could adore Madame de Villefort . ” “ Do not be in such a hurry to do that , ” said Valentine , with a sad smile .
“ If she objects to your marrying M. d ’ Épinay , she would be all the more likely to listen to any other <unk> . ” “ No , Maximilian , it is not <unk> to which Madame de Villefort objects , it is marriage itself . ” “ <unk> ?
If she <unk> that so much , why did she ever marry herself ? ” “ You do not understand me , Maximilian .
About a year ago , I talked of <unk> to a convent .
Madame de Villefort , in spite of all the remarks which she considered it her duty to make , <unk> approved of the <unk> , my father <unk> to it at her <unk> , and it was only on account of my poor grandfather that I finally abandoned the project .
You can form no idea of the expression of that old man ’ s eye when he looks at me , the only person in the world whom he loves , and , I had almost said , by whom he is beloved in return .
When he learned my resolution , I shall never forget the <unk> look which he cast on me , and the tears of utter despair which <unk> each other down his <unk> cheeks .
Ah , Maximilian , I experienced , at that moment , such remorse for my intention , that , throwing myself at his feet , I exclaimed , — ‘ <unk> me , pray forgive me , my dear grandfather ; they may do what they will with me , I will never leave you . ’ When I had ceased speaking , he <unk> raised his eyes to heaven , but without uttering a word .
Ah , Maximilian , I may have much to suffer , but I feel as if my grandfather ’ s look at that moment would more than <unk> for all . ” “ Dear Valentine , you are a perfect angel , and I am sure I do not know what I — <unk> right and left among the <unk> — can have done to merit your being revealed to me , unless , indeed , Heaven took into consideration the fact that the <unk> of my sword were <unk> .
But tell me what interest Madame de Villefort can have in your remaining <unk> ? ” “ Did I not tell you just now that I was rich , Maximilian — too rich ?
I possess nearly <unk> livres in right of my mother ; my grandfather and my grandmother , the Marquis and <unk> de Saint-Méran , will leave me as much , and M. Noirtier evidently <unk> making me his heir .
My brother Edward , who <unk> nothing from his mother , will , therefore , be poor in comparison with me .
Now , if I had taken the veil , all this fortune would have descended to my father , and , in <unk> , to his son . ” “ Ah , how strange it seems that such a young and beautiful woman should be so <unk> . ” “ It is not for herself that she is so , but for her son , and what you regard as a vice becomes almost a virtue when looked at in the light of <unk> love . ” “ But could you not <unk> matters , and give up a portion of your fortune to her son ? ” “ How could I make such a <unk> , especially to a woman who always <unk> to be so entirely <unk> ? ” “ Valentine , I have always regarded our love in the light of something sacred ; consequently , I have covered it with the veil of respect , and hid it in the <unk> <unk> of my soul .
No human being , not even my sister , is aware of its existence .
Valentine , will you permit me to make a <unk> of a friend and reveal to him the love I bear you ? ” Valentine started .
“ A friend , Maximilian ; and who is this friend ?
I tremble to give my permission . ” “ Listen , Valentine .
Have you never experienced for anyone that sudden and irresistible sympathy which made you feel as if the object of it had been your old and familiar friend , though , in reality , it was the first time you had ever met ?
Nay , further , have you never endeavored to recall the time , place , and circumstances of your former intercourse , and <unk> in this attempt , have almost believed that your spirits must have held <unk> with each other in some state of being <unk> to the present , and that you are only now occupied in a <unk> of the past ? ” “ Yes . ” “ Well , that is precisely the feeling which I experienced when I first saw that extraordinary man . ” “ <unk> , did you say ? ” “ Yes . ” “ You have known him for some time , then ? ” “ <unk> longer than eight or ten days . ” “ And do you call a man your friend whom you have only known for eight or ten days ?
Ah , Maximilian , I had hoped you set a higher value on the title of friend . ” “ Your <unk> is most powerful , Valentine , but say what you will , I can never <unk> the sentiment which has instinctively taken possession of my mind .
I feel as if it were <unk> that this man should be associated with all the good which the future may have in <unk> for me , and sometimes it really seems as if his eye was able to see what was to come , and his hand <unk> with the power of <unk> events according to his own will . ” “ He must be a <unk> , then , ” said Valentine , smiling .
“ Indeed , ” said Maximilian , “ I have often been almost tempted to <unk> to him the gift of <unk> ; at all events , he has a wonderful power of <unk> any future good . ” “ Ah , ” said Valentine in a mournful tone , “ do let me see this man , Maximilian ; he may tell me whether I shall ever be loved sufficiently to make <unk> for all I have suffered . ” “ My poor girl , you know him already . ” “ I know him ? ” “ Yes ; it was he who saved the life of your <unk> and her son . ” “ The Count of Monte Cristo ? ” “ The same . ” “ Ah , ” cried Valentine , “ he is too much the friend of Madame de Villefort ever to be mine . ” “ The friend of Madame de Villefort !
It cannot be ; surely , Valentine , you are mistaken ? ” “ No , indeed , I am not ; for I assure you , his power over our household is almost <unk> .
<unk> by my <unk> , who <unk> him as the <unk> of human wisdom ; admired by my father , who says he has never before heard such sublime ideas so <unk> expressed ; <unk> by Edward , who , notwithstanding his fear of the count ’ s large black eyes , runs to meet him the moment he arrives , and opens his hand , in which he is sure to find some delightful present , — M.
de Monte Cristo appears to <unk> a mysterious and almost <unk> influence over all the members of our family . ” “ If such be the case , my dear Valentine , you must yourself have felt , or at all events will soon feel , the effects of his presence .
He <unk> Albert de Morcerf in Italy — it is to <unk> him from the hands of the <unk> ; he <unk> himself to Madame Danglars — it is that he may give her a royal present ; your <unk> and her son pass before his door — it is that his <unk> may save them from destruction .
This man evidently possesses the power of <unk> events , both as <unk> men and things .
I never saw more simple <unk> united to greater <unk> .
His smile is so sweet when he <unk> me , that I forget it ever can be bitter to others .
Ah , Valentine , tell me , if he ever looked on you with one of those sweet smiles ?
if so , depend on it , you will be happy . ” “ <unk> ? ” said the young girl , “ he never even glances at me ; on the contrary , if I <unk> cross his path , he appears rather to avoid me .
Ah , he is not generous , neither does he possess that <unk> <unk> which you <unk> to him , for if he did , he would have perceived that I was unhappy ; and if he had been generous , seeing me sad and solitary , he would have used his influence to my advantage , and since , as you say , he resembles the sun , he would have <unk> my heart with one of his <unk> rays .
You say he loves you , Maximilian ; how do you know that he does ?
All would pay <unk> to an officer like you , with a fierce <unk> and a long <unk> , but they think they may crush a poor weeping girl with <unk> . ” “ Ah , Valentine , I assure you you are mistaken . ” “ If it were otherwise — if he treated me <unk> — that is to say , like a man who wishes , by some means or other , to obtain a <unk> in the house , so that he may <unk> gain the power of <unk> to its <unk> — he would , if it had been but once , have <unk> me with the smile which you <unk> so loudly ; but no , he saw that I was unhappy , he understood that I could be of no use to him , and therefore paid no attention to me whatever .
Who knows but that , in order to please Madame de Villefort and my father , he may not <unk> me by every means in his power ?
It is not just that he should <unk> me so , without any reason .
Ah , forgive me , ” said Valentine , perceiving the effect which her words were <unk> on Maximilian : “ I have done wrong , for I have given utterance to thoughts concerning that man which I did not even know existed in my heart .
I do not deny the influence of which you speak , or that I have not myself experienced it , but with me it has been <unk> of evil rather than good . ” “ Well , Valentine , ” said Morrel with a sigh , “ we will not <unk> the matter further .
I will not make a <unk> of him . ” “ Alas ! ” said Valentine , “ I see that I have given you pain .
I can only say how sincerely I ask pardon for having grieved you .
But , indeed , I am not <unk> beyond the power of conviction .
Tell me what this Count of Monte Cristo has done for you . ” <unk> “ I own that your question <unk> me , Valentine , for I cannot say that the count has rendered me any <unk> service .
Still , as I have already told you , I have an <unk> affection for him , the source of which I cannot explain to you .
Has the sun done anything for me ?
No ; he <unk> me with his rays , and it is by his light that I see you — nothing more .
Has such and such a perfume done anything for me ?
No ; its odor <unk> one of my senses — that is all I can say when I am asked why I praise it .
My friendship for him is as strange and <unk> as his for me .
A secret voice seems to whisper to me that there must be something more than chance in this unexpected <unk> of friendship .
In his most simple actions , as well as in his most secret thoughts , I find a relation to my own .
You will perhaps smile at me when I tell you that , ever since I have known this man , I have <unk> entertained the idea that all the good fortune which has <unk> me <unk> from him .
However , I have managed to live thirty years without this protection , you will say ; but I will endeavor a little to <unk> my meaning .
He invited me to dine with him on Saturday , which was a very natural thing for him to do .
Well , what have I learned since ?
That your mother and M. de Villefort are both coming to this dinner .
I shall meet them there , and who knows what future advantages may result from the interview ?
This may appear to you to be no unusual <unk> of circumstances ; nevertheless , I perceive some hidden plot in the arrangement — something , in fact , more than is apparent on a <unk> view of the subject .
I believe that this singular man , who appears to <unk> the motives of everyone , has <unk> arranged for me to meet M. and Madame de Villefort , and sometimes , I confess , I have gone so far as to try to read in his eyes whether he was in possession of the secret of our love . ” “ My good friend , ” said Valentine , “ I should take you for a <unk> , and should tremble for your reason , if I were always to hear you talk in a strain similar to this .
Is it possible that you can see anything more than the <unk> chance in this meeting ?
Pray reflect a little .
My father , who never goes out , has several times been on the point of <unk> this invitation ; Madame de Villefort , on the contrary , is burning with the desire of seeing this extraordinary <unk> in his own house , therefore , she has with great difficulty prevailed on my father to accompany her .
No , no ; it is as I have said , Maximilian , — there is no one in the world of whom I can ask help but yourself and my grandfather , who is little better than a corpse — no support to <unk> to but my mother in heaven ! ” “ I see that you are right , <unk> speaking , ” said Maximilian ; “ but the gentle voice which usually has such power over me <unk> to convince me today . ” “ I feel the same as <unk> yourself . ” said Valentine ; “ and I own that , if you have no stronger proof to give me — — ” “ I have another , ” replied Maximilian ; “ but I fear you will <unk> it even more absurd than the first . ” “ So much the worse , ” said Valentine , smiling .
“ It is , nevertheless , <unk> to my mind .
My ten years of service have also confirmed my ideas on the subject of sudden <unk> , for I have several times owed my life to a mysterious impulse which directed me to move at once either to the right or to the left , in order to escape the ball which killed the comrade fighting by my side , while it left me <unk> . ” “ Dear Maximilian , why not <unk> your escape to my constant prayers for your safety ?
When you are away , I no longer pray for myself , but for you . ” <unk> “ Yes , since you have known me , ” said Morrel , smiling ; “ but that cannot apply to the time previous to our acquaintance , Valentine . ” “ You are very <unk> , and will not give me credit for anything ; but let me hear this second proof , which you yourself own to be absurd . ” “ Well , look through this opening , and you will see the beautiful new horse which I <unk> here . ” “ Ah !
what a beautiful creature ! ” cried Valentine ; “ why did you not bring him close to the gate , so that I could talk to him and <unk> him ? ” “ He is , as you see , a very valuable animal , ” said Maximilian .
“ You know that my means are limited , and that I am what would be designated a man of <unk> <unk> .
Well , I went to a horse <unk> ’ s , where I saw this magnificent horse , which I have named <unk> .
I asked the price ; they told me it was <unk> francs .
I was , therefore , obliged to give it up , as you may imagine , but I own I went away with rather a heavy heart , for the horse had looked at me <unk> , had <unk> his head against me and , when I mounted him , had <unk> in the most delightful way <unk> , so that I was altogether <unk> with him .
The same evening some friends of mine visited me , — M.
de Château-Renaud , M. Debray , and five or six other choice spirits , whom you do not know , even by name .
They proposed a game of _ <unk> _ .
I never play , for I am not rich enough to afford to lose , or sufficiently poor to desire to gain .
But I was at my own house , you understand , so there was nothing to be done but to send for the cards , which I did .
“ Just as they were sitting down to table , M. de Monte Cristo arrived .
He took his seat amongst them ; they played , and I won .
I am almost ashamed to say that my <unk> <unk> to <unk> francs .
We separated at midnight .
I could not <unk> my pleasure , so I took a cabriolet and drove to the horse <unk> ’ s .
<unk> and excited , I rang at the door .
The person who opened it must have taken me for a madman , for I rushed at once to the <unk> .
<unk> was standing at the <unk> , eating his <unk> .
I immediately put on the <unk> and <unk> , to which operation he lent himself with the best grace possible ; then , putting the <unk> francs into the hands of the astonished <unk> , I proceeded to fulfil my intention of passing the night in <unk> in the Champs-Élysées .
As I <unk> by the count ’ s house I perceived a light in one of the windows , and fancied I saw the shadow of his figure moving behind the curtain .
Now , Valentine , I firmly believe that he knew of my wish to possess this horse , and that he lost <unk> to give me the means of <unk> him . ” “ My dear Maximilian , you are really too <unk> ; you will not love even me long .
A man who <unk> himself to live in such a world of <unk> and imagination must find far too little excitement in a common , <unk> sort of attachment such as ours .
But they are calling me .
Do you hear ? ” “ Ah , Valentine , ” said Maximilian , “ give me but one finger through this opening in the grating , one finger , the <unk> finger of all , that I may have the happiness of <unk> it . ” “ Maximilian , we said we would be to each other as two voices , two shadows . ” “ As you will , Valentine . ” “ Shall you be happy if I do what you wish ? ” “ Oh , yes ! ” Valentine mounted on a bench , and passed not only her finger but her whole hand through the opening .
Maximilian uttered a cry of delight , and , <unk> <unk> , seized the hand extended towards him , and <unk> on it a <unk> and <unk> kiss .
The little hand was then immediately <unk> , and the young man saw Valentine hurrying towards the house , as though she were almost terrified at her own sensations .
Chapter <unk> .
M. Noirtier de Villefort We will now relate what was passing in the house of the king ’ s attorney after the departure of Madame Danglars and her daughter , and during the time of the conversation between Maximilian and Valentine , which we have just <unk> .
M. de Villefort entered his father ’ s room , followed by Madame de Villefort .
Both of the visitors , after <unk> the old man and speaking to Barrois , a faithful servant , who had been twenty-five years in his service , took their places on either side of the <unk> .
M. Noirtier was sitting in an armchair , which moved upon <unk> , in which he was <unk> into the room in the morning , and in the same way drawn out again at night .
He was placed before a large glass , which reflected the whole apartment , and so , without any attempt to move , which would have been impossible , he could see all who entered the room and everything which was going on around him .
M. Noirtier , although almost as <unk> as a corpse , looked at the <unk> with a quick and intelligent expression , perceiving at once , by their <unk> <unk> , that they were come on business of an unexpected and official character .
<unk> and hearing were the only senses remaining , and they , like two solitary <unk> , remained to <unk> the miserable body which seemed fit for nothing but the grave ; it was only , however , by means of one of these senses that he could reveal the thoughts and feelings that still occupied his mind , and the look by which he gave expression to his inner life was like the distant gleam of a candle which a traveller sees by night across some desert place , and knows that a living being <unk> beyond the silence and obscurity .
Noirtier ’ s hair was long and white , and flowed over his shoulders ; while in his eyes , <unk> by thick black <unk> , was <unk> , as it often happens with an <unk> which is used to the <unk> of the others , all the activity , address , force , and intelligence which were formerly <unk> over his whole body ; and so although the movement of the arm , the sound of the voice , and the <unk> of the body , were wanting , the speaking eye sufficed for all .
He commanded with it ; it was the medium through which his thanks were conveyed .
In short , his whole appearance produced on the mind the impression of a corpse with living eyes , and nothing could be more startling than to observe the expression of anger or joy suddenly <unk> up these <unk> , while the rest of the <unk> and <unk> features were utterly deprived of the power of <unk> .
Three persons only could understand this language of the poor <unk> ; these were Villefort , Valentine , and the old servant of whom we have already spoken .
But as Villefort saw his father but seldom , and then only when absolutely obliged , and as he never took any pains to please or <unk> him when he was there , all the old man ’ s happiness was <unk> in his <unk> .
Valentine , by means of her love , her patience , and her devotion , had learned to read in Noirtier ’ s look all the varied feelings which were passing in his mind .
To this <unk> language , which was so <unk> to others , she answered by throwing her whole soul into the expression of her countenance , and in this manner were the <unk> sustained between the <unk> girl and the helpless invalid , whose body could scarcely be called a living one , but who , nevertheless , possessed a <unk> of knowledge and <unk> , united with a will as powerful as ever although <unk> by a body rendered utterly incapable of <unk> its <unk> .
Valentine had <unk> the problem , and was able easily to understand his thoughts , and to convey her own in return , and , through her <unk> and devoted <unk> , it was seldom that , in the ordinary <unk> of <unk> life , she failed to <unk> the wishes of the living , thinking mind , or the wants of the almost <unk> body .
As to the servant , he had , as we have said , been with his master for <unk> years , therefore he knew all his habits , and it was seldom that Noirtier found it necessary to ask for anything , so <unk> was he in <unk> to all the <unk> of the invalid .
Villefort did not need the help of either Valentine or the domestic in order to carry on with his father the strange conversation which he was about to begin .
As we have said , he perfectly understood the old man ’ s <unk> , and if he did not use it more often , it was only indifference and _ <unk> _ which prevented him from so doing .
He therefore allowed Valentine to go into the garden , sent away Barrois , and after having seated himself at his father ’ s right hand , while Madame de Villefort placed herself on the left , he addressed him thus : “ I trust you will not be displeased , sir , that Valentine has not come with us , or that I <unk> Barrois , for our <unk> will be one which could not with <unk> be carried on in the presence of either .
Madame de Villefort and I have a communication to make to you . ” Noirtier ’ s face remained perfectly <unk> during this long <unk> , while , on the contrary , Villefort ’ s eye was endeavoring to penetrate into the <unk> <unk> of the old man ’ s heart .
“ This communication , ” continued the procureur , in that cold and decisive tone which seemed at once to <unk> all discussion , “ will , we are sure , meet with your approbation . ” The eye of the invalid still retained that <unk> of expression which prevented his son from obtaining any knowledge of the feelings which were passing in his mind ; he listened , nothing more .
“ Sir , ” resumed Villefort , “ we are thinking of marrying Valentine . ” Had the old man ’ s face been <unk> in wax it could not have shown less emotion at this news than was now to be traced there .
“ The marriage will take place in less than three months , ” said Villefort .
Noirtier ’ s eye still retained its <unk> expression .
Madame de Villefort now took her part in the conversation and added : “ We thought this news would possess an interest for you , sir , who have always entertained a great affection for Valentine ; it therefore only now remains for us to tell you the name of the young man for whom she is destined .
It is one of the most desirable <unk> which could possibly be formed ; he possesses fortune , a high rank in society , and every personal <unk> likely to render Valentine <unk> happy , — his name , moreover , cannot be wholly unknown to you .
It is M. Franz de <unk> , Baron d ’ Épinay . ” While his wife was speaking , Villefort had <unk> watched the old man ’ s countenance .
When Madame de Villefort pronounced the name of Franz , the <unk> of M. Noirtier ’ s eye began to <unk> , and his eyelids trembled with the same movement that may be perceived on the lips of an individual about to speak , and he darted a lightning glance at Madame de Villefort and his son .
The procureur , who knew the political hatred which had formerly existed between M. Noirtier and the elder d ’ Épinay , well understood the agitation and anger which the <unk> had produced ; but , <unk> not to perceive either , he immediately resumed the <unk> begun by his wife .
“ Sir , ” said he , “ you are aware that Valentine is about to enter her nineteenth year , which renders it important that she should lose no time in forming a suitable alliance .
Nevertheless , you have not been forgotten in our plans , and we have fully <unk> beforehand that Valentine ’ s future husband will consent , not to live in this house , for that might not be pleasant for the young people , but that you should live with them ; so that you and Valentine , who are so attached to each other , would not be separated , and you would be able to pursue exactly the same course of life which you have hitherto done , and thus , instead of losing , you will be a <unk> by the change , as it will secure to you two children instead of one , to watch over and comfort you . ” <unk> Noirtier ’ s look was furious ; it was very evident that something desperate was passing in the old man ’ s mind , for a cry of anger and grief rose in his throat , and not being able to find vent in utterance , appeared almost to <unk> him , for his face and lips turned quite purple with the struggle .
Villefort quietly opened a window , saying , “ It is very warm , and the heat <unk> M. Noirtier . ” He then returned to his place , but did not sit down .
“ This marriage , ” added Madame de Villefort , “ is quite agreeable to the wishes of M. d ’ Épinay and his family ; besides , he had no relations nearer than an uncle and aunt , his mother having died at his birth , and his father having been assassinated in 1815 , that is to say , when he was but two years old ; it naturally followed that the child was permitted to choose his own <unk> , and he has , therefore , seldom acknowledged any other authority but that of his own will . ” “ That <unk> was a mysterious affair , ” said Villefort , “ and the <unk> have hitherto escaped <unk> , although suspicion has fallen on the head of more than one person . ” Noirtier made such an effort that his lips <unk> into a smile .
“ Now , ” continued Villefort , “ those to whom the guilt really belongs , by whom the crime was committed , on whose heads the justice of man may probably descend here , and the certain judgment of God <unk> , would rejoice in the opportunity thus afforded of <unk> such a <unk> as Valentine on the son of him whose life they so <unk> destroyed . ” Noirtier had succeeded in <unk> his emotion more than could have been <unk> possible with such an <unk> and <unk> frame .
“ Yes , I understand , ” was the reply contained in his look ; and this look expressed a feeling of strong indignation , mixed with profound contempt .
Villefort fully understood his father ’ s meaning , and answered by a slight <unk> of his shoulders .
He then motioned to his wife to take leave .
“ Now sir , ” said Madame de Villefort , “ I must <unk> you farewell .
Would you like me to send Edward to you for a short time ? ” It had been agreed that the old man should express his approbation by closing his eyes , his refusal by <unk> them several times , and if he had some desire or feeling to express , he raised them to heaven .
If he wanted Valentine , he closed his right eye only , and if Barrois , the left .
At Madame de Villefort ’ s <unk> he instantly <unk> his eyes .
<unk> by a complete refusal , she bit her lip and said , “ Then shall I send Valentine to you ? ” The old man closed his eyes eagerly , <unk> <unk> that such was his wish .
M. and Madame de Villefort bowed and left the room , giving orders that Valentine should be summoned to her grandfather ’ s presence , and feeling sure that she would have much to do to restore calmness to the <unk> spirit of the invalid .
Valentine , with a color still <unk> by emotion , entered the room just after her parents had quitted it .
One look was sufficient to tell her that her grandfather was suffering , and that there was much on his mind which he was wishing to communicate to her .
“ Dear grandpapa , ” cried she , “ what has happened ?
They have vexed you , and you are angry ? ” The <unk> closed his eyes in <unk> of <unk> .
“ Who has displeased you ?
Is it my father ? ” “ No . ” “ Madame de Villefort ? ” “ No . ” “ <unk> ? ” The former sign was repeated .
“ Are you displeased with me ? ” cried Valentine in astonishment .
M. Noirtier again closed his eyes .
“ And what have I done , dear grandpapa , that you should be angry with me ? ” cried Valentine .
There was no answer , and she continued : “ I have not seen you all day .
Has anyone been speaking to you against me ? ” “ Yes , ” said the old man ’ s look , with eagerness .
“ Let me think a moment .
I do assure you , grandpapa — Ah — M.
and Madame de Villefort have just left this room , have they not ? ” “ Yes . ” “ And it was they who told you something which made you angry ?
What was it then ?
May I go and ask them , that I may have the opportunity of making my peace with you ? ” “ No , no , ” said Noirtier ’ s look .
“ Ah , you <unk> me .
What can they have said ? ” and she again tried to think what it could be .
“ Ah , I know , ” said she , <unk> her voice and going close to the old man .
“ They have been speaking of my marriage , — have they not ? ” “ Yes , ” replied the angry look .
“ I understand ; you are displeased at the silence I have preserved on the subject .
The reason of it was , that they had insisted on my keeping the matter a secret , and begged me not to tell you anything of it .
They did not even <unk> me with their intentions , and I only discovered them by chance , that is why I have been so reserved with you , dear grandpapa .
Pray forgive me . ” But there was no look calculated to <unk> her ; all it seemed to say was , “ It is not only your reserve which <unk> me . ” “ What is it , then ? ” asked the young girl .
“ Perhaps you think I shall abandon you , dear grandpapa , and that I shall forget you when I am married ? ” “ No . ” “ They told you , then , that M. d ’ Épinay <unk> to our all living together ? ” “ Yes . ” “ Then why are you still vexed and grieved ? ” The old man ’ s eyes <unk> with an expression of gentle affection .
“ Yes , I understand , ” said Valentine ; “ it is because you love me . ” The old man <unk> .
“ And you are afraid I shall be unhappy ? ” “ Yes . ” “ You do not like M. Franz ? ” The eyes repeated several times , “ No , no , no . ” “ Then you are vexed with the engagement ? ” “ Yes . ” “ Well , listen , ” said Valentine , throwing herself on her knees , and putting her arm round her grandfather ’ s neck , “ I am vexed , too , for I do not love M. Franz d ’ Épinay . ” An expression of intense joy <unk> the old man ’ s eyes .
“ When I wished to retire into a convent , you remember how angry you were with me ? ” A tear trembled in the eye of the invalid .
“ Well , ” continued Valentine , “ the reason of my <unk> it was that I might escape this <unk> marriage , which <unk> me to despair . ” Noirtier ’ s breathing came thick and short .
“ Then the idea of this marriage really <unk> you too ?
Ah , if you could but help me — if we could both together <unk> their plan !
But you are unable to oppose them , — you , whose mind is so quick , and whose will is so firm are nevertheless , as weak and <unk> to the <unk> as I am myself .
Alas , you , who would have been such a powerful protector to me in the days of your health and strength , can now only <unk> in my joys and sorrows , without being able to take any active part in them .
However , this is much , and calls for gratitude and Heaven has not taken away all my <unk> when it leaves me your sympathy and kindness . ” At these words there appeared in Noirtier ’ s eye an expression of such deep meaning that the young girl thought she could read these words there : “ You are mistaken ; I can still do much for you . ” “ Do you think you can help me , dear grandpapa ? ” said Valentine .
“ Yes . ” Noirtier raised his eyes , it was the sign agreed on between him and Valentine when he wanted anything .
“ What is it you want , dear grandpapa ? ” said Valentine , and she endeavored to recall to mind all the things which he would be likely to need ; and as the ideas presented themselves to her mind , she repeated them aloud , then , — finding that all her efforts <unk> nothing but a constant _ “ No , ” _ — she said , “ Come , since this plan does not answer , I will have <unk> to another . ” She then <unk> all the letters of the <unk> from A down to <unk> When she arrived at that letter the <unk> made her understand that she had spoken the <unk> letter of the thing he wanted .
“ Ah , ” said Valentine , “ the thing you desire begins with the letter <unk> ; it is with <unk> that we have to do , then .
Well , let me see , what can you want that begins with <unk> ?
<unk> — <unk> — <unk> — No — — ” “ Yes , yes , yes , ” said the old man ’ s eye .
“ Ah , it is No , then ? ” “ Yes . ” Valentine <unk> a <unk> , which she placed on a desk before Noirtier ; she opened it , and , seeing that the old man ’ s eye was thoroughly fixed on its pages , she ran her finger quickly up and down the <unk> .
During the six years which had passed since Noirtier first fell into this sad state , Valentine ’ s powers of <unk> had been too often put to the <unk> not to render her <unk> in <unk> <unk> for <unk> a knowledge of his wishes , and the constant practice had so <unk> her in the art that she guessed the old man ’ s meaning as quickly as if he himself had been able to seek for what he wanted .
At the word _ <unk> _ , Noirtier made a sign to her to stop .
<unk> “ <unk> , ” said she , “ do you want a notary , dear grandpapa ? ” The old man again signified that it was a notary he desired .
“ You would wish a notary to be sent for then ? ” said Valentine .
“ Yes . ” “ Shall my father be informed of your wish ? ” “ Yes . ” “ Do you wish the notary to be sent for immediately ? ” “ Yes . ” “ Then they shall go for him directly , dear grandpapa .
Is that all you want ? ” “ Yes . ” Valentine rang the bell , and ordered the servant to tell Monsieur or Madame de Villefort that they were requested to come to M. Noirtier ’ s room .
“ Are you satisfied now ? ” inquired Valentine .
“ Yes . ” “ I am sure you are ; it is not very difficult to discover that . ” And the young girl smiled on her grandfather , as if he had been a child .
M. de Villefort entered , followed by Barrois .
“ What do you want me for , sir ? ” demanded he of the <unk> .
“ Sir , ” said Valentine , “ my grandfather wishes for a notary . ” At this strange and unexpected demand M. de Villefort and his father exchanged looks .
“ Yes , ” motioned the latter , with a <unk> which seemed to declare that with the help of Valentine and his old servant , who both knew what his wishes were , he was quite prepared to <unk> the <unk> .
“ Do you wish for a notary ? ” asked Villefort .
“ Yes . ” “ What to do ? ” Noirtier made no answer .
“ What do you want with a notary ? ” again repeated Villefort .
The invalid ’ s eye remained fixed , by which expression he intended to intimate that his resolution was <unk> .
“ Is it to do us some ill turn ?
Do you think it is worth while ? ” said Villefort .
“ Still , ” said Barrois , with the freedom and <unk> of an old servant , “ if M. Noirtier <unk> for a notary , I suppose he really wishes for a notary ; therefore I shall go at once and fetch one . ” Barrois acknowledged no master but Noirtier , and never allowed his desires in any way to be <unk> .
<unk> “ Yes , I do want a notary , ” motioned the old man , <unk> his eyes with a look of <unk> , which seemed to say , “ and I should like to see the person who <unk> to refuse my request . ” “ You shall have a notary , as you absolutely wish for one , sir , ” said Villefort ; “ but I shall explain to him your state of health , and make <unk> for you , for the scene cannot fail of being a most ridiculous one . ” “ Never mind that , ” said Barrois ; “ I shall go and fetch a notary , nevertheless . ” And the old servant departed <unk> on his mission .
Chapter <unk> .
The Will As soon as Barrois had left the room , Noirtier looked at Valentine with a malicious expression that said many things .
The young girl perfectly understood the look , and so did Villefort , for his countenance became <unk> , and he <unk> his eyebrows <unk> .
He took a seat , and quietly awaited the arrival of the notary .
Noirtier saw him seat himself with an appearance of perfect indifference , at the same time giving a side look at Valentine , which made her understand that she also was to remain in the room .
<unk> of an hour after , Barrois returned , bringing the notary with him .
“ Sir , ” said Villefort , after the first <unk> were over , “ you were sent for by M. Noirtier , whom you see here .
All his limbs have become completely <unk> , he has lost his voice also , and we ourselves find much trouble in endeavoring to catch some <unk> of his meaning . ” Noirtier cast an <unk> look on Valentine , which look was at once so earnest and <unk> , that she answered immediately .
“ Sir , ” said she , “ I perfectly understand my grandfather ’ s meaning at all times . ” “ That is quite true , ” said Barrois ; “ and that is what I told the gentleman as we walked along . ” “ <unk> me , ” said the notary , turning first to Villefort and then to Valentine — “ permit me to state that the case in question is just one of those in which a public officer like myself cannot proceed to act without <unk> <unk> a dangerous <unk> .
The first thing necessary to render an act <unk> is , that the notary should be thoroughly convinced that he has <unk> <unk> the will and wishes of the person <unk> the act .
Now I cannot be sure of the approbation or <unk> of a <unk> who cannot speak , and as the object of his desire or his <unk> cannot be clearly proved to me , on account of his want of speech , my services here would be quite useless , and cannot be <unk> exercised . ” The notary then prepared to retire .
An imperceptible smile of triumph was expressed on the lips of the procureur .
Noirtier looked at Valentine with an expression so full of grief , that she arrested the departure of the notary .
“ Sir , ” said she , “ the language which I speak with my grandfather may be easily <unk> , and I can teach you in a few minutes , to understand it almost as well as I can myself .
Will you tell me what you require , in order to set your conscience quite at ease on the subject ? ” “ In order to render an act <unk> , I must be certain of the approbation or <unk> of my <unk> .
<unk> of body would not affect the <unk> of the deed , but <unk> of mind is absolutely requisite . ” “ Well , sir , by the help of two signs , with which I will <unk> you presently , you may ascertain with perfect certainty that my grandfather is still in the full possession of all his mental <unk> .
M. Noirtier , being deprived of voice and motion , is accustomed to convey his meaning by closing his eyes when he wishes to signify ‘ yes , ’ and to <unk> when he means ‘ no . ’ You now know quite enough to <unk> you to <unk> with M. Noirtier ; — try . ” Noirtier gave Valentine such a look of tenderness and gratitude that it was comprehended even by the notary himself .
“ You have heard and understood what your <unk> has been saying , sir , have you ? ” asked the notary .
Noirtier closed his eyes .
“ And you approve of what she said — that is to say , you declare that the signs which she mentioned are really those by means of which you are accustomed to convey your thoughts ? ” “ Yes . ” “ It was you who sent for me ? ” “ Yes . ” “ To make your will ? ” “ Yes . ” “ And you do not wish me to go away without <unk> your original intentions ? ” The old man <unk> violently .
“ Well , sir , ” said the young girl , “ do you understand now , and is your conscience perfectly at rest on the subject ? ” But before the notary could answer , Villefort had drawn him aside .
“ Sir , ” said he , “ do you suppose for a moment that a man can <unk> a physical shock , such as M. Noirtier has received , without any <unk> to his mental <unk> ? ” “ It is not exactly that , sir , ” said the notary , “ which makes me uneasy , but the difficulty will be in <unk> his thoughts and intentions , so as to be able to get his <unk> . ” “ You must see that to be an utter <unk> , ” said Villefort .
Valentine and the old man heard this conversation , and Noirtier fixed his eye so earnestly on Valentine that she felt bound to answer to the look .
“ Sir , ” said she , “ that need not make you uneasy , however difficult it may at first sight appear to be .
I can discover and explain to you my grandfather ’ s thoughts , so as to put an end to all your doubts and fears on the subject .
I have now been six years with M. Noirtier , and let him tell you if ever once , during that time , he has entertained a thought which he was unable to make me understand . ” “ No , ” signed the old man .
“ Let us try what we can do , then , ” said the notary .
