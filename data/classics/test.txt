“ You accept this young lady as your <unk> , M. Noirtier ? ” “ Yes . ” “ Well , sir , what do you require of me , and what <unk> is it that you wish to be drawn up ? ” Valentine named all the letters of the <unk> until she came to <unk> At this letter the <unk> eye of Noirtier gave her notice that she was to stop .
“ It is very evident that it is the letter <unk> which M. Noirtier wants , ” said the notary .
“ Wait , ” said Valentine ; and , turning to her grandfather , she repeated , “ <unk> — We — <unk> — — ” The old man stopped her at the last syllable .
Valentine then took the <unk> , and the notary watched her while she turned over the pages .
She passed her finger slowly down the <unk> , and when she came to the word “ Will , ” M. Noirtier ’ s eye bade her stop .
“ Will , ” said the notary ; “ it is very evident that M. Noirtier is desirous of making his will . ” “ Yes , yes , yes , ” motioned the invalid .
“ Really , sir , you must allow that this is most extraordinary , ” said the astonished notary , turning to M. de Villefort .
“ Yes , ” said the procureur , “ and I think the will promises to be yet more extraordinary , for I cannot see how it is to be drawn up without the <unk> of Valentine , and she may , perhaps , be considered as too much interested in its contents to allow of her being a suitable <unk> of the obscure and <unk> wishes of her grandfather . ” “ No , no , no , ” replied the eye of the <unk> .
“ What ? ” said Villefort , “ do you mean to say that Valentine is not interested in your will ? ” “ No . ” “ Sir , ” said the notary , whose interest had been greatly excited , and who had resolved on <unk> far and wide the account of this extraordinary and picturesque scene , “ what appeared so impossible to me an hour ago , has now become quite easy and <unk> , and this may be a perfectly <unk> will , provided it be read in the presence of seven witnesses , approved by the <unk> , and sealed by the notary in the presence of the witnesses .
As to the time , it will not require very much more than the <unk> of <unk> .
There are certain forms necessary to be gone through , and which are always the same .
As to the details , the greater part will be furnished afterwards by the state in which we find the affairs of the <unk> , and by yourself , who , having had the <unk> of them , can doubtless give full information on the subject .
But besides all this , in order that the instrument may not be <unk> , I am anxious to give it the greatest possible <unk> , therefore , one of my <unk> will help me , and , contrary to custom , will assist in the <unk> of the <unk> .
Are you satisfied , sir ? ” continued the notary , addressing the old man .
<unk> “ Yes , ” looked the invalid , his eye <unk> with delight at the ready <unk> of his meaning .
“ What is he going to do ? ” thought Villefort , whose position demanded much reserve , but who was <unk> to know what his father ’ s intentions were .
He left the room to give orders for another notary to be sent , but Barrois , who had heard all that passed , had guessed his master ’ s wishes , and had already gone to fetch one .
The procureur then told his wife to come up .
In the course of a quarter of an hour everyone had assembled in the chamber of the <unk> ; the second notary had also arrived .
A few words sufficed for a mutual understanding between the two officers of the law .
They read to Noirtier the formal copy of a will , in order to give him an idea of the terms in which such documents are generally <unk> ; then , in order to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , the first notary said , turning towards him : “ When an individual makes his will , it is generally in favor or in <unk> of some person . ” “ Yes . ” “ Have you an exact idea of the amount of your fortune ? ” “ Yes . ” “ I will name to you several <unk> which will increase by <unk> ; you will stop me when I reach the one <unk> the amount of your own <unk> ? ” “ Yes . ” There was a kind of solemnity in this <unk> .
Never had the struggle between mind and matter been more apparent than now , and if it was not a sublime , it was , at least , a curious spectacle .
They had formed a circle round the invalid ; the second notary was sitting at a table , prepared for writing , and his <unk> was standing before the <unk> in the act of <unk> him on the subject to which we have <unk> .
“ Your fortune <unk> <unk> francs , does it not ? ” asked he .
Noirtier made a sign that it did .
“ Do you possess <unk> francs ? ” inquired the notary .
Noirtier ’ s eye remained <unk> .
“ <unk> ? ” The same expression continued .
“ <unk> — <unk> — <unk> — <unk> ? ” Noirtier stopped him at the <unk> sum .
“ You are then in possession of <unk> francs ? ” asked the notary .
“ Yes . ” “ In landed property ? ” “ No . ” “ In stock ? ” “ Yes . ” “ The stock is in your own hands ? ” The look which M. Noirtier cast on Barrois showed that there was something wanting which he knew where to find .
The old servant left the room , and presently returned , bringing with him a small <unk> .
“ Do you permit us to open this <unk> ? ” asked the notary .
Noirtier gave his <unk> .
They opened it , and found <unk> francs in bank <unk> .
The first notary handed over each note , as he examined it , to his <unk> .
The total amount was found to be as M. Noirtier had stated .
“ It is all as he has said ; it is very evident that the mind still <unk> its full force and <unk> . ” Then , turning towards the <unk> , he said , “ You possess , then , <unk> francs of capital , which , according to the manner in which you have <unk> it , ought to bring in an income of about <unk> livres ? ” “ Yes . ” “ To whom do you desire to leave this fortune ? ” “ Oh ! ” said Madame de Villefort , “ there is not much doubt on that subject .
M. Noirtier tenderly loves his <unk> , Mademoiselle de Villefort ; it is she who has <unk> and <unk> him for six years , and has , by her devoted attention , fully secured the affection , I had almost said the gratitude , of her grandfather , and it is but just that she should <unk> the fruit of her devotion . ” The eye of Noirtier clearly showed by its expression that he was not deceived by the false <unk> given by Madame de Villefort ’ s words and manner to the motives which she supposed him to entertain .
“ Is it , then , to Mademoiselle Valentine de Villefort that you leave these <unk> francs ? ” demanded the notary , thinking he had only to <unk> this <unk> , but waiting first for the <unk> of Noirtier , which it was necessary should be given before all the witnesses of this singular scene .
Valentine , when her name was made the subject of discussion , had stepped back , to escape unpleasant observation ; her eyes were cast down , and she was crying .
The old man looked at her for an instant with an expression of the <unk> tenderness , then , turning towards the notary , he <unk> <unk> his eye in <unk> of <unk> .
“ What , ” said the notary , “ do you not intend making Mademoiselle Valentine de Villefort your <unk> <unk> ? ” “ No . ” “ You are not making any mistake , are you ? ” said the notary ; “ you really mean to declare that such is not your intention ? ” “ No , ” repeated Noirtier ; “ No . ” Valentine raised her head , struck <unk> with astonishment .
It was not so much the conviction that she was <unk> that caused her grief , but her total <unk> to account for the feelings which had <unk> her grandfather to such an act .
But Noirtier looked at her with so much affectionate tenderness that she exclaimed : “ Oh , grandpapa , I see now that it is only your fortune of which you <unk> me ; you still leave me the love which I have always enjoyed . ” “ Ah , yes , most assuredly , ” said the eyes of the <unk> , for he closed them with an expression which Valentine could not mistake .
“ Thank you , thank you , ” murmured she .
The old man ’ s declaration that Valentine was not the destined <unk> of his fortune had excited the hopes of Madame de Villefort ; she gradually approached the invalid , and said : “ Then , doubtless , dear M. Noirtier , you intend leaving your fortune to your <unk> , Edward de Villefort ? ” The <unk> of the eyes which answered this speech was most decided and terrible , and expressed a feeling almost <unk> to hatred .
“ No ? ” said the notary ; “ then , perhaps , it is to your son , M. de Villefort ? ” “ No . ” The two <unk> looked at each other in mute astonishment and inquiry as to what were the real intentions of the <unk> .
Villefort and his wife both grew red , one from shame , the other from anger .
“ What have we all done , then , dear grandpapa ? ” said Valentine ; “ you no longer seem to love any of us ? ” The old man ’ s eyes passed rapidly from Villefort and his wife , and rested on Valentine with a look of <unk> <unk> .
“ Well , ” said she ; “ if you love me , grandpapa , try and bring that love to bear upon your actions at this present moment .
You know me well enough to be quite sure that I have never thought of your fortune ; besides , they say I am already rich in right of my mother — too rich , even .
<unk> yourself , then . ” Noirtier fixed his intelligent eyes on Valentine ’ s hand .
“ My hand ? ” said she .
“ Yes . ” “ Her hand ! ” exclaimed everyone .
“ Oh , gentlemen , you see it is all useless , and that my father ’ s mind is really <unk> , ” said Villefort .
“ Ah , ” cried Valentine suddenly , “ I understand .
It is my marriage you mean , is it not , dear grandpapa ? ” “ Yes , yes , yes , ” signed the <unk> , casting on Valentine a look of <unk> gratitude for having guessed his meaning .
<unk> “ You are angry with us all on account of this marriage , are you not ? ” “ Yes ? ” “ Really , this is too absurd , ” said Villefort .
“ Excuse me , sir , ” replied the notary ; “ on the contrary , the meaning of M. Noirtier is quite evident to me , and I can quite easily <unk> the train of ideas passing in his mind . ” “ You do not wish me to marry M. Franz d ’ Épinay ? ” observed Valentine .
“ I do not wish it , ” said the eye of her grandfather .
“ And you <unk> your <unk> , ” continued the notary , “ because she has contracted an engagement contrary to your wishes ? ” “ Yes . ” “ So that , but for this marriage , she would have been your heir ? ” “ Yes . ” There was a profound silence .
The two <unk> were holding a <unk> as to the best means of proceeding with the affair .
Valentine was looking at her grandfather with a smile of intense gratitude , and Villefort was <unk> his lips with <unk> , while Madame de Villefort could not succeed in <unk> an inward feeling of joy , which , in spite of herself , appeared in her whole countenance .
“ But , ” said Villefort , who was the first to break the silence , “ I consider that I am the best judge of the <unk> of the marriage in question .
I am the only person <unk> the right to <unk> of my daughter ’ s hand .
It is my wish that she should marry M. Franz d ’ Épinay — and she shall marry him . ” Valentine sank weeping into a chair .
“ Sir , ” said the notary , “ how do you intend <unk> of your fortune in case Mademoiselle de Villefort still <unk> on marrying M. Franz ? ” The old man gave no answer .
“ You will , of course , <unk> of it in some way or other ? ” “ Yes . ” “ In favor of some member of your family ? ” “ No . ” “ Do you intend <unk> it to charitable <unk> , then ? ” pursued the notary .
“ Yes . ” “ But , ” said the notary , “ you are aware that the law does not allow a son to be entirely deprived of his <unk> ? ” “ Yes . ” “ You only intend , then , to <unk> of that part of your fortune which the law <unk> you to <unk> from the <unk> of your son ? ” Noirtier made no answer .
“ Do you still wish to <unk> of all ? ” “ Yes . ” “ But they will <unk> the will after your death ? ” “ No . ” “ My father knows me , ” replied Villefort ; “ he is quite sure that his wishes will be held sacred by me ; besides , he <unk> that in my position I cannot <unk> against the poor . ” The eye of Noirtier <unk> with triumph .
“ What do you decide on , sir ? ” asked the notary of Villefort .
“ Nothing , sir ; it is a resolution which my father has taken and I know he never <unk> his mind .
I am quite resigned .
These <unk> francs will go out of the family in order to <unk> some hospital ; but it is ridiculous thus to yield to the <unk> of an old man , and I shall , therefore , act according to my conscience . ” Having said this , Villefort quitted the room with his wife , leaving his father at liberty to do as he pleased .
The same day the will was made , the witnesses were brought , it was approved by the old man , sealed in the presence of all and given in charge to M. <unk> , the family notary .
Chapter <unk> .
The <unk> M. and Madame de Villefort found on their return that the Count of Monte Cristo , who had come to visit them in their absence , had been <unk> into the drawing-room , and was still awaiting them there .
Madame de Villefort , who had not yet sufficiently recovered from her late emotion to allow of her <unk> visitors so immediately , retired to her bedroom , while the procureur , who could better depend upon himself , proceeded at once to the salon .
Although M. de Villefort flattered himself that , to all <unk> view , he had completely masked the feelings which were passing in his mind , he did not know that the cloud was still <unk> on his brow , so much so that the count , whose smile was radiant , immediately noticed his sombre and thoughtful air .
“ _ Ma foi ! _ ” said Monte Cristo , after the first compliments were over , “ what is the matter with you , M. de Villefort ?
Have I arrived at the moment when you were drawing up an <unk> for a capital crime ? ” Villefort tried to smile .
“ No , count , ” he replied , “ I am the only victim in this case .
It is I who lose my cause , and it is <unk> , <unk> , and folly which have caused it to be decided against me . ” “ To what do you <unk> ? ” said Monte Cristo with <unk> interest .
“ Have you really met with some great misfortune ? ” “ Oh , no , monsieur , ” said Villefort with a bitter smile ; “ it is only a loss of money which I have sustained — nothing worth <unk> , I assure you . ” “ True , ” said Monte Cristo , “ the loss of a sum of money becomes almost <unk> with a fortune such as you possess , and to one of your <unk> spirit . ” “ It is not so much the loss of the money that <unk> me , ” said Villefort , “ though , after all , <unk> francs are worth <unk> ; but I am the more <unk> with this fate , chance , or whatever you please to call the power which has destroyed my hopes and my fortune , and may <unk> the prospects of my child also , as it is all <unk> by an old man <unk> into second childhood . ” <unk> “ What do you say ? ” said the count ; “ <unk> francs ?
It is indeed a sum which might be regretted even by a philosopher .
And who is the cause of all this <unk> ? ” “ My father , as I told you . ” “ M.
Noirtier ?
But I thought you told me he had become entirely <unk> , and that all his <unk> were completely destroyed ? ” “ Yes , his <unk> <unk> , for he can neither move nor speak , nevertheless he thinks , <unk> , and <unk> in the manner I have described .
I left him about five minutes ago , and he is now occupied in <unk> his will to two <unk> . ” “ But to do this he must have spoken ? ” “ He has done better than that — he has made himself understood . ” “ How was such a thing possible ? ” “ By the help of his eyes , which are still full of life , and , as you perceive , possess the power of <unk> mortal <unk> . ” “ My dear , ” said Madame de Villefort , who had just entered the room , “ perhaps you <unk> the evil . ” “ <unk> , madame , ” said the count , bowing .
Madame de Villefort acknowledged the <unk> with one of her most gracious smiles .
“ What is this that M. de Villefort has been telling me ? ” demanded Monte Cristo “ and what <unk> misfortune — — ” “ <unk> is the word ! ” interrupted the procureur , <unk> his shoulders .
“ It is an old man ’ s <unk> ! ” “ And is there no means of making him <unk> his decision ? ” “ Yes , ” said Madame de Villefort ; “ and it is still entirely in the power of my husband to cause the will , which is now in <unk> of Valentine , to be altered in her favor . ” The count , who perceived that M. and Madame de Villefort were beginning to speak in <unk> , appeared to pay no attention to the conversation , and <unk> to be <unk> engaged in watching Edward , who was <unk> <unk> some ink into the bird ’ s <unk> .
“ My dear , ” said Villefort , in answer to his wife , “ you know I have never been accustomed to play the <unk> in my family , nor have I ever considered that the fate of a universe was to be decided by my <unk> .
Nevertheless , it is necessary that my will should be respected in my family , and that the folly of an old man and the <unk> of a child should not be allowed to <unk> a project which I have entertained for so many years .
The Baron d ’ Épinay was my friend , as you know , and an alliance with his son is the most suitable thing that could possibly be arranged . ” “ Do you think , ” said Madame de Villefort , “ that Valentine is in league with him ?
She has always been opposed to this marriage , and I should not be at all surprised if what we have just seen and heard is nothing but the execution of a plan <unk> between them . ” “ Madame , ” said Villefort , “ believe me , a fortune of <unk> francs is not so easily <unk> . ” “ She could , nevertheless , make up her mind to <unk> the world , sir , since it is only about a year ago that she herself proposed entering a convent . ” “ Never mind , ” replied Villefort ; “ I say that this marriage _ shall _ be <unk> . ” “ <unk> your father ’ s wishes to the contrary ? ” said Madame de Villefort , <unk> a new point of attack .
“ That is a serious thing . ” Monte Cristo , who pretended not to be listening , heard however , every word that was said .
<unk> “ Madame , ” replied Villefort “ I can truly say that I have always entertained a high respect for my father , because , to the natural feeling of <unk> was added the consciousness of his moral superiority .
The name of father is sacred in two senses ; he should be <unk> as the author of our being and as a master whom we ought to obey .
But , under the present circumstances , I am <unk> in <unk> the wisdom of an old man who , because he hated the father , <unk> his anger on the son .
It would be ridiculous in me to <unk> my conduct by such <unk> .
I shall still continue to preserve the same respect toward M. Noirtier ; I will suffer , without complaint , the <unk> <unk> to which he has <unk> me ; but I shall remain firm in my determination , and the world shall see which party has reason on his side .
<unk> I shall marry my daughter to the Baron Franz d ’ Épinay , because I consider it would be a proper and <unk> match for her to make , and , in short , because I choose to bestow my daughter ’ s hand on <unk> I please . ” “ What ? ” said the count , the approbation of whose eye Villefort had frequently <unk> during this speech .
“ What ?
Do you say that M. Noirtier <unk> Mademoiselle de Villefort because she is going to marry M. le Baron Franz d ’ Épinay ? ” “ Yes , sir , that is the reason , ” said Villefort , <unk> his shoulders .
“ The apparent reason , at least , ” said Madame de Villefort .
“ The _ real _ reason , madame , I can assure you ; I know my father . ” “ But I want to know in what way M. d ’ Épinay can have displeased your father more than any other person ? ” “ I believe I know M. Franz d ’ Épinay , ” said the count ; “ is he not the son of General de <unk> , who was created Baron d ’ Épinay by Charles <unk> ? ” “ The same , ” said Villefort .
“ Well , but he is a charming young man , according to my ideas . ” “ He is , which makes me believe that it is only an excuse of M. Noirtier to prevent his <unk> marrying ; old men are always so selfish in their affection , ” said Madame de Villefort .
“ But , ” said Monte Cristo “ do you not know any cause for this hatred ? ” “ Ah , _ <unk> foi ! _ who is to know ? ” “ Perhaps it is some political difference ? ” “ My father and the Baron d ’ Épinay lived in the stormy times of which I only saw the <unk> , ” said Villefort .
“ Was not your father a Bonapartist ? ” asked Monte Cristo ; “ I think I remember that you told me something of that kind . ” “ My father has been a <unk> more than anything else , ” said Villefort , carried by his emotion beyond the bounds of prudence ; “ and the <unk> ’ s <unk> , which Napoleon cast on his shoulders , only served to disguise the old man without in any degree changing him .
When my father <unk> , it was not for the emperor , it was against the <unk> ; for M. Noirtier possessed this peculiarity , he never projected any <unk> <unk> which could never be realized , but strove for <unk> , and he applied to the <unk> of these <unk> the terrible <unk> of The <unk> , — <unk> that never <unk> from any means that were <unk> necessary to bring about the desired result . ” “ Well , ” said Monte Cristo , “ it is just as I thought ; it was politics which brought Noirtier and M. d ’ Épinay into personal contact .
Although General d ’ Épinay served under Napoleon , did he not still retain <unk> sentiments ?
And was he not the person who was assassinated one evening on leaving a Bonapartist meeting to which he had been invited on the <unk> that he <unk> the cause of the emperor ? ” Villefort looked at the count almost with terror .
“ Am I mistaken , then ? ” said Monte Cristo .
“ No , sir , the facts were precisely what you have stated , ” said Madame de Villefort ; “ and it was to prevent the <unk> of old <unk> that M. de Villefort formed the idea of <unk> in the bonds of affection the two children of these <unk> enemies . ” “ It was a sublime and charitable thought , ” said Monte Cristo , “ and the whole world should <unk> it .
It would be noble to see Mademoiselle Noirtier de Villefort <unk> the title of Madame Franz d ’ Épinay . ” Villefort shuddered and looked at Monte Cristo as if he wished to read in his countenance the real feelings which had <unk> the words he had just uttered .
But the count completely <unk> the procureur , and prevented him from <unk> anything beneath the <unk> smile he was so constantly in the habit of <unk> .
“ Although , ” said Villefort , “ it will be a serious thing for Valentine to lose her grandfather ’ s fortune , I do not think that M. d ’ Épinay will be frightened at this <unk> loss .
He will , perhaps , hold me in greater esteem than the money itself , seeing that I sacrifice everything in order to keep my word with him .
Besides , he knows that Valentine is rich in right of her mother , and that she will , in all probability , <unk> the fortune of M. and Madame de Saint-Méran , her mother ’ s parents , who both love her tenderly . ” “ And who are fully as well worth loving and <unk> as M. Noirtier , ” said Madame de Villefort ; “ besides , they are to come to Paris in about a month , and Valentine , after the <unk> she has received , need not consider it necessary to continue to <unk> herself alive by being shut up with M. Noirtier . ” The count listened with satisfaction to this tale of wounded <unk> and <unk> ambition .
“ But it seems to me , ” said Monte Cristo , “ and I must begin by asking your pardon for what I am about to say , that if M. Noirtier <unk> Mademoiselle de Villefort because she is going to marry a man whose father he <unk> , he cannot have the same cause of complaint against this dear Edward . ” “ True , ” said Madame de Villefort , with an <unk> of voice which it is impossible to describe ; “ is it not unjust — <unk> unjust ?
Poor Edward is as much M. Noirtier ’ s <unk> as Valentine , and yet , if she had not been going to marry M. Franz , M. Noirtier would have left her all his money ; and supposing Valentine to be <unk> by her grandfather , she will still be three times <unk> than he . ” The count listened and said no more .
“ Count , ” said Villefort , “ we will not entertain you any longer with our family misfortunes .
It is true that my <unk> will go to <unk> charitable <unk> , and my father will have deprived me of my <unk> <unk> without any reason for doing so , but I shall have the satisfaction of knowing that I have acted like a man of sense and feeling .
M. d ’ Épinay , to whom I had promised the interest of this sum , shall receive it , even if I endure the most cruel <unk> . ” “ However , ” said Madame de Villefort , returning to the one idea which incessantly occupied her mind , “ perhaps it would be better to explain this <unk> affair to M. d ’ Épinay , in order to give him the opportunity of himself <unk> his claim to the hand of Mademoiselle de Villefort . ” “ Ah , that would be a great pity , ” said Villefort .
“ A great pity , ” said Monte Cristo .
“ <unk> , ” said Villefort , <unk> the tones of his voice , “ a marriage once <unk> and then broken off , <unk> a sort of <unk> on a young lady ; then again , the old reports , which I was so anxious to put an end to , will instantly gain ground .
No , it will all go well ; M. d ’ Épinay , if he is an honorable man , will consider himself more than ever <unk> to Mademoiselle de Villefort , unless he were <unk> by a decided feeling of <unk> , but that is impossible . ” “ I agree with M. de Villefort , ” said Monte Cristo , fixing his eyes on Madame de Villefort ; “ and if I were sufficiently intimate with him to allow of giving my advice , I would persuade him , since I have been told M. d ’ Épinay is coming back , to settle this affair at once beyond all possibility of <unk> .
I will answer for the success of a project which will reflect so much honor on M. de Villefort . ” The procureur arose , delighted with the <unk> , but his wife slightly changed color .
“ Well , that is all that I wanted , and I will be guided by a <unk> such as you are , ” said he , extending his hand to Monte Cristo .
“ <unk> let everyone here look upon what has passed today as if it had not happened , and as though we had never thought of such a thing as a change in our original plans . ” “ Sir , ” said the count , “ the world , unjust as it is , will be pleased with your resolution ; your friends will be proud of you , and M. d ’ Épinay , even if he took Mademoiselle de Villefort without any <unk> , which he will not do , would be delighted with the idea of entering a family which could make such <unk> in order to keep a promise and fulfil a duty . ” At the conclusion of these words , the count rose to depart .
“ Are you going to leave us , count ? ” said Madame de Villefort .
“ I am sorry to say I must do so , madame , I only came to remind you of your promise for Saturday . ” “ Did you fear that we should forget it ? ” “ You are very good , madame , but M. de Villefort has so many important and <unk> <unk> . ” “ My husband has given me his word , sir , ” said Madame de Villefort ; “ you have just seen him resolve to keep it when he has everything to lose , and surely there is more reason for his doing so where he has everything to gain . ” “ And , ” said Villefort , “ is it at your house in the Champs-Élysées that you receive your visitors ? ” “ No , ” said Monte Cristo , “ which is precisely the reason which renders your kindness more <unk> , — it is in the country . ” “ In the country ? ” “ Yes . ” “ Where is it , then ?
<unk> Paris , is it not ? ” “ Very near , only half a league from the <unk> , — it is at Auteuil . ” “ At Auteuil ? ” said Villefort ; “ true , Madame de Villefort told me you lived at Auteuil , since it was to your house that she was taken .
And in what part of Auteuil do you <unk> ? ” “ Rue de la <unk> . ” “ Rue de la <unk> ! ” exclaimed Villefort in an agitated tone ; “ at what number ? ” “ No .
<unk> . ” “ Then , ” cried Villefort , “ was it you who bought M. de Saint-Méran ’ s house ! ” “ Did it belong to M. de Saint-Méran ? ” demanded Monte Cristo .
“ Yes , ” replied Madame de Villefort ; “ and , would you believe it , count — — ” “ Believe what ? ” “ You think this house pretty , do you not ? ” “ I think it charming . ” “ Well , my husband would never live in it . ” “ Indeed ? ” returned Monte Cristo , “ that is a <unk> on your part , M. de Villefort , for which I am quite at a loss to account . ” “ I do not like Auteuil , sir , ” said the procureur , making an evident effort to appear calm .
“ But I hope you will not carry your <unk> so far as to <unk> me of the pleasure of your company , sir , ” said Monte Cristo .
“ No , count , — I hope — I assure you I shall do my best , ” stammered Villefort .
“ Oh , ” said Monte Cristo , “ I allow of no excuse .
On Saturday , at six o ’ clock .
I shall be expecting you , and if you fail to come , I shall think — for how do I know to the contrary ? — that this house , which has remained <unk> for twenty years , must have some gloomy <unk> or dreadful <unk> connected with it . ” “ I will come , count , — I will be sure to come , ” said Villefort eagerly .
“ Thank you , ” said Monte Cristo ; “ now you must permit me to take my leave of you . ” “ You said before that you were obliged to leave us , monsieur , ” said Madame de Villefort , “ and you were about to tell us why when your attention was called to some other subject . ” “ Indeed madame , ” said Monte Cristo : “ I scarcely know if I dare tell you where I am going . ” “ <unk> ; say on . ” “ Well , then , it is to see a thing on which I have sometimes <unk> for hours together . ” “ What is it ? ” “ A telegraph .
So now I have told my secret . ” “ A telegraph ? ” repeated Madame de Villefort .
“ Yes , a telegraph .
I had often seen one placed at the end of a road on a <unk> , and in the light of the sun its black arms , bending in every direction , always reminded me of the <unk> of an immense <unk> , and I assure you it was never without emotion that I gazed on it , for I could not help thinking how wonderful it was that these various signs should be made to <unk> the air with such <unk> as to convey to the distance of three hundred leagues the ideas and wishes of a man sitting at a table at one end of the line to another man <unk> placed at the opposite extremity , and all this effected by a simple act of <unk> on the part of the <unk> of the message .
I began to think of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , in short , of all the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , until I laughed aloud at the <unk> of my own imagination .
Now , it never occurred to me to wish for a nearer <unk> of these large <unk> , with their long black <unk> , for I always feared to find under their stone wings some little human genius <unk> to death with <unk> , <unk> , and government <unk> .
But one fine day I learned that the <unk> of this telegraph was only a poor wretch , hired for twelve hundred francs a year , and employed all day , not in <unk> the heavens like an <unk> , or in gazing on the water like an <unk> , or even in <unk> the privilege of observing the country around him , but all his <unk> life was passed in watching his <unk> , <unk> fellow <unk> , four or five leagues distant from him .
At length I felt a desire to study this living <unk> more closely , and to endeavor to understand the secret part played by these <unk> when they occupy themselves simply with <unk> different pieces of <unk> . ” <unk> “ And are you going there ? ” “ I am . ” “ What telegraph do you intend visiting ?
that of the home <unk> , or of the <unk> ? ” “ Oh , no ; I should find there people who would force me to understand things of which I would prefer to remain ignorant , and who would try to explain to me , in spite of myself , a mystery which even they do not understand .
_ Ma foi ! _ I should wish to keep my <unk> concerning <unk> <unk> ; it is quite enough to have those <unk> which I had formed of my <unk> .
I shall , therefore , not visit either of these <unk> , but one in the open country where I shall find a <unk> <unk> , who knows no more than the <unk> he is employed to work . ” “ You are a singular man , ” said Villefort .
“ What line would you advise me to study ? ” “ The one that is most in use just at this time . ” “ The Spanish one , you mean , I suppose ? ” “ Yes ; should you like a letter to the minister that they might explain to you — — ” “ No , ” said Monte Cristo ; “ since , as I told you before , I do not wish to comprehend it .
The moment I understand it there will no longer exist a telegraph for me ; it will be nothing more than a sign from M. <unk> , or from M. <unk> , <unk> to the prefect of <unk> , <unk> by two Greek words , _ <unk> _ , _ <unk> _ .
It is the <unk> with black <unk> , and the awful word which I wish to retain in my imagination in all its purity and all its importance . ” “ Go then ; for in the course of two hours it will be dark , and you will not be able to see anything . ” “ _ Ma foi ! _ you <unk> me .
Which is the nearest way ?
<unk> ? ” “ Yes ; the road to <unk> . ” “ And afterwards the road to <unk> ? ” “ Yes . ” “ By the tower of <unk> , you mean ? ” “ Yes . ” “ Thank you .
Good-bye .
On Saturday I will tell you my <unk> concerning the telegraph . ” At the door the count was met by the two <unk> , who had just completed the act which was to <unk> Valentine , and who were leaving under the conviction of having done a thing which could not fail of <unk> <unk> to their credit .
Chapter <unk> .
How a <unk> May <unk> <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> His <unk> Not on the same night as he had stated , but the next morning , the Count of Monte Cristo went out by the Barrière d ’ <unk> , taking the road to <unk> .
<unk> the village of <unk> , without stopping at the telegraph , which <unk> its great <unk> arms as he passed , the count reached the tower of <unk> , situated , as everyone knows , upon the highest point of the plain of that name .
At the foot of the hill the count <unk> and began to ascend by a little <unk> path , about eighteen inches wide ; when he reached the summit he found himself stopped by a hedge , upon which green fruit had succeeded to red and white flowers .
Monte Cristo looked for the entrance to the enclosure , and was not long in finding a little wooden gate , working on <unk> hinges , and fastened with a nail and <unk> .
The count soon <unk> the <unk> , the gate opened , and he then found himself in a little garden , about twenty feet long by twelve wide , bounded on one side by part of the hedge , which contained the ingenious <unk> we have called a gate , and on the other by the old tower , covered with <unk> and <unk> with <unk> .
No one would have thought in looking at this old , <unk> , <unk> tower ( which might be <unk> to an elderly <unk> dressed up to receive her <unk> at a <unk> feast ) that it would have been capable of telling strange things , if , — in addition to the <unk> ears which the <unk> says all walls are provided with , — it had also a voice .
The garden was crossed by a path of red <unk> , <unk> by a <unk> of thick box , of many years ’ growth , and of a tone and color that would have delighted the heart of <unk> , our modern <unk> .
This path was formed in the shape of the figure of <unk> , thus , in its <unk> , making a walk of sixty feet in a garden of only twenty .
Never had <unk> , the fresh and smiling <unk> of <unk> , been <unk> with a <unk> or more <unk> <unk> than that which was paid to her in this little enclosure .
In fact , of the twenty <unk> which formed the _ <unk> _ , not one bore the mark of the <unk> , nor were there <unk> anywhere of the <unk> <unk> which is so <unk> to plants growing in a damp soil .
And yet it was not because the damp had been <unk> from the garden ; the earth , black as <unk> , the thick <unk> of the trees betrayed its presence ; besides , had natural <unk> been wanting , it could have been immediately supplied by <unk> means , thanks to a <unk> of water , sunk in one of the corners of the garden , and upon which were stationed a <unk> and a <unk> , who , from <unk> , no doubt , always remained on the two opposite sides of the basin .
There was not a <unk> of grass to be seen in the paths , or a <unk> in the <unk> ; no fine lady ever <unk> and <unk> her <unk> , her <unk> , and her <unk> , in her <unk> _ <unk> _ with more pains than this hitherto <unk> gardener bestowed upon his little enclosure .
Monte Cristo stopped after having closed the gate and fastened the <unk> to the nail , and cast a look around .
“ The man at the telegraph , ” said he , “ must either engage a gardener or <unk> himself <unk> to <unk> . ” Suddenly he struck against something <unk> behind a <unk> filled with leaves ; the something rose , uttering an exclamation of astonishment , and Monte Cristo found himself facing a man about fifty years old , who was <unk> <unk> , which he was placing upon <unk> leaves .
He had twelve leaves and about as many <unk> , which , on rising suddenly , he let fall from his hand .
“ You are <unk> your <unk> , sir ? ” said Monte Cristo , smiling .
<unk> “ Excuse me , sir , ” replied the man , raising his hand to his cap ; “ I am not up there , I know , but I have only just come down . ” “ Do not let me interfere with you in anything , my friend , ” said the count ; “ <unk> your <unk> , if , indeed , there are any left . ” “ I have ten left , ” said the man , “ for here are eleven , and I had <unk> , five more than last year .
But I am not surprised ; the spring has been warm this year , and <unk> require heat , sir .
This is the reason that , instead of the sixteen I had last year , I have this year , you see , eleven , already <unk> — twelve , <unk> , fourteen , fifteen , sixteen , seventeen , eighteen .
Ah , I miss three , they were here last night , sir — I am sure they were here — I counted them .
It must be the son of <unk> <unk> who has stolen them ; I saw him <unk> about here this morning .
Ah , the young rascal — <unk> in a garden — he does not know where that may lead him to . ” “ Certainly , it is wrong , ” said Monte Cristo , “ but you should take into consideration the youth and <unk> of the <unk> . ” “ Of course , ” said the gardener , “ but that does not make it the less unpleasant .
But , sir , once more I beg pardon ; perhaps you are an officer that I am <unk> here . ” And he glanced <unk> at the count ’ s blue coat .
<unk> “ <unk> yourself , my friend , ” said the count , with the smile which he made at will either terrible or benevolent , and which now expressed only the <unk> feeling ; “ I am not an inspector , but a traveller , brought here by a curiosity he half <unk> of , since he causes you to lose your time . ” “ Ah , my time is not valuable , ” replied the man with a melancholy smile .
“ Still it belongs to government , and I ought not to waste it ; but , having received the signal that I might rest for an hour ” ( here he glanced at the <unk> , for there was everything in the enclosure of <unk> , even a <unk> ) , “ and having ten minutes before me , and my <unk> being <unk> , when a day longer — <unk> , sir , do you think <unk> eat them ? ” “ Indeed , I should think not , ” replied Monte Cristo ; “ <unk> are bad neighbors for us who do not eat them preserved , as the <unk> did . ” “ What ?
Did the <unk> eat them ? ” said the gardener — “ ate <unk> ? ” “ I have read so in <unk> , ” said the count .
“ Really ?
They can ’ t be nice , though they do say ‘ as fat as a <unk> . ’ It is not a wonder they are fat , sleeping all day , and only waking to eat all night .
Listen .
Last year I had four <unk> — they stole one , I had one <unk> , only one — well , sir , they ate half of it on the wall ; a splendid <unk> — I never ate a better . ” “ You ate it ? ” “ That is to say , the half that was left — you understand ; it was exquisite , sir .
Ah , those gentlemen never choose the worst <unk> ; like <unk> <unk> ’ s son , who has not chosen the worst <unk> .
But this year , ” continued the <unk> , “ I ’ ll take care it shall not happen , even if I should be forced to sit by the whole night to watch when the <unk> are <unk> . ” Monte Cristo had seen enough .
Every man has a <unk> passion in his heart , as every fruit has its <unk> ; that of the telegraph man was <unk> .
He began <unk> the <unk> which <unk> the sun from the <unk> , and won the heart of the gardener .
“ Did you come here , sir , to see the telegraph ? ” he said .
“ Yes , if it <unk> ’ t contrary to the <unk> . ” “ Oh , no , ” said the gardener ; “ not in the least , since there is no danger that anyone can possibly understand what we are saying . ” “ I have been told , ” said the count , “ that you do not always yourselves understand the <unk> you repeat . ” “ That is true , sir , and that is what I like best , ” said the man , smiling .
“ Why do you like that best ? ” “ Because then I have no <unk> .
I am a <unk> then , and nothing else , and so long as I work , nothing more is required of me . ” “ Is it possible , ” said Monte Cristo to himself , “ that I can have met with a man that has no ambition ?
That would <unk> my plans . ” “ Sir , ” said the gardener , glancing at the <unk> , “ the ten minutes are almost up ; I must return to my post .
Will you go up with me ? ” “ I follow you . ” Monte Cristo entered the tower , which was divided into three stories .
The tower contained <unk> , such as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , hung against the wall ; this was all the furniture .
The second was the man ’ s <unk> abode , or rather <unk> ; it contained a few poor <unk> of household furniture — a bed , a table , two chairs , a stone <unk> — and some dry <unk> , hung up to the ceiling , which the count recognized as sweet <unk> , and of which the good man was <unk> the <unk> ; he had <unk> them with as much care as if he had been master <unk> in the <unk> des <unk> .
“ Does it require much study to learn the art of <unk> ? ” asked Monte Cristo .
“ The study does not take long ; it was acting as a <unk> that was so <unk> . ” “ And what is the pay ? ” “ A thousand francs , sir . ” “ It is nothing . ” “ No ; but then we are <unk> , as you perceive . ” Monte Cristo looked at the room .
They passed to the third story ; it was the telegraph room .
Monte Cristo looked in turn at the two iron <unk> by which the <unk> was worked .
“ It is very interesting , ” he said , “ but it must be very <unk> for a <unk> . ” “ Yes .
At first my neck was <unk> with looking at it , but at the end of a year I became used to it ; and then we have our hours of <unk> , and our <unk> . ” “ <unk> ? ” “ Yes . ” “ When ? ” “ When we have a fog . ” “ Ah , to be sure . ” “ Those are indeed <unk> to me ; I go into the garden , I <unk> , I <unk> , I <unk> , I kill the <unk> all day long . ” “ How long have you been here ? ” “ Ten years , and five as a <unk> make fifteen . ” “ You are — — ” “ <unk> years old . ” “ How long must you have served to claim the <unk> ? ” “ Oh , sir , twenty-five years . ” “ And how much is the <unk> ? ” “ A hundred crowns . ” “ Poor humanity ! ” murmured Monte Cristo .
“ What did you say , sir ? ” asked the man .
“ I was saying it was very interesting . ” “ What was ? ” “ All you were showing me .
And you really understand none of these <unk> ? ” “ None at all . ” “ And have you never tried to understand them ? ” “ Never .
Why should I ? ” “ But still there are some <unk> only addressed to you . ” “ Certainly . ” “ And do you understand them ? ” “ They are always the same . ” “ And they mean — — ” “ ‘ _ Nothing new ; You have an hour ; _ ’ or ‘ _ <unk> _ . ’ ” “ This is simple enough , ” said the count ; “ but look , is not your correspondent putting itself in motion ? ” “ Ah , yes ; thank you , sir . ” “ And what is it saying — anything you understand ? ” “ Yes ; it <unk> if I am ready . ” “ And you reply ? ” “ By the same sign , which , at the same time , tells my <unk> correspondent that I am ready , while it gives notice to my <unk> correspondent to prepare in his turn . ” “ It is very ingenious , ” said the count .
“ You will see , ” said the man <unk> ; “ in five minutes he will speak . ” “ I have , then , five minutes , ” said Monte Cristo to himself ; “ it is more time than I require .
My dear sir , will you allow me to ask you a question ? ” “ What is it , sir ? ” “ You are fond of <unk> ? ” “ <unk> . ” “ And you would be pleased to have , instead of this <unk> of twenty feet , an enclosure of two <unk> ? ” “ Sir , I should make a <unk> paradise of it . ” “ You live badly on your thousand francs ? ” “ <unk> enough ; but yet I do live . ” “ Yes ; but you have a <unk> small garden . ” “ True , the garden is not large . ” “ And , then , such as it is , it is filled with <unk> , who eat everything . ” “ Ah , they are my <unk> . ” “ Tell me , should you have the misfortune to turn your head while your <unk> correspondent was <unk> — — ” “ I should not see him . ” “ Then what would happen ? ” “ I could not repeat the <unk> . ” “ And then ? ” “ Not having repeated them , through <unk> , I should be <unk> . ” “ How much ? ” “ A hundred francs . ” “ The <unk> of your income — that would be fine work . ” “ Ah ! ” said the man .
“ Has it ever happened to you ? ” said Monte Cristo .
“ Once , sir , when I was <unk> a <unk> . ” “ Well , suppose you were to alter a signal , and <unk> another ? ” “ Ah , that is another case ; I should be turned off , and lose my <unk> . ” “ Three hundred francs ? ” “ A hundred crowns , yes , sir ; so you see that I am not likely to do any of these things . ” “ Not even for fifteen years ’ <unk> ?
Come , it is worth thinking about ? ” “ For fifteen thousand francs ? ” “ Yes . ” “ Sir , you alarm me . ” “ <unk> . ” “ Sir , you are <unk> me ? ” “ Just so ; fifteen thousand francs , do you understand ? ” “ Sir , let me see my <unk> correspondent . ” “ On the contrary , do not look at him , but at this . ” “ What is it ? ” “ What ?
Do you not know these <unk> of paper ? ” “ <unk> ! ” “ Exactly ; there are fifteen of them . ” “ And whose are they ? ” “ <unk> , if you like . ” “ <unk> ? ” exclaimed the man , <unk> .
“ Yes ; yours — your own property . ” “ Sir , my <unk> correspondent is <unk> . ” “ Let him signal . ” “ Sir , you have <unk> me ; I shall be <unk> . ” “ That will cost you a hundred francs ; you see it is your interest to take my bank-notes . ” “ Sir , my <unk> correspondent <unk> his <unk> ; he is impatient . ” “ Never mind — take these ; ” and the count placed the packet in the man ’ s hands .
“ Now this is not all , ” he said ; “ you cannot live upon your fifteen thousand francs . ” “ I shall still have my place . ” “ No , you will lose it , for you are going to alter your correspondent ’ s message . ” “ Oh , sir , what are you <unk> ? ” “ A jest . ” “ Sir , unless you force me — — ” “ I think I can <unk> force you ; ” and Monte Cristo drew another packet from his pocket .
“ Here are ten thousand more francs , ” he said , “ with the fifteen thousand already in your pocket , they will make twenty-five thousand .
With five thousand you can buy a pretty little house with two <unk> of land ; the remaining twenty thousand will bring you in a thousand francs a year . ” “ A garden with two <unk> of land ! ” “ And a thousand francs a year . ” “ Oh , heavens ! ” “ Come , take them , ” and Monte Cristo forced the bank-notes into his hand .
“ What am I to do ? ” “ Nothing very difficult . ” “ But what is it ? ” “ To repeat these signs . ” Monte Cristo took a paper from his pocket , upon which were drawn three signs , with numbers to indicate the order in which they were to be worked .
“ There , you see it will not take long . ” “ Yes ; but — — ” “ Do this , and you will have <unk> and all the rest . ” The shot told ; red with fever , while the large drops fell from his brow , the man executed , one after the other , the three signs given by the count , in spite of the frightful <unk> of the <unk> correspondent , who , not understanding the change , began to think the gardener had gone mad .
As to the <unk> one , he <unk> repeated the same <unk> , which were finally <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> .
“ Now you are rich , ” said Monte Cristo .
“ Yes , ” replied the man , “ but at what a price ! ” “ Listen , friend , ” said Monte Cristo .
“ I do not wish to cause you any remorse ; believe me , then , when I swear to you that you have <unk> no man , but on the contrary have <unk> mankind . ” The man looked at the bank-notes , felt them , counted them , turned pale , then red , then rushed into his room to drink a glass of water , but he had no time to reach the <unk> , and fainted in the midst of his dried <unk> .
Five minutes after the new <unk> reached the minister , Debray had the horses put to his carriage , and drove to Danglars ’ house .
“ Has your husband any Spanish bonds ? ” he asked of the baroness .
“ I think so , indeed !
He has six millions ’ worth . ” “ He must sell them at whatever price . ” “ Why ? ” “ Because Don <unk> has fled from <unk> , and has returned to Spain . ” <unk> “ How do you know ? ” Debray shrugged his shoulders .
“ The idea of asking how I hear the news , ” he said .
The baroness did not wait for a <unk> ; she ran to her husband , who immediately hastened to his agent , and ordered him to sell at any price .
When it was seen that Danglars sold , the Spanish <unk> fell directly .
Danglars lost five hundred thousand francs ; but he rid himself of all his Spanish <unk> .
The same evening the following was read in _ Le <unk> _ : “ &#91; By telegraph . &#93;
The king , Don <unk> , has escaped the <unk> of his <unk> at <unk> , and has returned to Spain by the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> has risen in his favor . ” All that evening nothing was spoken of but the <unk> of Danglars , who had sold his <unk> , and of the luck of the <unk> , who only lost five hundred thousand francs by such a blow .
Those who had kept their <unk> , or bought those of Danglars , looked upon themselves as ruined , and passed a very bad night .
<unk> morning _ Le <unk> _ contained the following : “ It was without any foundation that _ Le <unk> _ yesterday announced the flight of Don <unk> and the revolt of <unk> .
The king ( Don <unk> ) has not left <unk> , and the <unk> is in the enjoyment of profound peace .
A <unk> signal , <unk> <unk> , owing to the fog , was the cause of this error . ” The <unk> rose one per <unk> higher than before they had fallen .
This , <unk> his loss , and what he had missed <unk> , made the difference of a million to Danglars .
“ Good , ” said Monte Cristo to Morrel , who was at his house when the news arrived of the strange <unk> of fortune of which Danglars had been the victim , “ I have just made a discovery for twenty-five thousand francs , for which I would have paid a hundred thousand . ” “ What have you discovered ? ” asked Morrel .
“ I have just discovered how a gardener may get rid of the <unk> that eat his <unk> . ” Chapter <unk> .
<unk> At first sight , the <unk> of the house at Auteuil gave no <unk> of splendor , nothing one would expect from the destined residence of the magnificent Count of Monte Cristo ; but this simplicity was according to the will of its master , who positively ordered nothing to be altered outside .
The splendor was within .
Indeed , almost before the door opened , the scene changed .
M. Bertuccio had <unk> himself in the taste displayed in <unk> , and in the rapidity with which it was executed .
It is told that the Duc d ’ <unk> removed in a single night a whole <unk> of trees that <unk> Louis <unk> .
; in three days M. Bertuccio planted an entirely bare court with <unk> , large <unk> <unk> to shade the different parts of the house , and in the <unk> , instead of the usual paving-stones , half hidden by the grass , there extended a lawn but that morning laid down , and upon which the water was yet <unk> .
For the rest , the orders had been <unk> by the count ; he himself had given a plan to Bertuccio , <unk> the spot where each tree was to be planted , and the shape and extent of the lawn which was to take the place of the paving-stones .
Thus the house had become <unk> , and Bertuccio himself declared that he scarcely knew it , <unk> as it was by a <unk> of trees .
The <unk> would not have <unk> , while he was about it , to have made some <unk> in the garden , but the count had positively forbidden it to be touched .
Bertuccio made <unk> , however , by <unk> the <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> with flowers .
What , above all , manifested the <unk> of the steward , and the profound science of the master , the one in carrying out the ideas of the other , was that this house which appeared only the night before so sad and gloomy , <unk> with that <unk> smell one can almost fancy to be the smell of time , had in a single day acquired the aspect of life , was <unk> with its master ’ s favorite <unk> , and had the very light <unk> according to his wish .
When the count arrived , he had under his touch his books and arms , his eyes rested upon his favorite <unk> ; his dogs , whose <unk> he loved , welcomed him in the antechamber ; the birds , whose songs delighted him , <unk> him with their music ; and the house , awakened from its long sleep , like the sleeping beauty in the wood , lived , sang , and <unk> like the houses we have long cherished , and in which , when we are forced to leave them , we leave a part of our souls .
The servants passed <unk> along the fine courtyard ; some , belonging to the <unk> , <unk> down the stairs , restored but the previous day , as if they had always inhabited the house ; others <unk> the <unk> , where the <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , appeared to have been <unk> for the last fifty years ; and in the <unk> the horses replied with <unk> to the <unk> , who spoke to them with much more respect than many servants pay their masters .
The library was divided into two parts on either side of the wall , and contained <unk> of two thousand <unk> ; one division was entirely devoted to <unk> , and even the volume which had been <unk> but the day before was to be seen in its place in all the dignity of its red and gold <unk> .
On the other side of the house , to match with the library , was the <unk> , ornamented with rare flowers , that <unk> in <unk> <unk> ; and in the midst of the <unk> , marvellous <unk> to sight and smell , was a <unk> which looked as if it had been abandoned during the past hour by <unk> who had left the balls on the cloth .
One chamber alone had been respected by the magnificent Bertuccio .
Before this room , to which you could ascend by the grand , and go out by the back staircase , the servants passed with curiosity , and Bertuccio with terror .
At five o ’ clock precisely , the count arrived before the house at Auteuil , followed by Ali .
Bertuccio was awaiting this arrival with impatience , mingled with uneasiness ; he hoped for some compliments , while , at the same time , he feared to have <unk> .
Monte Cristo descended into the courtyard , walked all over the house , without giving any sign of approbation or pleasure , until he entered his bedroom , situated on the opposite side to the closed room ; then he approached a little piece of furniture , made of <unk> , which he had noticed at a previous visit .
“ That can only be to hold gloves , ” he said .
“ Will your excellency <unk> to open it ? ” said the delighted Bertuccio , “ and you will find gloves in it . ” <unk> the count found everything he required — <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> “ Good , ” he said ; and M. Bertuccio left <unk> , so great , so powerful , and real was the influence exercised by this man over all who surrounded him .
At precisely six o ’ clock the <unk> of horses ’ <unk> was heard at the entrance door ; it was our captain of <unk> , who had arrived on <unk> .
“ I am sure I am the first , ” cried Morrel ; “ I did it on purpose to have you a minute to myself , before everyone came .
Julie and Emmanuel have a thousand things to tell you .
Ah , really this is magnificent !
But tell me , count , will your people take care of my horse ? ” “ Do not alarm yourself , my dear Maximilian — they understand . ” “ I mean , because he wants <unk> .
If you had seen at what a pace he came — like the wind ! ” “ I should think so , — a horse that cost <unk> francs ! ” said Monte Cristo , in the tone which a father would use towards a son .
“ Do you regret them ? ” asked Morrel , with his open laugh .
“ I ?
Certainly not , ” replied the count .
“ No ; I should only regret if the horse had not proved good . ” “ It is so good , that I have <unk> M. de Château-Renaud , one of the best <unk> in France , and M. Debray , who both <unk> the minister ’ s <unk> ; and close on their heels are the horses of Madame Danglars , who always go at six leagues an hour . ” “ Then they follow you ? ” asked Monte Cristo .
“ See , they are here . ” And at the same minute a carriage with smoking horses , accompanied by two mounted gentlemen , arrived at the gate , which opened before them .
The carriage drove round , and stopped at the steps , followed by the <unk> .
The instant Debray had touched the ground , he was at the <unk> .
He offered his hand to the baroness , who , descending , took it with a peculiarity of manner imperceptible to everyone but Monte Cristo .
But nothing escaped the count ’ s notice , and he observed a little note , passed with the <unk> that <unk> frequent practice , from the hand of Madame Danglars to that of the minister ’ s secretary .
After his wife the banker descended , as pale as though he had <unk> from his tomb instead of his carriage .
Madame Danglars threw a rapid and <unk> glance which could only be <unk> by Monte Cristo , around the courtyard , over the <unk> , and across the front of the house , then , <unk> a slight emotion , which must have been seen on her countenance if she had not kept her color , she ascended the steps , saying to Morrel : “ Sir , if you were a friend of mine , I should ask you if you would sell your horse . ” Morrel smiled with an expression very like a <unk> , and then turned round to Monte Cristo , as if to ask him to <unk> him from his embarrassment .
The count understood him .
“ Ah , madame , ” he said , “ why did you not make that request of me ? ” “ With you , sir , ” replied the baroness , “ one can wish for nothing , one is so sure to obtain it .
If it were so with M. Morrel — — ” “ <unk> , ” replied the count , “ I am witness that M. Morrel cannot give up his horse , his honor being engaged in keeping it . ” “ How so ? ” “ He laid a <unk> he would <unk> <unk> in the space of six months .
You understand now that if he were to get rid of the animal before the time named , he would not only lose his <unk> , but people would say he was afraid ; and a brave captain of <unk> cannot risk this , even to <unk> a pretty woman , which is , in my opinion , one of the most sacred <unk> in the world . ” “ You see my position , madame , ” said Morrel , <unk> a grateful smile on Monte Cristo .
“ It seems to me , ” said Danglars , in his coarse tone , <unk> by a forced smile , “ that you have already got horses enough . ” Madame Danglars seldom allowed remarks of this kind to pass <unk> , but , to the surprise of the young people , she pretended not to hear it , and said nothing .
Monte Cristo smiled at her unusual <unk> , and showed her two immense <unk> <unk> , over which wound <unk> plants , of a size and delicacy that nature alone could produce .
The baroness was astonished .
“ Why , ” said she , “ you could <unk> one of the <unk> in the Tuileries inside !
How can such enormous <unk> have been <unk> ? ” “ Ah !
madame , ” replied Monte Cristo , “ you must not ask of us , the <unk> of fine <unk> , such a question .
It is the work of another age , constructed by the <unk> of earth and water . ” “ How so ? — at what period can that have been ? ” “ I do not know ; I have only heard that an emperor of <unk> had an <unk> built <unk> , and that in this <unk> twelve <unk> like this were <unk> <unk> .
Two broke , from the heat of the fire ; the other ten were sunk three hundred <unk> deep into the sea .
The sea , knowing what was required of her , threw over them her <unk> , <unk> them with <unk> , and <unk> them with <unk> ; the whole was <unk> by two hundred years beneath these almost <unk> depths , for a revolution carried away the emperor who wished to make the trial , and only left the documents <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> and their descent into the sea .
At the end of two hundred years the documents were found , and they thought of bringing up the <unk> .
<unk> descended in <unk> , made <unk> on the discovery , into the <unk> where they were thrown ; but of ten three only remained , the rest having been broken by the waves .
I am fond of these <unk> , upon which , perhaps , <unk> , frightful <unk> have fixed their cold , dull eyes , and in which <unk> of small fish have slept , seeking a refuge from the pursuit of their enemies . ” Meanwhile , Danglars , who had cared little for <unk> , was mechanically tearing off the <unk> of a splendid <unk> , one after another .
When he had finished with the <unk> , he began at the <unk> ; but this , not being so easily <unk> as the <unk> , <unk> him dreadfully .
He shuddered , and <unk> his eyes as though <unk> from a dream .
“ Sir , ” said Monte Cristo to him , “ I do not recommend my <unk> to you , who possess such splendid <unk> ; but , nevertheless , here are two by <unk> , a <unk> <unk> , a <unk> , two by <unk> <unk> , a <unk> , a Van <unk> , a <unk> , and two or three by <unk> , worth looking at . ” “ Stay , ” said Debray ; “ I recognize this <unk> . ” “ Ah , indeed ! ” “ Yes ; it was proposed for the <unk> . ” “ Which , I believe , does not contain one ? ” said Monte Cristo .
“ No ; and yet they refused to buy it . ” “ Why ? ” said Château-Renaud .
“ You pretend not to know , — because government was not rich enough . ” “ Ah , pardon me , ” said Château-Renaud ; “ I have heard of these things every day during the last eight years , and I cannot understand them yet . ” “ You will , by and by , ” said Debray .
“ I think not , ” replied Château-Renaud .
“ <unk> <unk> Cavalcanti and Count Andrea Cavalcanti , ” announced Baptistin .
A black satin stock , fresh from the <unk> ’ s hands , gray <unk> , a bold eye , a major ’ s uniform , ornamented with three <unk> and five <unk> — in fact , the thorough bearing of an old soldier — such was the appearance of <unk> <unk> Cavalcanti , that tender father with whom we are already acquainted .
<unk> to him , dressed in entirely new clothes , advanced <unk> Count Andrea Cavalcanti , the <unk> son , whom we also know .
The three young people were talking together .
On the entrance of the <unk> , their eyes glanced from father to son , and then , naturally enough , rested on the latter , whom they began <unk> .
“ Cavalcanti ! ” said Debray .
“ A fine name , ” said Morrel .
“ Yes , ” said Château-Renaud , “ these <unk> are well named and badly dressed . ” “ You are <unk> , Château-Renaud , ” replied Debray ; “ those clothes are well cut and quite new . ” “ That is just what I find fault with .
That gentleman appears to be well dressed for the first time in his life . ” “ Who are those gentlemen ? ” asked Danglars of Monte Cristo .
“ You heard — Cavalcanti . ” “ That tells me their name , and nothing else . ” “ Ah !
true .
You do not know the Italian nobility ; the Cavalcanti are all descended from <unk> . ” “ Have they any fortune ? ” “ An enormous one . ” “ What do they do ? ” “ <unk> to spend it all .
They have some business with you , I think , from what they told me the day before yesterday .
I , indeed , invited them here today on your account .
I will introduce you to them . ” “ But they appear to speak French with a very pure accent , ” said Danglars .
“ The son has been <unk> in a <unk> in the south ; I believe near Marseilles .
You will find him quite enthusiastic . ” “ Upon what subject ? ” asked Madame Danglars .
“ The French ladies , madame .
He has made up his mind to take a wife from Paris . ” “ A fine idea that of his , ” said Danglars , <unk> his shoulders .
Madame Danglars looked at her husband with an expression which , at any other time , would have indicated a storm , but for the second time she <unk> herself .
“ The baron appears thoughtful today , ” said Monte Cristo to her ; “ are they going to put him in the <unk> ? ” “ Not yet , I think .
More likely he has been <unk> on the <unk> , and has lost money . ” “ M.
and Madame de Villefort , ” cried Baptistin .
They entered .
M. de Villefort , notwithstanding his <unk> , was <unk> affected , and when Monte Cristo touched his hand , he felt it tremble .
“ Certainly , women alone know how to <unk> , ” said Monte Cristo to himself , glancing at Madame Danglars , who was smiling on the procureur , and <unk> his wife .
After a short time , the count saw Bertuccio , who , until then , had been occupied on the other side of the house , <unk> into an adjoining room .
He went to him .
“ What do you want , M. Bertuccio ? ” said he .
“ Your excellency has not stated the number of guests . ” “ Ah , true . ” “ How many <unk> ? ” “ Count for yourself . ” “ Is everyone here , your excellency ? ” “ Yes . ” Bertuccio glanced through the door , which was <unk> .
The count watched him .
“ Good heavens ! ” he exclaimed .
“ What is the matter ? ” said the count .
“ That woman — that woman ! ” “ Which ? ” “ The one with a white dress and so many diamonds — the fair one . ” “ Madame Danglars ? ” “ I do not know her name ; but it is she , sir , it is she ! ” “ <unk> do you mean ? ” “ The woman of the garden ! — she that was _ <unk> _ — she who was walking while she waited for — — ” Bertuccio stood at the open door , with his eyes starting and his hair on end .
“ <unk> for whom ? ” Bertuccio , without answering , pointed to Villefort with something of the gesture <unk> <unk> to point out <unk> .
“ Oh , oh ! ” he at length muttered , “ do you see ? ” “ What ?
Who ? ” “ <unk> ! ” “ <unk> ! — M.
de Villefort , the king ’ s attorney ?
Certainly I see him . ” “ Then I did not kill him ? ” “ Really , I think you are going mad , good Bertuccio , ” said the count .
“ Then he is not dead ? ” <unk> “ No ; you see plainly he is not dead .
<unk> of striking between the <unk> and <unk> left <unk> , as your <unk> do , you must have struck higher or lower , and life is very <unk> in these <unk> , or rather there is no truth in anything you have told me — it was a fright of the imagination , a dream of your fancy .
You went to sleep full of thoughts of vengeance ; they weighed heavily upon your stomach ; you had the <unk> — that ’ s all .
Come , calm yourself , and <unk> them up — M.
and Madame de Villefort , two ; M. and Madame Danglars , four ; M. de Château-Renaud , M. Debray , M. Morrel , seven ; <unk> <unk> Cavalcanti , eight . ” “ <unk> ! ” repeated Bertuccio .
“ Stop !
You are in a <unk> hurry to be off — you forget one of my guests .
<unk> a little to the left .
Stay !
look at M. Andrea Cavalcanti , the young man in a black coat , looking at <unk> ’ s ‘ <unk> ’ ; now he is turning . ” This time Bertuccio would have uttered an exclamation , had not a look from Monte Cristo <unk> him .
“ Benedetto ? ” he muttered ; “ fatality ! ” “ <unk> six o ’ clock has just struck , M. Bertuccio , ” said the count <unk> ; “ I ordered dinner at that hour , and I do not like to wait ; ” and he returned to his guests , while Bertuccio , leaning against the wall , succeeded in reaching the dining-room .
Five minutes afterwards the doors of the drawing-room were thrown open , and Bertuccio appearing said , with a violent effort , “ The dinner <unk> . ” The Count of Monte Cristo offered his arm to Madame de Villefort .
“ M.
de Villefort , ” he said , “ will you conduct the <unk> Danglars ? ” Villefort <unk> , and they passed on to the dining-room .
Chapter <unk> .
The <unk> It was evident that one sentiment affected all the guests on entering the dining-room .
Each one asked what strange influence had brought them to this house , and yet astonished , even uneasy though they were , they still felt that they would not like to be absent .
The recent events , the solitary and eccentric position of the count , his enormous , nay , almost incredible fortune , should have made men <unk> , and have altogether prevented ladies visiting a house where there was no one of their own sex to receive them ; and yet curiosity had been enough to lead them to <unk> the bounds of prudence and <unk> .
And all present , even including Cavalcanti and his son , notwithstanding the <unk> of the one and the <unk> of the other , were thoughtful , on finding themselves assembled at the house of this <unk> man .
Madame Danglars had started when Villefort , on the count ’ s invitation , offered his arm ; and Villefort felt that his glance was uneasy beneath his gold spectacles , when he felt the arm of the baroness press upon his own .
None of this had escaped the count , and even by this mere contact of <unk> the scene had already acquired considerable interest for an <unk> .
M. de Villefort had on the right hand Madame Danglars , on his left Morrel .
The count was seated between Madame de Villefort and Danglars ; the other <unk> were filled by Debray , who was placed between the two Cavalcanti , and by Château-Renaud , seated between Madame de Villefort and Morrel .
The <unk> was magnificent ; Monte Cristo had endeavored completely to <unk> the Parisian ideas , and to <unk> the curiosity as much as the appetite of his guests .
It was an <unk> feast that he offered to them , but of such a kind as the Arabian <unk> might be supposed to prepare .
Every <unk> fruit that the four quarters of the <unk> could provide was <unk> in <unk> from <unk> and <unk> from <unk> .
<unk> birds , <unk> their most brilliant <unk> , enormous fish , spread upon <unk> silver <unk> , together with every wine produced in the <unk> , <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> , sparkling in bottles , whose <unk> shape seemed to give an additional <unk> to the draught , — all these , like one of the <unk> with which <unk> of old gratified his guests , passed in <unk> before the eyes of the astonished <unk> , who understood that it was possible to <unk> a thousand louis upon a dinner for ten persons , but only on the condition of eating pearls , like <unk> , or drinking <unk> gold , like <unk> de ’ <unk> .
Monte Cristo noticed the general astonishment , and began laughing and <unk> about it .
“ Gentlemen , ” he said , “ you will admit that , when arrived at a certain degree of fortune , the <unk> of life are all that can be desired ; and the ladies will allow that , after having risen to a certain <unk> of position , the ideal alone can be more <unk> .
Now , to follow out this reasoning , what is the marvellous ? — that which we do not understand .
What is it that we really desire ? — that which we cannot obtain .
Now , to see things which I cannot understand , to procure <unk> , these are the study of my life .
I <unk> my wishes by two means — my will and my money .
I take as much interest in the pursuit of some <unk> as you do , M. Danglars , in <unk> a new <unk> line ; you , M. de Villefort , in <unk> a <unk> to death ; you , M. Debray , in <unk> a <unk> ; you , M. de Château-Renaud , in pleasing a woman ; and you , Morrel , in breaking a horse that no one can ride .
For example , you see these two fish ; one brought from fifty leagues beyond St. <unk> , the other five leagues from Naples .
Is it not amusing to see them both on the same table ? ” “ What are the two fish ? ” asked Danglars .
“ M.
Château-Renaud , who has lived in <unk> , will tell you the name of one , and <unk> Cavalcanti , who is an Italian , will tell you the name of the other . ” “ This one is , I think , a <unk> , ” said Château-Renaud .
“ And that one , if I mistake not , a <unk> . ” “ Just so .
Now , M. Danglars , ask these gentlemen where they are caught . ” “ <unk> , ” said Château-Renaud , “ are only found in the <unk> . ” “ And , ” said Cavalcanti , “ I know that <unk> <unk> alone <unk> <unk> of that size . ” “ Exactly ; one comes from the <unk> , and the other from <unk> <unk> . ” “ Impossible ! ” cried all the guests <unk> .
“ Well , this is just what <unk> me , ” said Monte Cristo .
“ I am like <unk> — _ <unk> <unk> _ ; and that is what is amusing you at this moment .
This fish , which seems so exquisite to you , is very likely no better than <unk> or <unk> ; but it seemed impossible to procure it , and here it is . ” “ But how could you have these fish brought to France ? ” “ Oh , nothing more easy .
Each fish was brought over in a <unk> — one filled with river <unk> and <unk> , the other with <unk> and lake plants ; they were placed in a <unk> built on purpose , and thus the <unk> lived twelve days , the <unk> eight , and both were alive when my <unk> seized them , <unk> one with milk and the other with wine .
You do not believe me , M. Danglars ! ” “ I cannot help <unk> , ” answered Danglars with his stupid smile .
“ Baptistin , ” said the count , “ have the other fish brought in — the <unk> and the <unk> which came in the other <unk> , and which are yet alive . ” Danglars opened his bewildered eyes ; the company <unk> their hands .
Four servants carried in two <unk> covered with <unk> plants , and in each of which was breathing a fish similar to those on the table .
“ But why have two of each sort ? ” asked Danglars .
“ <unk> because one might have died , ” <unk> answered Monte Cristo .
“ You are certainly an extraordinary man , ” said Danglars ; “ and philosophers may well say it is a fine thing to be rich . ” “ And to have ideas , ” added Madame Danglars .
“ Oh , do not give me credit for this , madame ; it was done by the <unk> , who much <unk> them , and <unk> <unk> that they sent <unk> from <unk> to Rome , who carried on their heads fish which he calls the _ <unk> _ , and which , from the description , must probably be the <unk> .
It was also considered a luxury to have them alive , it being an amusing sight to see them die , for , when dying , they change color three or four times , and like the <unk> when it <unk> , pass through all the <unk> shades , after which they were sent to the kitchen .
Their agony formed part of their merit — if they were not seen alive , they were <unk> when dead . ” “ Yes , ” said Debray , “ but then <unk> is only a few leagues from Rome . ” “ True , ” said Monte Cristo ; “ but what would be the use of living eighteen hundred years after <unk> , if we can do no better than he could ? ” The two Cavalcanti opened their enormous eyes , but had the good sense not to say anything .
“ All this is very extraordinary , ” said Château-Renaud ; “ still , what I admire the most , I confess , is the marvellous <unk> with which your orders are executed .
Is it not true that you only bought this house five or six days ago ? ” “ Certainly not longer . ” “ Well , I am sure it is quite <unk> since last week .
If I remember rightly , it had another entrance , and the courtyard was <unk> and empty ; while today we have a splendid lawn , bordered by trees which appear to be a hundred years old . ” “ Why not ?
I am fond of grass and shade , ” said Monte Cristo .
“ Yes , ” said Madame de Villefort , “ the door was towards the road before , and on the day of my <unk> escape you brought me into the house from the road , I remember . ” “ Yes , madame , ” said Monte Cristo ; “ but I preferred having an entrance which would allow me to see the <unk> de <unk> over my gate . ” “ In four days , ” said Morrel ; “ it is extraordinary ! ” “ Indeed , ” said Château-Renaud , “ it seems quite <unk> to make a new house out of an old one ; for it was very old , and dull too .
I recollect coming for my mother to look at it when M. de Saint-Méran <unk> it for <unk> two or three years ago . ” “ M.
de Saint-Méran ? ” said Madame de Villefort ; “ then this house belonged to M. de Saint-Méran before you bought it ? ” “ It appears so , ” replied Monte Cristo .
“ Is it possible that you do not know of whom you purchased it ? ” “ Quite so ; my steward <unk> all this business for me . ” “ It is certainly ten years since the house had been occupied , ” said Château-Renaud , “ and it was quite melancholy to look at it , with the <unk> closed , the doors locked , and the <unk> in the court .
Really , if the house had not belonged to the <unk> of the procureur , one might have thought it some <unk> place where a horrible crime had been committed . ” Villefort , who had hitherto not <unk> the three or four glasses of rare wine which were placed before him , here took one , and drank it off .
Monte Cristo allowed a short time to <unk> , and then said : “ It is singular , baron , but the same idea came across me the first time I came here ; it looked so gloomy I should never have bought it if my steward had not taken the matter into his own hands .
Perhaps the fellow had been <unk> by the notary . ” “ It is probable , ” stammered out Villefort , trying to smile ; “ but I can assure you that I had nothing to do with any such proceeding .
This house is part of Valentine ’ s <unk> , and M. de Saint-Méran wished to sell it ; for if it had remained another year or two <unk> it would have fallen to ruin . ” It was Morrel ’ s turn to become pale .
“ There was , above all , one room , ” continued Monte Cristo , “ very plain in appearance , hung with red damask , which , I know not why , appeared to me quite <unk> . ” “ Why so ? ” said Danglars ; “ why <unk> ? ” “ Can we account for instinct ? ” said Monte Cristo .
“ Are there not some places where we seem to breathe sadness ? — why , we cannot tell .
It is a chain of recollections — an idea which <unk> you back to other times , to other places — which , very likely , have no connection with the present time and place .
And there is something in this room which <unk> me <unk> of the chamber of the <unk> de <unk> or <unk> .
Stay , since we have finished dinner , I will show it to you , and then we will take coffee in the garden .
After dinner , the play . ” Monte Cristo looked <unk> at his guests .
Madame de Villefort rose , Monte Cristo did the same , and the rest followed their example .
Villefort and Madame Danglars remained for a moment , as if <unk> to their <unk> ; they questioned each other with vague and stupid glances .
“ Did you hear ? ” said Madame Danglars .
“ We must go , ” replied Villefort , offering his arm .
The others , attracted by curiosity , were already scattered in different parts of the house ; for they thought the visit would not be limited to the one room , and that , at the same time , they would obtain a view of the rest of the building , of which Monte Cristo had created a palace .
Each one went out by the open doors .
Monte Cristo waited for the two who remained ; then , when they had passed , he brought up the rear , and on his face was a smile , which , if they could have understood it , would have alarmed them much more than a visit to the room they were about to enter .
They began by walking through the apartments , many of which were fitted up in the <unk> style , with <unk> and <unk> instead of beds , and <unk> instead of furniture .
The <unk> were <unk> with the <unk> <unk> by the old masters , the <unk> hung with <unk> from <unk> , of <unk> colors , fantastic design , and wonderful <unk> .
At length they arrived at the famous room .
There was nothing particular about it , excepting that , although daylight had disappeared , it was not lighted , and everything in it was <unk> , while the rest of the rooms had been <unk> .
These two causes were enough to give it a gloomy aspect .
“ Oh . ” cried Madame de Villefort , “ it is really frightful . ” Madame Danglars tried to utter a few words , but was not heard .
Many <unk> were made , the <unk> of which was a <unk> opinion that there was something sinister about the room .
<unk> “ Is it not so ? ” asked Monte Cristo .
“ Look at that large <unk> bed , hung with such gloomy , <unk> <unk> !
And those two <unk> <unk> , that have <unk> from the <unk> ; do they not seem to say , with their pale lips and staring eyes , ‘ We have seen ’ ? ” Villefort became livid ; Madame Danglars fell into a long seat placed near the chimney .
“ Oh , ” said Madame de Villefort , smiling , “ are you <unk> enough to sit down upon the very seat perhaps upon which the crime was committed ? ” Madame Danglars rose suddenly .
“ And then , ” said Monte Cristo , “ this is not all . ” “ What is there more ? ” said Debray , who had not failed to notice the agitation of Madame Danglars .
“ Ah , what else is there ? ” said Danglars ; “ for , at present , I cannot say that I have seen anything extraordinary .
What do you say , M. Cavalcanti ? ” “ Ah , ” said he , “ we have at <unk> , <unk> ’ s tower ; at <unk> , <unk> ’ s prison ; at <unk> , the room of <unk> and <unk> . ” “ Yes , but you have not this little staircase , ” said Monte Cristo , opening a door concealed by the <unk> .
“ Look at it , and tell me what you think of it . ” “ What a <unk> , <unk> staircase , ” said Château-Renaud with a smile .
“ I do not know whether the wine of <unk> produces melancholy , but certainly everything appears to me black in this house , ” said Debray .
<unk> since Valentine ’ s <unk> had been mentioned , Morrel had been silent and sad .
“ Can you imagine , ” said Monte Cristo , “ some <unk> or Abbé de <unk> , one stormy , dark night , descending these stairs step by step , carrying a <unk> , which he wishes to hide from the sight of man , if not from God ? ” Madame Danglars half fainted on the arm of Villefort , who was obliged to support himself against the wall .
“ Ah , madame , ” cried Debray , “ what is the matter with you ?
how pale you look ! ” “ It is very evident what is the matter with her , ” said Madame de Villefort ; “ M.
de Monte Cristo is relating horrible stories to us , doubtless intending to <unk> us to death . ” “ Yes , ” said Villefort , “ really , count , you <unk> the ladies . ” “ What is the matter ? ” asked Debray , in a whisper , of Madame Danglars .
“ Nothing , ” she replied with a violent effort .
“ I want air , that is all . ” “ Will you come into the garden ? ” said Debray , advancing towards the back staircase .
“ No , no , ” she answered , “ I would rather remain here . ” “ Are you really frightened , madame ? ” said Monte Cristo .
“ Oh , no , sir , ” said Madame Danglars ; “ but you suppose scenes in a manner which gives them the appearance of reality . ” <unk> “ Ah , yes , ” said Monte Cristo smiling ; “ it is all a matter of imagination .
Why should we not imagine this the apartment of an honest mother ?
And this bed with red <unk> , a bed visited by the <unk> <unk> ?
And that mysterious staircase , the passage through which , not to disturb their sleep , the doctor and nurse pass , or even the father carrying the sleeping child ? ” Here Madame Danglars , instead of being <unk> by the soft picture , uttered a groan and fainted .
“ Madame Danglars is ill , ” said Villefort ; “ it would be better to take her to her carriage . ” “ Oh , _ <unk> Dieu ! _ ” said Monte Cristo , “ and I have forgotten my <unk> ! ” “ I have mine , ” said Madame de Villefort ; and she passed over to Monte Cristo a bottle full of the same kind of red <unk> whose good <unk> the count had <unk> on Edward .
“ Ah , ” said Monte Cristo , taking it from her hand .
“ Yes , ” she said , “ at your advice I have made the trial . ” “ And have you succeeded ? ” “ I think so . ” Madame Danglars was carried into the adjoining room ; Monte Cristo dropped a very small portion of the red <unk> upon her lips ; she returned to consciousness .
“ Ah , ” she cried , “ what a frightful dream ! ” Villefort pressed her hand to let her know it was not a dream .
They looked for M. Danglars , but , as he was not especially interested in <unk> ideas , he had gone into the garden , and was talking with <unk> Cavalcanti on the projected <unk> from Leghorn to <unk> .
Monte Cristo seemed in despair .
He took the arm of Madame Danglars , and conducted her into the garden , where they found Danglars taking coffee between the Cavalcanti .
“ Really , madame , ” he said , “ did I alarm you much ? ” “ Oh , no , sir , ” she answered ; “ but you know , things <unk> us differently , according to the <unk> of our minds . ” Villefort forced a laugh .
“ And then , you know , ” he said , “ an idea , a <unk> , is sufficient . ” “ Well , ” said Monte Cristo , “ you may believe me if you like , but it is my opinion that a crime has been committed in this house . ” “ Take care , ” said Madame de Villefort , “ the king ’ s attorney is here . ” “ Ah , ” replied Monte Cristo , “ since that is the case , I will take advantage of his presence to make my declaration . ” “ Your declaration ? ” said Villefort .
“ Yes , before witnesses . ” “ Oh , this is very interesting , ” said Debray ; “ if there really has been a crime , we will <unk> it . ” “ There has been a crime , ” said Monte Cristo .
“ Come this way , gentlemen ; come , M. Villefort , for a declaration to be available , should be made before the <unk> authorities . ” He then took Villefort ’ s arm , and , at the same time , holding that of Madame Danglars under his own , he dragged the procureur to the <unk> , where the shade was <unk> .
All the other guests followed .
“ Stay , ” said Monte Cristo , “ here , in this very spot ” ( and he stamped upon the ground ) , “ I had the earth dug up and fresh <unk> put in , to <unk> these old trees ; well , my man , <unk> , found a box , or rather , the <unk> of a box , in the midst of which was the <unk> of a <unk> born infant . ” <unk> Monte Cristo felt the arm of Madame Danglars <unk> , while that of Villefort trembled .
“ A <unk> born infant , ” repeated Debray ; “ this affair becomes serious ! ” “ Well , ” said Château-Renaud , “ I was not wrong just now then , when I said that houses had souls and faces like men , and that their <unk> carried the <unk> of their characters .
This house was gloomy because it was <unk> : it was <unk> because it concealed a crime . ” “ Who said it was a crime ? ” asked Villefort , with a last effort .
“ How ?
is it not a crime to <unk> a living child in a garden ? ” cried Monte Cristo .
“ And pray what do you call such an action ? ” “ But who said it was buried alive ? ” “ Why <unk> it there if it were dead ?
This garden has never been a cemetery . ” “ What is done to <unk> in this country ? ” asked <unk> Cavalcanti <unk> .
“ Oh , their heads are soon cut off , ” said Danglars .
“ Ah , indeed ? ” said Cavalcanti .
“ I think so ; am I not right , M. de Villefort ? ” asked Monte Cristo .
“ Yes , count , ” replied Villefort , in a voice now scarcely human .
Monte Cristo , seeing that the two persons for whom he had prepared this scene could scarcely endure it , and not wishing to carry it too far , said : “ Come , gentlemen , — some coffee , we seem to have forgotten it , ” and he conducted the guests back to the table on the lawn .
“ Indeed , count , ” said Madame Danglars , “ I am ashamed to own it , but all your frightful stories have so upset me , that I must beg you to let me sit down ; ” and she fell into a chair .
Monte Cristo bowed , and went to Madame de Villefort .
“ I think Madame Danglars again requires your bottle , ” he said .
But before Madame de Villefort could reach her friend , the procureur had found time to whisper to Madame Danglars , “ I must speak to you . ” “ When ? ” “ <unk> . ” “ Where ? ” “ In my office , or in the court , if you like , — that is the <unk> place . ” “ I will be there . ” At this moment Madame de Villefort approached .
“ Thanks , my dear friend , ” said Madame Danglars , trying to smile ; “ it is over now , and I am much better . ” Chapter <unk> .
The <unk> The evening passed on ; Madame de Villefort expressed a desire to return to Paris , which Madame Danglars had not dared to do , notwithstanding the uneasiness she experienced .
On his wife ’ s request , M. de Villefort was the first to give the signal of departure .
He offered a seat in his <unk> to Madame Danglars , that she might be under the care of his wife .
As for M. Danglars , absorbed in an interesting conversation with M. Cavalcanti , he paid no attention to anything that was passing .
While Monte Cristo had begged the <unk> of Madame de Villefort , he had noticed the approach of Villefort to Madame Danglars , and he soon guessed all that had passed between them , though the words had been uttered in so low a voice as hardly to be heard by Madame Danglars .
Without <unk> their arrangements , he allowed Morrel , Château-Renaud , and Debray to leave on horseback , and the ladies in M. de Villefort ’ s carriage .
Danglars , more and more delighted with <unk> Cavalcanti , had offered him a seat in his carriage .
Andrea Cavalcanti found his tilbury waiting at the door ; the <unk> , in every respect a <unk> of the English fashion , was standing on <unk> to hold a large <unk> horse .
Andrea had spoken very little during dinner ; he was an intelligent lad , and he feared to utter some <unk> before so many grand people , amongst whom , with <unk> eyes , he saw the king ’ s attorney .
Then he had been seized upon by Danglars , who , with a rapid glance at the <unk> old major and his modest son , and taking into consideration the hospitality of the count , made up his mind that he was in the society of some <unk> come to Paris to finish the <unk> education of his heir .
He contemplated with <unk> delight the large diamond which shone on the major ’ s little finger ; for the major , like a prudent man , in case of any accident <unk> to his bank-notes , had immediately converted them into an available <unk> .
Then , after dinner , on the pretext of business , he questioned the father and son upon their mode of living ; and the father and son , previously informed that it was through Danglars the one was to receive his <unk> francs and the other <unk> livres <unk> , were so full of <unk> that they would have shaken hands even with the banker ’ s servants , so much did their gratitude need an object to <unk> itself upon .
One thing above all the rest <unk> the respect , nay almost the <unk> , of Danglars for Cavalcanti .
The latter , faithful to the principle of <unk> , _ <unk> <unk> _ , had contented himself with showing his knowledge by <unk> in what lake the best <unk> were caught .
Then he had eaten some without saying a word more ; Danglars , therefore , concluded that such <unk> were common at the table of the illustrious <unk> of the Cavalcanti , who most likely in <unk> <unk> upon <unk> brought from <unk> , and <unk> sent from England , by the same means used by the count to bring the <unk> from <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> from the <unk> .
Thus it was with much politeness of manner that he heard Cavalcanti pronounce these words : “ <unk> , sir , I shall have the honor of waiting upon you on business . ” “ And I , sir , ” said Danglars , “ shall be most happy to receive you . ” Upon which he offered to take Cavalcanti in his carriage to the Hôtel des <unk> , if it would not be <unk> him of the company of his son .
To this Cavalcanti replied by saying that for some time past his son had lived <unk> of him , that he had his own horses and carriages , and that not having come together , it would not be difficult for them to leave <unk> .
The major seated himself , therefore , by the side of Danglars , who was more and more <unk> with the ideas of order and <unk> which <unk> this man , and yet who , being able to allow his son <unk> francs a year , might be supposed to possess a fortune of <unk> or <unk> livres .
As for Andrea , he began , by way of showing off , to <unk> his <unk> , who , instead of bringing the tilbury to the steps of the house , had taken it to the outer door , thus giving him the trouble of walking thirty steps to reach it .
The <unk> heard him with <unk> , took the bit of the impatient animal with his left hand , and with the right held out the <unk> to Andrea , who , taking them from him , rested his polished <unk> lightly on the step .
At that moment a hand touched his shoulder .
The young man turned round , thinking that Danglars or Monte Cristo had forgotten something they wished to tell him , and had returned just as they were starting .
But instead of either of these , he saw nothing but a strange face , <unk> , and <unk> by a beard , with eyes brilliant as <unk> , and a smile upon the mouth which displayed a perfect set of white teeth , pointed and sharp as the wolf ’ s or <unk> ’ s .
A red handkerchief <unk> his gray head ; torn and <unk> garments covered his large <unk> limbs , which seemed as though , like those of a <unk> , they would <unk> as he walked ; and the hand with which he leaned upon the young man ’ s shoulder , and which was the first thing Andrea saw , seemed of gigantic size .
<unk> Did the young man recognize that face by the light of the lantern in his tilbury , or was he merely struck with the horrible appearance of his <unk> ?
We cannot say ; but only relate the fact that he shuddered and stepped back suddenly .
“ What do you want of me ? ” he asked .
“ Pardon me , my friend , if I disturb you , ” said the man with the red handkerchief , “ but I want to speak to you . ” “ You have no right to beg at night , ” said the <unk> , endeavoring to rid his master of the troublesome <unk> .
“ I am not <unk> , my fine fellow , ” said the unknown to the servant , with so <unk> an expression of the eye , and so frightful a smile , that he withdrew ; “ I only wish to say two or three words to your master , who gave me a commission to <unk> about a fortnight ago . ” “ Come , ” said Andrea , with sufficient <unk> for his servant not to perceive his agitation , “ what do you want ?
Speak quickly , friend . ” The man said , in a low voice : “ I wish — I wish you to spare me the walk back to Paris .
I am very tired , and as I have not eaten so good a dinner as you , I can scarcely stand . ” The young man shuddered at this strange <unk> .
“ Tell me , ” he said — “ tell me what you want ? ” “ Well , then , I want you to take me up in your fine carriage , and carry me back . ” Andrea turned pale , but said nothing .
“ Yes , ” said the man , <unk> his hands into his pockets , and looking <unk> at the youth ; “ I have taken the <unk> into my head ; do you understand , Master Benedetto ? ” At this name , no doubt , the young man reflected a little , for he went towards his <unk> , saying : “ This man is right ; I did indeed charge him with a commission , the result of which he must tell me ; walk to the barrier , there take a cab , that you may not be too late . ” The surprised <unk> retired .
“ Let me at least reach a <unk> spot , ” said Andrea .
“ Oh , as for that , I ’ ll take you to a splendid place , ” said the man with the handkerchief ; and taking the horse ’ s bit he led the tilbury where it was certainly impossible for anyone to witness the honor that Andrea <unk> upon him .
“ Don ’ t think I want the glory of <unk> in your fine carriage , ” said he ; “ oh , no , it ’ s only because I am tired , and also because I have a little business to talk over with you . ” “ Come , step in , ” said the young man .
It was a pity this scene had not occurred in daylight , for it was curious to see this rascal throwing himself heavily down on the <unk> beside the young and elegant driver of the tilbury .
Andrea drove past the last house in the village without saying a word to his companion , who smiled <unk> , as though <unk> to find himself travelling in so comfortable a vehicle .
Once out of Auteuil , Andrea looked around , in order to assure himself that he could neither be seen nor heard , and then , stopping the horse and crossing his arms before the man , he asked : “ Now , tell me why you come to disturb my tranquillity ? ” “ Let me ask you why you deceived me ? ” “ How have I deceived you ? ” “ ‘ How , ’ do you ask ?
When we parted at the Pont du <unk> , you told me you were going to travel through <unk> and <unk> ; but instead of that , you come to Paris . ” “ How does that <unk> you ? ” “ It does not ; on the contrary , I think it will answer my purpose . ” “ So , ” said Andrea , “ you are <unk> upon me ? ” “ What fine words he <unk> ! ” “ I warn you , Master Caderousse , that you are mistaken . ” “ Well , well , don ’ t be angry , my boy ; you know well enough what it is to be unfortunate ; and misfortunes make us jealous .
I thought you were <unk> a living in <unk> or <unk> by acting as _ <unk> _ or _ <unk> _ , and I <unk> you sincerely , as I would a child of my own .
You know I always did call you my child . ” “ Come , come , what then ? ” “ <unk> — patience ! ” “ I am patient , but go on . ” “ All at once I see you pass through the barrier with a <unk> , a tilbury , and fine new clothes .
You must have discovered a mine , or else become a <unk> . ” “ So that , as you confess , you are jealous ? ” “ No , I am pleased — so pleased that I wished to congratulate you ; but as I am not quite properly dressed , I chose my opportunity , that I might not <unk> you . ” “ Yes , and a fine opportunity you have chosen ! ” exclaimed Andrea ; “ you speak to me before my servant . ” “ How can I help that , my boy ?
I speak to you when I can catch you .
You have a quick horse , a light tilbury , you are naturally as <unk> as an <unk> ; if I had missed you tonight , I might not have had another chance . ” “ You see , I do not conceal myself . ” “ You are lucky ; I wish I could say as much , for I do conceal myself ; and then I was afraid you would not recognize me , but you did , ” added Caderousse with his unpleasant smile .
“ It was very <unk> of you . ” “ Come , ” said Andrea , “ what do you want ? ” “ You do not speak <unk> to me , Benedetto , my old friend , that is not right — take care , or I may become troublesome . ” This <unk> <unk> the young man ’ s passion .
He urged the horse again into a <unk> .
“ You should not speak so to an old friend like me , Caderousse , as you said just now ; you are a native of Marseilles , I am — — ” “ Do you know then now what you are ? ” “ No , but I was brought up in Corsica ; you are old and <unk> , I am young and <unk> .
Between people like us <unk> are out of place , everything should be <unk> arranged .
Is it my fault if fortune , which has <unk> on you , has been kind to me ? ” “ <unk> has been kind to you , then ?
Your tilbury , your <unk> , your clothes , are not then hired ?
Good , so much the better , ” said Caderousse , his eyes sparkling with <unk> .
“ Oh , you knew that well enough before speaking to me , ” said Andrea , becoming more and more excited .
“ If I had been wearing a handkerchief like yours on my head , rags on my back , and <unk> shoes on my feet , you would not have known me . ” “ You wrong me , my boy ; now I have found you , nothing <unk> my being as <unk> as anyone , knowing , as I do , the goodness of your heart .
If you have two <unk> you will give me one of them .
I used to <unk> my <unk> and <unk> with you when you were hungry . ” “ True , ” said Andrea .
“ What an appetite you used to have !
Is it as good now ? ” “ Oh , yes , ” replied Andrea , laughing .
“ How did you come to be <unk> with that prince whose house you have just left ? ” “ He is not a prince ; simply a count . ” “ A count , and a rich one too , <unk> ? ” “ Yes ; but you had better not have anything to say to him , for he is not a very <unk> gentleman . ” “ Oh , be easy !
I have no design upon your count , and you shall have him all to yourself .
But , ” said Caderousse , again smiling with the disagreeable expression he had before assumed , “ you must pay for it — you understand ? ” “ Well , what do you want ? ” “ I think that with a hundred francs a month — — ” “ Well ? ” “ I could live — — ” “ Upon a hundred francs ! ” “ Come — you understand me ; but that with — — ” “ With ? ” “ With a hundred and fifty francs I should be quite happy . ” “ Here are two hundred , ” said Andrea ; and he placed ten gold louis in the hand of Caderousse .
<unk> “ Good ! ” said Caderousse .
“ <unk> to the steward on the first day of every month , and you will receive the same sum . ” “ There now , again you <unk> me . ” “ How so ? ” “ By making me apply to the servants , when I want to <unk> business with you alone . ” “ Well , be it so , then .
Take it from me then , and so long at least as I receive my income , you shall be paid yours . ” “ Come , come ; I always said you were a fine fellow , and it is a blessing when good fortune happens to such as you .
But tell me all about it ? ” “ Why do you wish to know ? ” asked Cavalcanti .
“ What ?
do you again <unk> me ? ” “ No ; the fact is , I have found my father . ” “ What ?
a real father ? ” “ Yes , so long as he <unk> me — — ” “ You ’ ll honor and believe him — that ’ s right .
What is his name ? ” “ <unk> Cavalcanti . ” “ Is he pleased with you ? ” “ So far I have appeared to answer his purpose . ” “ And who found this father for you ? ” “ The Count of Monte Cristo . ” “ The man whose house you have just left ? ” “ Yes . ” “ I wish you would try and find me a situation with him as grandfather , since he holds the <unk> ! ” “ Well , I will mention you to him .
Meanwhile , what are you going to do ? ” “ I ? ” “ Yes , you . ” “ It is very kind of you to trouble yourself about me . ” “ Since you interest yourself in my affairs , I think it is now my turn to ask you some questions . ” “ Ah , true .
Well ; I shall rent a room in some respectable house , wear a <unk> coat , <unk> every day , and go and read the papers in a <unk> .
Then , in the evening , I shall go to the theatre ; I shall look like some retired baker .
That is what I want . ” “ Come , if you will only put this scheme into execution , and be steady , nothing could be better . ” “ Do you think so , M. Bossuet ?
And you — what will you become ?
A <unk> of France ? ” “ Ah , ” said Andrea , “ who knows ? ” “ <unk> Cavalcanti is already one , perhaps ; but then , <unk> rank is <unk> . ” “ No politics , Caderousse .
And now that you have all you want , and that we understand each other , <unk> down from the tilbury and disappear . ” “ Not at all , my good friend . ” “ How ?
Not at all ? ” “ Why , just think for a moment ; with this red handkerchief on my head , with scarcely any shoes , no papers , and ten gold <unk> in my pocket , without <unk> what was there before — making in all about two hundred francs , — why , I should certainly be arrested at the <unk> .
Then , to <unk> myself , I should say that you gave me the money ; this would cause inquiries , it would be found that I left Toulon without giving due notice , and I should then be <unk> back to the <unk> of the <unk> .
Then I should become simply No .
<unk> , and <unk> to my dream of resembling the retired baker !
No , no , my boy ; I prefer remaining <unk> in the capital . ” Andrea <unk> .
Certainly , as he had himself owned , the <unk> son of <unk> Cavalcanti was a <unk> fellow .
He drew up for a minute , threw a rapid glance around him , and then his hand fell instantly into his pocket , where it began playing with a pistol .
But , meanwhile , Caderousse , who had never taken his eyes off his companion , passed his hand behind his back , and opened a long Spanish knife , which he always carried with him , to be ready in case of need .
The two friends , as we see , were worthy of and understood one another .
Andrea ’ s hand left his pocket <unk> , and was carried up to the red <unk> , which it played with for some time .
“ Good Caderousse , ” he said , “ how happy you will be . ” “ I will do my best , ” said the innkeeper of the Pont du <unk> , <unk> up his knife .
“ Well , then , we will go into Paris .
But how will you pass through the barrier without <unk> suspicion ?
It seems to me that you are in more danger <unk> than on foot . ” “ Wait , ” said Caderousse , “ we shall see . ” He then took the <unk> with the large collar , which the <unk> had left behind in the tilbury , and put it on his back ; then he took off Cavalcanti ’ s hat , which he placed upon his own head , and finally he assumed the <unk> attitude of a servant whose master <unk> himself .
“ But , tell me , ” said Andrea , “ am I to remain <unk> ? ” “ <unk> , ” said Caderousse ; “ it is so <unk> that your hat can easily appear to have <unk> off . ” “ Come , come ; enough of this , ” said Cavalcanti .
“ What are you waiting for ? ” said Caderousse .
“ I hope I am not the cause . ” “ Hush , ” said Andrea .
They passed the barrier without accident .
At the first cross street Andrea stopped his horse , and Caderousse leaped out .
“ Well ! ” said Andrea , — “ my servant ’ s coat and my hat ? ” “ Ah , ” said Caderousse , “ you would not like me to risk taking cold ? ” “ But what am I to do ? ” “ You ?
Oh , you are young while I am beginning to get old .
_ <unk> <unk> _ , Benedetto ; ” and running into a court , he disappeared .
“ Alas , ” said Andrea , <unk> , “ one cannot be completely happy in this world ! ” Chapter <unk> .
A <unk> <unk> At the Place Louis <unk> .
the three young people separated — that is to say , Morrel went to the <unk> , Château-Renaud to the Pont de la <unk> , and Debray to the <unk> .
Most probably Morrel and Château-Renaud returned to their “ domestic <unk> , ” as they say in the gallery of the Chamber in <unk> <unk> , and in the theatre of the Rue <unk> in <unk> pieces ; but it was not the case with Debray .
When he reached the <unk> of the <unk> , he turned to the left , <unk> across the <unk> , passed through the Rue <unk> , and , <unk> from the Rue de la <unk> , he arrived at M. Danglars ’ door just at the same time that Villefort ’ s <unk> , after having deposited him and his wife at the Faubourg <unk> , stopped to leave the baroness at her own house .
Debray , with the air of a man familiar with the house , entered first into the court , threw his <unk> into the hands of a <unk> , and returned to the door to receive Madame Danglars , to whom he offered his arm , to conduct her to her apartments .
The gate once closed , and Debray and the baroness alone in the court , he asked : “ What was the matter with you , <unk> ?
and why were you so affected at that story , or rather <unk> , which the count related ? ” “ Because I have been in such <unk> spirits all the evening , my friend , ” said the baroness .
“ No , <unk> , ” replied Debray ; “ you cannot make me believe that ; on the contrary , you were in excellent spirits when you arrived at the count ’ s .
M. Danglars was disagreeable , certainly , but I know how much you care for his <unk> .
<unk> has vexed you ; I will allow no one to <unk> you . ” “ You are deceived , Lucien , I assure you , ” replied Madame Danglars ; “ and what I have told you is really the case , added to the <unk> you remarked , but which I did not think it worth while to <unk> to . ” It was evident that Madame Danglars was suffering from that nervous <unk> which women frequently cannot account for even to themselves ; or that , as Debray had guessed , she had experienced some secret agitation that she would not acknowledge to anyone .
<unk> a man who knew that the former of these symptoms was one of the <unk> <unk> of <unk> , he did not then press his inquiries , but waited for a more <unk> opportunity when he should again <unk> her , or receive an <unk> _ <unk> <unk> _ .
At the door of her apartment the baroness met Mademoiselle <unk> , her <unk> maid .
“ What is my daughter doing ? ” asked Madame Danglars .
“ She <unk> all the evening , and then went to bed , ” replied Mademoiselle <unk> .
“ Yet I think I hear her <unk> . ” “ It is Mademoiselle Louise d ’ <unk> , who is playing while Mademoiselle Danglars is in bed . ” “ Well , ” said Madame Danglars , “ come and <unk> me . ” They entered the bedroom .
Debray stretched himself upon a large <unk> , and Madame Danglars passed into her dressing-room with Mademoiselle <unk> .
“ My dear M. Lucien , ” said Madame Danglars through the door , “ you are always <unk> that Eugénie will not address a word to you . ” “ Madame , ” said Lucien , playing with a little dog , who , <unk> him as a friend of the house , expected to be <unk> , “ I am not the only one who makes similar <unk> , I think I heard Morcerf say that he could not <unk> a word from his betrothed . ” “ True , ” said Madame Danglars ; “ yet I think this will all pass off , and that you will one day see her enter your study . ” “ My study ? ” “ At least that of the minister . ” “ Why so ! ” “ To ask for an engagement at the Opera .
Really , I never saw such an <unk> for music ; it is quite ridiculous for a young lady of fashion . ” Debray smiled .
“ Well , ” said he , “ let her come , with your consent and that of the baron , and we will try and give her an engagement , though we are very poor to pay such talent as hers . ” “ Go , <unk> , ” said Madame Danglars , “ I do not require you any longer . ” <unk> obeyed , and the next minute Madame Danglars left her room in a charming loose dress , and came and sat down close to Debray .
Then she began <unk> to <unk> the little <unk> .
Lucien looked at her for a moment in silence .
“ Come , <unk> , ” he said , after a short time , “ answer <unk> , — something <unk> you — is it not so ? ” <unk> “ Nothing , ” answered the baroness .
And yet , as she could scarcely breathe , she rose and went towards a <unk> .
“ I am frightful tonight , ” she said .
Debray rose , smiling , and was about to <unk> the baroness upon this latter point , when the door opened suddenly .
M. Danglars appeared ; Debray <unk> himself .
At the noise of the door Madame Danglars turned round , and looked upon her husband with an astonishment she took no trouble to conceal .
“ <unk> , madame , ” said the banker ; “ <unk> , M. Debray . ” <unk> the baroness thought this unexpected visit signified a desire to make up for the sharp words he had uttered during the day .
<unk> a <unk> air , she turned round to Debray , without answering her husband .
“ <unk> me something , M. Debray , ” she said .
Debray , who was slightly disturbed at this visit , recovered himself when he saw the calmness of the baroness , and took up a book marked by a <unk> knife <unk> with gold .
“ Excuse me , ” said the banker , “ but you will <unk> yourself , baroness , by such late hours , and M. Debray lives some distance from here . ” Debray was petrified , not only to hear Danglars speak so calmly and <unk> , but because it was apparent that beneath <unk> politeness there really <unk> a determined spirit of opposition to anything his wife might wish to do .
The baroness was also surprised , and showed her astonishment by a look which would doubtless have had some effect upon her husband if he had not been intently occupied with the paper , where he was looking to see the closing stock <unk> .
The result was , that the proud look entirely failed of its purpose .
“ M.
Lucien , ” said the baroness , “ I assure you I have no desire to sleep , and that I have a thousand things to tell you this evening , which you must listen to , even though you slept while hearing me . ” “ I am at your service , madame , ” replied Lucien coldly .
“ My dear M. Debray , ” said the banker , “ do not kill yourself tonight listening to the <unk> of Madame Danglars , for you can hear them as well tomorrow ; but I claim tonight and will <unk> it , if you will allow me , to talk over some serious matters with my wife . ” This time the blow was so well <unk> , and <unk> so directly , that Lucien and the baroness were <unk> , and they <unk> each other with their eyes , as if to seek help against this <unk> , but the irresistible will of the master of the house prevailed , and the husband was <unk> .
“ Do not think I wish to turn you out , my dear Debray , ” continued Danglars ; “ oh , no , not at all .
An unexpected <unk> forces me to ask my wife to have a little conversation with me ; it is so rarely I make such a request , I am sure you cannot <unk> it to me . ” Debray muttered something , bowed and went out , <unk> himself against the edge of the door , like <unk> in _ <unk> _ .
“ It is extraordinary , ” he said , when the door was closed behind him , “ how easily these <unk> , whom we <unk> , gain an advantage over us . ” <unk> Lucien having left , Danglars took his place on the sofa , closed the open book , and placing himself in a dreadfully <unk> attitude , he began playing with the dog ; but the animal , not <unk> him as well as Debray , and <unk> to <unk> him , Danglars seized him by the skin of his neck and threw him upon a <unk> on the other side of the room .
The animal uttered a cry during the <unk> , but , arrived at its <unk> , it <unk> behind the <unk> , and stupefied at such unusual treatment remained silent and motionless .
“ Do you know , sir , ” asked the baroness , “ that you are <unk> ?
<unk> you are only rude , but tonight you are brutal . ” “ It is because I am in a worse <unk> than usual , ” replied Danglars .
<unk> looked at the banker with supreme disdain .
These glances frequently <unk> the pride of Danglars , but this evening he took no notice of them .
“ And what have I to do with your <unk> ? ” said the baroness , irritated at the <unk> of her husband ; “ do these things concern me ?
<unk> your <unk> at home in your money boxes , or , since you have <unk> whom you pay , vent it upon them . ” “ Not so , ” replied Danglars ; “ your advice is wrong , so I shall not follow it .
My money boxes are my <unk> , as , I think , M. <unk> says , and I will not <unk> its course , or disturb its calm .
My <unk> are honest men , who earn my fortune , whom I pay much below their <unk> , if I may value them according to what they bring in ; therefore I shall not get into a passion with them ; those with whom I will be in a passion are those who eat my <unk> , <unk> my horses , and <unk> my fortune . ” “ And pray who are the persons who <unk> your fortune ?
<unk> yourself more clearly , I beg , sir . ” “ Oh , make yourself easy ! — I am not speaking <unk> , and you will soon know what I mean .
The people who <unk> my fortune are those who draw out <unk> francs in the course of an hour . ” “ I do not understand you , sir , ” said the baroness , trying to disguise the agitation of her voice and the <unk> of her face .
“ You understand me perfectly , on the contrary , ” said Danglars : “ but , if you will <unk> , I will tell you that I have just lost <unk> francs upon the Spanish <unk> . ” “ And pray , ” asked the baroness , “ am I <unk> for this loss ? ” “ Why not ? ” “ Is it my fault you have lost <unk> francs ? ” “ Certainly it is not mine . ” “ Once for all , sir , ” replied the baroness <unk> , “ I tell you I will not hear <unk> named ; it is a style of language I never heard in the house of my parents or in that of my first husband . ” “ Oh , I can well believe that , for neither of them was worth a <unk> . ” “ The better reason for my not being <unk> with the slang of the bank , which is here <unk> in my ears from morning to night ; that noise of <unk> crowns , which are constantly being counted and <unk> , is <unk> to me .
I only know one thing I dislike more , which is the sound of your voice . ” “ Really ? ” said Danglars .
“ Well , this <unk> me , for I thought you took the <unk> interest in all my affairs ! ” <unk> “ I ?
What could put such an idea into your head ? ” “ <unk> . ” “ Ah ? — what next ? ” “ Most assuredly . ” “ I should like to know upon what occasion ? ” “ Oh , _ <unk> Dieu ! _ that is very easily done .
Last February you were the first who told me of the <unk> <unk> .
You had dreamed that a ship had entered the <unk> at Le <unk> , that this ship brought news that a <unk> we had looked upon as lost was going to be made .
I know how <unk> your dreams are ; I therefore purchased immediately as many <unk> as I could of the <unk> debt , and I gained <unk> francs by it , of which <unk> have been <unk> paid to you .
You spent it as you pleased ; that was your business .
In March there was a question about a grant to a <unk> .
Three <unk> presented themselves , each offering equal <unk> .
You told me that your instinct , — and although you pretend to know nothing about <unk> , I think on the contrary , that your <unk> is very clear upon certain affairs , — well , you told me that your instinct led you to believe the grant would be given to the company called the <unk> .
I bought two <unk> of the <unk> of that company ; as you had <unk> , the <unk> <unk> in value , and I picked up a million , from which <unk> francs were paid to you for <unk> .
How have you spent this <unk> francs ? — it is no business of mine . ” “ When are you coming to the point ? ” cried the baroness , shivering with anger and impatience .
“ <unk> , madame , I am coming to it . ” “ That ’ s fortunate . ” “ In April you went to dine at the minister ’ s .
You heard a private conversation respecting Spanish affairs — on the <unk> of Don <unk> .
I bought some Spanish <unk> .
The <unk> took place and I <unk> <unk> francs the day Charles <unk> <unk> the <unk> .
Of these <unk> francs you took <unk> crowns .
They were yours , you disposed of them according to your fancy , and I asked no questions ; but it is not the less true that you have this year received <unk> livres . ” “ Well , sir , and what then ? ” “ Ah , yes , it was just after this that you <unk> everything . ” “ Really , your manner of speaking — — ” “ It <unk> my meaning , and that is all I want .
Well , three days after that you talked politics with M. Debray , and you fancied from his words that Don <unk> had returned to Spain .
Well , I sold my <unk> , the news got out , and I no longer sold — I gave them away , next day I find the news was false , and by this false report I have lost <unk> francs . ” “ Well ? ” “ Well , since I gave you a fourth of my <unk> , I think you owe me a fourth of my <unk> ; the fourth of <unk> francs is <unk> francs . ” “ What you say is absurd , and I cannot see why M. Debray ’ s name is mixed up in this affair . ” “ Because if you do not possess the <unk> francs I <unk> , you must have lent them to your friends , and M. Debray is one of your friends . ” <unk> “ For shame ! ” exclaimed the baroness .
“ Oh , let us have no <unk> , no <unk> , no modern drama , or you will oblige me to tell you that I see Debray leave here , <unk> the whole of the <unk> livres you have handed over to him this year , while he smiles to himself , saying that he has found what the most skilful <unk> have never discovered — that is , a <unk> where he <unk> without playing , and is no <unk> when he <unk> . ” The baroness became <unk> .
“ <unk> ! ” she cried , “ will you dare to tell me you did not know what you now reproach me with ? ” “ I do not say that I did know it , and I do not say that I did not know it .
I merely tell you to look into my conduct during the last four years that we have ceased to be husband and wife , and see whether it has not always been <unk> .
Some time after our <unk> , you wished to study music , under the celebrated <unk> who made such a successful appearance at the <unk> <unk> ; at the same time I felt inclined to learn dancing of the _ <unk> _ who acquired such a reputation in London .
This cost me , on your account and mine , <unk> francs .
I said nothing , for we must have peace in the house ; and <unk> francs for a lady and gentleman to be properly <unk> in music and dancing are not too much .
Well , you soon become tired of singing , and you take a fancy to study <unk> with the minister ’ s secretary .
You understand , it <unk> nothing to me so long as you pay for your <unk> out of your own <unk> box .
But today I find you are drawing on mine , and that your <unk> may cost me <unk> francs per month .
Stop there , madame , for this cannot last .
<unk> the <unk> must give his <unk> <unk> , and I will <unk> him , or he must never set his foot again in my house ; — do you understand , madame ? ” “ Oh , this is too much , ” cried <unk> , <unk> , “ you are worse than <unk> . ” “ But , ” continued Danglars , “ I find you did not even pause there — — ” “ <unk> ! ” “ You are right ; let us leave these facts alone , and reason <unk> .
I have never <unk> in your affairs excepting for your good ; treat me in the same way .
You say you have nothing to do with my <unk> box .
Be it so .
Do as you like with your own , but do not fill or empty mine .
Besides , how do I know that this was not a political <unk> , that the minister <unk> at seeing me in the opposition , and jealous of the popular sympathy I excite , has not <unk> with M. Debray to ruin me ? ” “ A probable thing ! ” “ Why not ?
Who ever heard of such an <unk> as this ? — a false <unk> <unk> — it is almost impossible for wrong <unk> to be made as they were in the last two <unk> .
It was done on purpose for me — I am sure of it . ” “ Sir , ” said the baroness <unk> , “ are you not aware that the man employed there was <unk> , that they talked of going to law with him , that orders were <unk> to arrest him and that this order would have been put into execution if he had not escaped by flight , which <unk> that he was either mad or guilty ?
It was a mistake . ” “ Yes , which made <unk> laugh , which caused the minister to have a <unk> night , which has caused the minister ’ s <unk> to <unk> several sheets of paper , but which has cost me <unk> francs . ” “ But , sir , ” said <unk> suddenly , “ if all this is , as you say , caused by M. Debray , why , instead of going direct to him , do you come and tell me of it ?
Why , to <unk> the man , do you address the woman ? ” “ Do I know M. Debray ? — do I wish to know him ? — do I wish to know that he gives advice ? — do I wish to follow it ? — do I <unk> ?
No ; you do all this , not I. ” “ Still it seems to me , that as you profit by it — — ” Danglars shrugged his shoulders .
“ <unk> creature , ” he exclaimed .
“ <unk> fancy they have talent because they have managed two or three <unk> without being the talk of Paris !
But know that if you had even hidden your <unk> from your husband , who has but the <unk> of the art — for generally <unk> _ will _ not see — you would then have been but a faint <unk> of most of your friends among the women of the world .
But it has not been so with me , — I see , and always have seen , during the last sixteen years .
You may , perhaps , have hidden a thought ; but not a step , not an action , not a fault , has escaped me , while you flattered yourself upon your address , and firmly believed you had deceived me .
What has been the result ? — that , thanks to my pretended ignorance , there is none of your friends , from M. de Villefort to M. Debray , who has not trembled before me .
There is not one who has not treated me as the master of the house , — the only title I desire with respect to you ; there is not one , in fact , who would have dared to speak of me as I have spoken of them this day .
I will allow you to make me <unk> , but I will prevent your <unk> me ridiculous , and , above all , I <unk> you to ruin me . ” The baroness had been tolerably composed until the name of Villefort had been pronounced ; but then she became pale , and , rising , as if touched by a spring , she stretched out her hands as though <unk> an apparition ; she then took two or three steps towards her husband , as though to tear the secret from him , of which he was ignorant , or which he <unk> from some <unk> <unk> , — <unk> , as all his <unk> were .
“ M.
de Villefort ! — What do you mean ? ” “ I mean that M. de <unk> , your first husband , being neither a philosopher nor a banker , or perhaps being both , and seeing there was nothing to be got out of a king ’ s attorney , died of grief or anger at finding , after an absence of nine months , that you had been _ <unk> _ six .
I am brutal , — I not only allow it , but boast of it ; it is one of the reasons of my success in <unk> business .
Why did he kill himself instead of you ?
Because he had no <unk> to save .
My life belongs to my <unk> .
M. Debray has made me lose <unk> francs ; let him bear his share of the loss , and we will go on as before ; if not , let him become <unk> for the <unk> livres , and do as all <unk> do — disappear .
He is a charming fellow , I allow , when his news is correct ; but when it is not , there are fifty others in the world who would do better than he . ” Madame Danglars was <unk> to the spot ; she made a violent effort to reply to this last attack , but she fell upon a chair thinking of Villefort , of the dinner scene , of the strange series of misfortunes which had taken place in her house during the last few days , and changed the usual calm of her establishment to a scene of <unk> <unk> .
Danglars did not even look at her , though she did her best to faint .
He shut the bedroom door after him , without <unk> another word , and returned to his apartments ; and when Madame Danglars recovered from her <unk> condition , she could almost believe that she had had a disagreeable dream .
Chapter <unk> .
<unk> <unk> The day following this scene , at the hour Debray usually chose to pay a visit to Madame Danglars on his way to his office , his _ <unk> _ did not appear .
At this time , that is , about half-past twelve , Madame Danglars ordered her carriage , and went out .
Danglars , hidden behind a curtain , watched the departure he had been waiting for .
He gave orders that he should be informed as soon as Madame Danglars appeared ; but at two o ’ clock she had not returned .
He then called for his horses , drove to the Chamber , and <unk> his name to speak against the <unk> .
From twelve to two o ’ clock Danglars had remained in his study , <unk> his <unk> , and becoming more and more sad every minute , <unk> figure upon figure , and receiving , among other visits , one from <unk> Cavalcanti , who , as stiff and exact as ever , presented himself precisely at the hour named the night before , to <unk> his business with the banker .
On leaving the Chamber , Danglars , who had shown violent marks of agitation during the sitting , and been more bitter than ever against the <unk> , re-entered his carriage , and told the coachman to drive to the <unk> des Champs-Élysées , No .
30 .
Monte Cristo was at home ; only he was engaged with someone and begged Danglars to wait for a moment in the drawing-room .
While the banker was waiting in the <unk> , the door opened , and a man dressed as an abbé and doubtless more familiar with the house than he was , came in and instead of waiting , merely bowed , passed on to the farther apartments , and disappeared .
A minute after the door by which the priest had entered <unk> , and Monte Cristo appeared .
“ Pardon me , ” said he , “ my dear baron , but one of my friends , the Abbé Busoni , whom you perhaps saw pass by , has just arrived in Paris ; not having seen him for a long time , I could not make up my mind to leave him sooner , so I hope this will be sufficient reason for my having made you wait . ” “ Nay , ” said Danglars , “ it is my fault ; I have chosen my visit at a wrong time , and will retire . ” “ Not at all ; on the contrary , be seated ; but what is the matter with you ?
You look <unk> ; really , you alarm me .
<unk> in a <unk> , like the appearance of a <unk> , <unk> some misfortune to the world . ” “ I have been in <unk> for several days , ” said Danglars , “ and I have heard nothing but bad news . ” “ Ah , indeed ? ” said Monte Cristo .
“ Have you had another fall at the <unk> ? ” “ No ; I am safe for a few days at least .
I am only <unk> about a <unk> of <unk> . ” “ Really ?
Does it happen to be Jacopo <unk> ? ” “ Exactly so .
<unk> a man who has <unk> business with me for I don ’ t know how long , to the amount of <unk> or <unk> francs during the year .
Never a mistake or delay — a fellow who paid like a prince .
Well , I was a million in advance with him , and now my fine Jacopo <unk> <unk> <unk> ! ” “ Really ? ” “ It is an <unk> fatality .
I draw upon him for <unk> francs , my <unk> are returned <unk> , and , more than that , I hold <unk> of exchange signed by him to the value of <unk> francs , <unk> at his correspondent ’ s in Paris at the end of this month .
<unk> is the <unk> .
I present them ; but my correspondent has disappeared .
This , with my Spanish affairs , made a pretty end to the month . ” “ Then you really lost by that affair in Spain ? ” “ Yes ; only <unk> francs out of my <unk> box — nothing more ! ” “ Why , how could you make such a mistake — such an old <unk> ? ” “ Oh , it is all my wife ’ s fault .
She dreamed Don <unk> had returned to Spain ; she <unk> in dreams .
It is <unk> , she says , and when she dreams a thing it is sure to happen , she <unk> me .
On this conviction I allow her to <unk> , she having her bank and her <unk> ; she <unk> and lost .
It is true she <unk> with her own money , not mine ; nevertheless , you can understand that when <unk> francs leave the wife ’ s pocket , the husband always finds it out .
But do you mean to say you have not heard of this ?
Why , the thing has made a tremendous noise . ” “ Yes , I heard it spoken of , but I did not know the details , and then no one can be more ignorant than I am of the affairs in the <unk> . ” <unk> “ Then you do not <unk> ? ” “ I ? — How could I <unk> when I already have so much trouble in <unk> my income ?
I should be obliged , besides my steward , to keep a clerk and a boy .
But touching these Spanish affairs , I think that the baroness did not dream the whole of the Don <unk> matter .
The papers said something about it , did they not ? ” “ Then you believe the papers ? ” “ I ? — not the least in the world ; only I fancied that the honest _ <unk> _ was an exception to the rule , and that it only announced <unk> <unk> . ” “ Well , that ’ s what <unk> me , ” replied Danglars ; “ the news of the return of Don <unk> was brought by telegraph . ” “ So that , ” said Monte Cristo , “ you have lost nearly <unk> francs this month . ” “ Not nearly , indeed ; that is exactly my loss . ” “ _ <unk> ! _ ” said Monte Cristo <unk> , “ it is a hard blow for a <unk> fortune . ” “ <unk> , ” said Danglars , rather humble , “ what do you mean by that ? ” “ Certainly , ” continued Monte Cristo , “ I make three <unk> in fortune — <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> <unk> .
I call those <unk> which are composed of treasures one possesses under one ’ s hand , such as <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> property , in such states as France , <unk> , and England , provided these treasures and property form a total of about a hundred millions ; I call those <unk> <unk> , that are gained by <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , not drawing more than <unk> francs , the whole forming a capital of about fifty millions ; finally , I call those <unk> <unk> , which are composed of a <unk> capital , <unk> upon the will of others , or upon chances which a <unk> <unk> or a false <unk> <unk> , such as banks , <unk> of the day — in fact , all <unk> under the influence of greater or less <unk> , the whole bringing in a real or <unk> capital of about fifteen millions .
I think this is about your position , is it not ? ” “ <unk> it , yes ! ” replied Danglars .
“ The result , then , of six more such months as this would be to <unk> the <unk> house to despair . ” “ Oh , ” said Danglars , becoming very pale , how you are running on ! ” “ Let us imagine seven such months , ” continued Monte Cristo , in the same tone .
“ Tell me , have you ever thought that seven times <unk> francs make nearly twelve millions ?
No , you have not ; — well , you are right , for if you indulged in such reflections , you would never risk your principal , which is to the <unk> what the skin is to <unk> man .
We have our clothes , some more splendid than others , — this is our credit ; but when a man <unk> he has only his skin ; in the same way , on <unk> from business , you have nothing but your real principal of about five or six millions , at the most ; for <unk> <unk> are never more than a fourth of what they appear to be , like the <unk> on a <unk> , the size of which is <unk> by the smoke and <unk> <unk> it .
Well , out of the five or six millions which form your real capital , you have just lost nearly two millions , which must , of course , in the same degree <unk> your credit and <unk> fortune ; to follow out my <unk> , your skin has been opened by bleeding , and this if repeated three or four times will cause death — so pay attention to it , my dear Monsieur Danglars .
Do you want money ?
Do you wish me to lend you some ? ” <unk> “ What a bad <unk> you are ! ” exclaimed Danglars , calling to his assistance all his philosophy and <unk> .
“ I have made money at the same time by <unk> which have succeeded .
I have made up the loss of blood by <unk> .
I lost a battle in Spain , I have been <unk> in <unk> , but my <unk> army in <unk> will have taken some <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> will have discovered some mine . ” “ Very good , very good !
But the wound remains and will <unk> at the first loss . ” “ No , for I am only <unk> in <unk> , ” replied Danglars , with the air of a <unk> <unk> his own <unk> ; “ to <unk> me , three <unk> must <unk> to dust . ” “ Well , such things have been . ” “ That there should be a <unk> ! ” “ <unk> the seven fat and the seven <unk> <unk> . ” “ Or , that the sea should become dry , as in the days of <unk> , and even then my <unk> would become <unk> . ” “ So much the better .
I congratulate you , my dear M. Danglars , ” said Monte Cristo ; “ I see I was deceived , and that you belong to the class of <unk> <unk> . ” “ I think I may <unk> to that honor , ” said Danglars with a smile , which reminded Monte Cristo of the <unk> <unk> which bad <unk> are so fond of <unk> into their <unk> of ruins .
“ But , while we are speaking of business , ” Danglars added , pleased to find an opportunity of changing the subject , “ tell me what I am to do for M. Cavalcanti . ” “ Give him money , if he is recommended to you , and the <unk> seems good . ” “ <unk> ; he presented himself this morning with a <unk> of <unk> francs , <unk> at sight , on you , signed by Busoni , and returned by you to me , with your <unk> — of course , I immediately counted him over the forty bank-notes . ” Monte Cristo nodded his head in <unk> of <unk> .
“ But that is not all , ” continued Danglars ; “ he has opened an account with my house for his son . ” “ May I ask how much he <unk> the young man ? ” “ Five thousand francs per month . ” “ <unk> thousand francs per year .
I thought I was right in believing that Cavalcanti to be a <unk> fellow .
How can a young man live upon <unk> francs a month ? ” “ But you understand that if the young man should want a few thousands more — — ” “ Do not advance it ; the father will never <unk> it .
You do not know these <unk> <unk> ; they are regular <unk> .
And by whom were they recommended to you ? ” “ Oh , by the house of <unk> , one of the best in <unk> . ” “ I do not mean to say you will lose , but , nevertheless , mind you hold to the terms of the agreement . ” “ Would you not trust the Cavalcanti ? ” “ I ?
oh , I would advance ten millions on his signature .
I was only speaking in <unk> to the <unk> <unk> we were <unk> just now . ” “ And with all this , how <unk> he is !
I should never have taken him for anything more than a mere major . ” “ And you would have flattered him , for certainly , as you say , he has no manner .
The first time I saw him he appeared to me like an old <unk> who had grown <unk> under his <unk> .
But all the <unk> are the same ; they are like old <unk> when they are not <unk> in <unk> splendor . ” “ The young man is better , ” said Danglars .
“ Yes ; a little nervous , perhaps , but , upon the whole , he appeared tolerable .
I was uneasy about him . ” “ Why ? ” “ Because you met him at my house , just after his introduction into the world , as they told me .
He has been travelling with a very severe <unk> , and had never been to Paris before . ” “ Ah , I believe <unk> marry amongst themselves , do they not ? ” asked Danglars <unk> ; “ they like to <unk> their <unk> . ” “ It is usual , certainly ; but Cavalcanti is an original who does nothing like other people .
I cannot help thinking that he has brought his son to France to choose a wife . ” “ Do you think so ? ” “ I am sure of it . ” “ And you have heard his fortune mentioned ? ” “ Nothing else was talked of ; only some said he was worth millions , and others that he did not possess a <unk> . ” “ And what is your opinion ? ” “ I ought not to influence you , because it is only my own personal impression . ” “ Well , and it is that — — ” “ My opinion is , that all these old _ <unk> _ , these ancient _ <unk> _ , — for the Cavalcanti have commanded <unk> and <unk> <unk> , — my opinion , I say , is , that they have buried their millions in corners , the secret of which they have <unk> only to their eldest <unk> , who have done the same from <unk> to <unk> ; and the proof of this is seen in their yellow and dry appearance , like the <unk> of the <unk> , which , from being constantly gazed upon , have become reflected in them . ” “ Certainly , ” said Danglars , “ and this is further supported by the fact of their not <unk> an <unk> of land . ” “ Very little , at least ; I know of none which Cavalcanti possesses , excepting his palace in <unk> . ” “ Ah , he has a palace ? ” said Danglars , laughing ; “ come , that is something . ” “ Yes ; and more than that , he <unk> it to the <unk> of <unk> while he lives in a simple house .
Oh , as I told you before , I think the old fellow is very close . ” “ Come , you do not <unk> him . ” “ I scarcely know him ; I think I have seen him three times in my life ; all I know relating to him is through Busoni and himself .
He was telling me this morning that , tired of letting his property lie <unk> in Italy , which is a dead nation , he wished to find a method , either in France or England , of <unk> his millions , but remember , that though I place great confidence in Busoni , I am not <unk> for this . ” “ Never mind ; accept my thanks for the <unk> you have sent me .
It is a fine name to <unk> on my <unk> , and my <unk> was quite proud of it when I explained to him who the Cavalcanti were .
By the way , this is merely a simple question , when this sort of people marry their <unk> , do they give them any fortune ? ” “ Oh , that depends upon circumstances .
I know an Italian prince , rich as a gold mine , one of the <unk> families in <unk> , who , when his <unk> married according to his wish , gave them millions ; and when they married against his consent , merely allowed them thirty crowns a month .
Should Andrea marry according to his father ’ s views , he will , perhaps , give him one , two , or three millions .
For example , supposing it were the daughter of a banker , he might take an interest in the house of the <unk> of his son ; then again , if he <unk> his choice , the major takes the key , <unk> his <unk> , and Master Andrea would be obliged to live like the <unk> of a Parisian family , by <unk> cards or <unk> the <unk> . ” “ Ah , that boy will find out some <unk> or <unk> <unk> ; he will want a crown , an <unk> <unk> , and <unk> . ” “ No ; these grand <unk> on the other side of the <unk> frequently marry into plain families ; like <unk> , they like to cross the race .
But do you wish to marry Andrea , my dear M. Danglars , that you are asking so many questions ? ” “ _ Ma foi _ , ” said Danglars , “ it would not be a bad <unk> , I fancy , and you know I am a <unk> . ” “ You are not thinking of Mademoiselle Danglars , I hope ; you would not like poor Andrea to have his throat cut by Albert ? ” “ Albert , ” repeated Danglars , <unk> his shoulders ; “ <unk> , well ; he would care very little about it , I think . ” “ But he is betrothed to your daughter , I believe ? ” “ Well , M. de Morcerf and I have talked about this marriage , but Madame de Morcerf and Albert — — ” “ You do not mean to say that it would not be a good match ? ” “ Indeed , I imagine that Mademoiselle Danglars is as good as M. de Morcerf . ” “ Mademoiselle Danglars ’ fortune will be great , no doubt , especially if the telegraph should not make any more <unk> . ” “ Oh , I do not mean her fortune only ; but tell me — — ” “ What ? ” “ Why did you not invite M. and Madame de Morcerf to your dinner ? ” “ I did so , but he <unk> himself on account of Madame de Morcerf being obliged to go to <unk> for the benefit of sea air . ” “ Yes , yes , ” said Danglars , laughing , “ it would do her a great deal of good . ” “ Why so ? ” “ Because it is the air she always breathed in her youth . ” Monte Cristo took no notice of this <unk> remark .
“ But still , if Albert be not so rich as Mademoiselle Danglars , ” said the count , “ you must allow that he has a fine name ? ” “ So he has ; but I like mine as well . ” “ Certainly ; your name is popular , and does honor to the title they have <unk> it with ; but you are too intelligent not to know that according to a <unk> , too firmly <unk> to be <unk> , a nobility which <unk> back five centuries is worth more than one that can only <unk> twenty years . ” “ And for this very reason , ” said Danglars with a smile , which he tried to make <unk> , “ I prefer M. Andrea Cavalcanti to M. Albert de Morcerf . ” “ Still , I should not think the <unk> would yield to the Cavalcanti ? ” “ The <unk> ! — Stay , my dear count , ” said Danglars ; “ you are a man of the world , are you not ? ” “ I think so . ” “ And you understand <unk> ? ” “ A little . ” “ Well , look at my <unk> , it is worth more than Morcerf ’ s . ” “ Why so ? ” “ Because , though I am not a baron by birth , my real name is , at least , Danglars . ” “ Well , what then ? ” “ While his name is not Morcerf . ” “ How ? — not Morcerf ? ” “ Not the least in the world . ” “ Go on . ” “ I have been made a baron , so that I actually am one ; he made himself a count , so that he is not one at all . ” “ Impossible ! ” “ Listen my dear count ; M. de Morcerf has been my friend , or rather my acquaintance , during the last thirty years .
You know I have made the most of my arms , though I never forgot my origin . ” “ A proof of great <unk> or great pride , ” said Monte Cristo .
“ Well , when I was a clerk , Morcerf was a mere <unk> . ” “ And then he was called — — ” “ Fernand . ” “ Only Fernand ? ” “ Fernand <unk> . ” “ You are sure ? ” “ _ <unk> ! _ I have bought enough fish of him to know his name . ” “ Then , why did you think of giving your daughter to him ? ” “ Because Fernand and Danglars , being both <unk> , both having become noble , both rich , are about equal in worth , excepting that there have been certain things mentioned of him that were never said of me . ” “ What ? ” “ Oh , nothing ! ” “ Ah , yes ; what you tell me <unk> to mind something about the name of Fernand <unk> .
I have heard that name in Greece . ” “ In <unk> with the affairs of Ali <unk> ? ” “ Exactly so . ” “ This is the mystery , ” said Danglars .
“ I acknowledge I would have given anything to find it out . ” “ It would be very easy if you much wished it ? ” “ How so ? ” “ <unk> you have some correspondent in Greece ? ” “ I should think so . ” “ At Yanina ? ” “ <unk> . ” “ Well , write to your correspondent in Yanina , and ask him what part was played by a Frenchman named Fernand <unk> in the catastrophe of Ali <unk> . ” “ You are right , ” exclaimed Danglars , rising quickly , “ I will write today . ” “ Do so . ” “ I will . ” <unk> “ And if you should hear of anything very <unk> — — ” “ I will communicate it to you . ” “ You will oblige me . ” Danglars rushed out of the room , and made but one <unk> into his _ <unk> _ .
Chapter <unk> .
The <unk> of the King ’ s <unk> Let us leave the banker driving his horses at their <unk> speed , and follow Madame Danglars in her morning <unk> .
We have said that at half-past twelve o ’ clock Madame Danglars had ordered her horses , and had left home in the carriage .
She directed her course towards the Faubourg Saint <unk> , went down the Rue <unk> , and stopped at the <unk> du <unk> .
She descended , and went through the passage .
She was very plainly dressed , as would be the case with a woman of taste walking in the morning .
At the Rue <unk> she called a cab , and directed the driver to go to the Rue de <unk> .
As soon as she was seated in the vehicle , she drew from her pocket a very thick black veil , which she tied on to her straw bonnet .
She then replaced the bonnet , and saw with pleasure , in a little <unk> , that her white complexion and brilliant eyes were alone visible .
The cab crossed the <unk> and entered the Rue de <unk> by the Place <unk> ; the driver was paid as the door opened , and <unk> lightly up the stairs Madame Danglars soon reached the <unk> des <unk> .
There was a great deal going on that morning , and many <unk> persons at the <unk> ; <unk> persons pay very little attention to women , and Madame Danglars crossed the hall without <unk> any more attention than any other woman calling upon her lawyer .
There was a great press of people in M. de Villefort ’ s antechamber , but Madame Danglars had no occasion even to pronounce her name .
The instant she appeared the <unk> rose , came to her , and asked her whether she was not the person with whom the procureur had made an <unk> ; and on her <unk> answer being given , he conducted her by a private passage to M. de Villefort ’ s office .
The magistrate was seated in an armchair , writing , with his back towards the door ; he did not move as he heard it open , and the <unk> pronounce the words , “ <unk> in , madame , ” and then <unk> it ; but no sooner had the man ’ s footsteps ceased , than he started up , drew the bolts , closed the curtains , and examined every corner of the room .
Then , when he had assured himself that he could neither be seen nor heard , and was consequently relieved of doubts , he said : “ Thanks , madame , — thanks for your <unk> ; ” and he offered a chair to Madame Danglars , which she accepted , for her heart beat so violently that she felt nearly <unk> .
<unk> “ It is a long time , madame , ” said the procureur , <unk> a <unk> with his chair , so as to place himself exactly opposite to Madame Danglars , — “ it is a long time since I had the pleasure of speaking alone with you , and I regret that we have only now met to enter upon a painful conversation . ” “ Nevertheless , sir , you see I have answered your first appeal , although certainly the conversation must be much more painful for me than for you . ” Villefort smiled bitterly .
“ It is true , then , ” he said , rather uttering his thoughts aloud than addressing his companion , — “ it is true , then , that all our actions leave their traces — some sad , others bright — on our paths ; it is true that every step in our lives is like the course of an <unk> on the <unk> ; — it leaves its track !
Alas , to many the path is traced by tears . ” “ Sir , ” said Madame Danglars , “ you can feel for my emotion , can you not ?
<unk> me , then , I <unk> you .
When I look at this room , — whence so many guilty creatures have departed , trembling and ashamed , when I look at that chair before which I now sit trembling and ashamed , — oh , it requires all my reason to convince me that I am not a very guilty woman and you a <unk> judge . ” Villefort dropped his head and sighed .
“ And I , ” he said , “ I feel that my place is not in the judge ’ s seat , but on the prisoner ’ s bench . ” <unk> “ You ? ” said Madame Danglars .
“ Yes , I. ” “ I think , sir , you <unk> your situation , ” said Madame Danglars , whose beautiful eyes <unk> for a moment .
“ The paths of which you were just speaking have been traced by all young men of ardent <unk> .
Besides the pleasure , there is always remorse from the indulgence of our passions , and , after all , what have you men to fear from all this ?
the world <unk> , and <unk> <unk> you . ” “ Madame , ” replied Villefort , “ you know that I am no <unk> , or , at least , that I never deceive without a reason .
If my brow be severe , it is because many misfortunes have <unk> it ; if my heart be petrified , it is that it might <unk> the blows it has received .
I was not so in my youth , I was not so on the night of the <unk> , when we were all seated around a table in the Rue du <unk> at Marseilles .
But since then everything has changed in and about me ; I am accustomed to brave difficulties , and , in the conflict to crush those who , by their own free will , or by chance , <unk> or <unk> , interfere with me in my career .
It is generally the case that what we most <unk> desire is as <unk> <unk> from us by those who wish to obtain it , or from whom we attempt to <unk> it .
Thus , the greater number of a man ’ s errors come before him <unk> under the <unk> form of necessity ; then , after error has been committed in a moment of excitement , of delirium , or of fear , we see that we might have avoided and escaped it .
The means we might have used , which we in our blindness could not see , then seem simple and easy , and we say , ‘ Why did I not do this , instead of that ? ’ <unk> , on the contrary , are rarely <unk> with remorse ; for the decision does not come from you , — your misfortunes are generally imposed upon you , and your faults the results of others ’ crimes . ” “ In any case , sir , you will allow , ” replied Madame Danglars , “ that , even if the fault were alone mine , I last night received a severe punishment for it . ” “ Poor thing , ” said Villefort , pressing her hand , “ it was too severe for your strength , for you were twice overwhelmed , and yet — — ” “ Well ? ” “ Well , I must tell you .
<unk> all your courage , for you have not yet heard all . ” “ Ah , ” exclaimed Madame Danglars , alarmed , “ what is there more to hear ? ” “ You only look back to the past , and it is , indeed , bad enough .
Well , picture to yourself a future more gloomy still — certainly frightful , perhaps <unk> ! ” The baroness knew how calm Villefort naturally was , and his present excitement frightened her so much that she opened her mouth to <unk> , but the sound died in her throat .
“ How has this terrible past been recalled ? ” cried Villefort ; “ how is it that it has escaped from the depths of the tomb and the <unk> of our hearts , where it was buried , to visit us now , like a phantom , <unk> our cheeks and <unk> our <unk> with shame ? ” “ Alas , ” said <unk> , “ doubtless it is chance . ” “ <unk> ? ” replied Villefort ; “ No , no , madame , there is no such thing as chance . ” “ Oh , yes ; has not a fatal chance revealed all this ?
Was it not by chance the Count of Monte Cristo bought that house ?
Was it not by chance he caused the earth to be dug up ?
Is it not by chance that the unfortunate child was <unk> under the trees ? — that poor innocent <unk> of mine , which I never even kissed , but for whom I wept many , many tears .
Ah , my heart clung to the count when he mentioned the dear <unk> found beneath the flowers . ” “ Well , no , madame , — this is the terrible news I have to tell you , ” said Villefort in a hollow voice — “ no , nothing was found beneath the flowers ; there was no child <unk> — no .
You must not weep , no , you must not groan , you must tremble ! ” “ What can you mean ? ” asked Madame Danglars , shuddering .
“ I mean that M. de Monte Cristo , <unk> <unk> these trees , found neither <unk> nor chest , because neither of them was there ! ” “ Neither of them there ? ” repeated Madame Danglars , her staring , <unk> eyes expressing her alarm .
“ Neither of them there ! ” she again said , as though <unk> to <unk> herself with the meaning of the words which escaped her .
“ No , ” said Villefort , <unk> his face in his hands , “ no , a hundred times no ! ” “ Then you did not <unk> the poor child there , sir ?
Why did you deceive me ?
Where did you place it ?
tell me — where ? ” “ There !
But listen to me — listen — and you will pity me who has for twenty years alone borne the heavy burden of grief I am about to reveal , without casting the least portion upon you . ” “ Oh , you <unk> me !
But speak ; I will listen . ” “ You recollect that sad night , when you were <unk> on that bed in the red damask room , while I , scarcely less agitated than you , awaited your <unk> .
The child was born , was given to me — motionless , breathless , <unk> ; we thought it dead . ” Madame Danglars moved rapidly , as though she would spring from her chair , but Villefort stopped , and clasped his hands as if to <unk> her attention .
“ We thought it dead , ” he repeated ; “ I placed it in the chest , which was to take the place of a coffin ; I descended to the garden , I dug a hole , and then flung it down in haste .
<unk> had I covered it with earth , when the arm of the Corsican was stretched towards me ; I saw a shadow rise , and , at the same time , a flash of light .
I felt pain ; I wished to cry out , but an <unk> <unk> ran through my veins and stifled my voice ; I fell <unk> , and fancied myself killed .
Never shall I forget your sublime courage , when , having returned to consciousness , I dragged myself to the foot of the stairs , and you , almost dying yourself , came to meet me .
We were obliged to keep silent upon the dreadful catastrophe .
You had the <unk> to <unk> the house , assisted by your nurse .
A duel was the pretext for my wound .
Though we scarcely expected it , our secret remained in our own keeping alone .
I was taken to <unk> ; for three months I struggled with death ; at last , as I seemed to <unk> to life , I was ordered to the South .
Four men carried me from Paris to <unk> , walking six leagues a day ; Madame de Villefort followed the <unk> in her carriage .
At <unk> I was put upon the <unk> , thence I passed on to the <unk> , whence I descended , merely with the current , to <unk> ; at <unk> I was again placed on my <unk> , and continued my journey to Marseilles .
My <unk> lasted six months .
I never heard you mentioned , and I did not dare inquire for you .
When I returned to Paris , I learned that you , the widow of M. de <unk> , had married M. Danglars .
“ What was the subject of my thoughts from the time consciousness returned to me ?
<unk> the same — always the child ’ s corpse , coming every night in my dreams , rising from the earth , and <unk> over the grave with <unk> look and gesture .
I inquired immediately on my return to Paris ; the house had not been inhabited since we left it , but it had just been let for nine years .
I found the <unk> .
I pretended that I <unk> the idea that a house belonging to my wife ’ s father and mother should pass into the hands of strangers .
I offered to pay them for <unk> the <unk> ; they demanded <unk> francs .
I would have given <unk> — I would have given <unk> .
I had the money with me ; I made the <unk> sign the deed of <unk> , and when I had obtained what I so much wanted , I <unk> to Auteuil .
No one had entered the house since I had left it .
“ It was five o ’ clock in the afternoon ; I ascended into the red room , and waited for night .
There all the thoughts which had disturbed me during my year of constant agony came back with double force .
The Corsican , who had declared the <unk> against me , who had followed me from <unk> to Paris , who had hid himself in the garden , who had struck me , had seen me <unk> the grave , had seen me <unk> the child , — he might become acquainted with your person , — nay , he might even then have known it .
Would he not one day make you pay for keeping this terrible secret ?
Would it not be a sweet revenge for him when he found that I had not died from the blow of his <unk> ?
It was therefore necessary , before everything else , and at all <unk> , that I should cause all traces of the past to disappear — that I should destroy every material <unk> ; too much reality would always remain in my recollection .
It was for this I had <unk> the <unk> — it was for this I had come — it was for this I was waiting .
“ Night arrived ; I allowed it to become quite dark .
I was without a light in that room ; when the wind shook all the doors , behind which I continually expected to see some spy concealed , I trembled .
I seemed everywhere to hear your <unk> behind me in the bed , and I dared not turn around .
My heart beat so violently that I feared my wound would open .
At length , one by one , all the <unk> in the neighborhood ceased .
I understood that I had nothing to fear , that I should neither be seen nor heard , so I decided upon descending to the garden .
“ Listen , <unk> ; I consider myself as brave as most men , but when I drew from my breast the little key of the staircase , which I had found in my coat — that little key we both used to <unk> so much , which you wished to have fastened to a golden ring — when I opened the door , and saw the pale moon <unk> a long stream of white light on the <unk> staircase like a spectre , I leaned against the wall , and nearly <unk> .
I seemed to be going mad .
At last I <unk> my agitation .
I descended the staircase step by step ; the only thing I could not <unk> was a strange trembling in my knees .
I grasped the <unk> ; if I had <unk> my hold for a moment , I should have fallen .
I reached the lower door .
<unk> this door a <unk> was placed against the wall ; I took it , and advanced towards the thicket .
I had provided myself with a dark lantern .
In the middle of the lawn I stopped to light it , then I continued my path .
“ It was the end of November , all the <unk> of the garden had disappeared , the trees were nothing more than <unk> with their long <unk> arms , and the dead leaves sounded on the <unk> under my feet .
My terror <unk> me to such a degree as I approached the thicket , that I took a pistol from my pocket and armed myself .
I fancied continually that I saw the figure of the Corsican between the branches .
I examined the thicket with my dark lantern ; it was empty .
I looked carefully around ; I was indeed alone , — no noise disturbed the silence but the <unk> , whose piercing cry seemed to be calling up the <unk> of the night .
I tied my lantern to a <unk> branch I had noticed a year before at the precise spot where I stopped to <unk> the hole .
“ The grass had grown very <unk> there during the summer , and when autumn arrived no one had been there to <unk> it .
Still one place where the grass was thin attracted my attention ; it evidently was there I had turned up the ground .
I went to work .
The hour , then , for which I had been waiting during the last year had at length arrived .
How I worked , how I hoped , how I struck every piece of <unk> , thinking to find some resistance to my <unk> !
But no , I found nothing , though I had made a hole twice as large as the first .
I thought I had been deceived — had mistaken the spot .
I turned around , I looked at the trees , I tried to recall the details which had struck me at the time .
A cold , sharp wind <unk> through the <unk> branches , and yet the drops fell from my forehead .
I recollected that I was <unk> just as I was <unk> the ground to fill up the hole ; while doing so I had leaned against a <unk> ; behind me was an <unk> <unk> , intended to serve as a <unk> for persons walking in the garden ; in falling , my hand , <unk> its hold of the <unk> , felt the <unk> of the stone .
On my right I saw the tree , behind me the rock .
I stood in the same attitude , and threw myself down .
I rose , and again began <unk> and <unk> the hole ; still I found nothing , nothing — the chest was no longer there ! ” <unk> “ The chest no longer there ? ” murmured Madame Danglars , <unk> with fear .
“ Think not I contented myself with this one effort , ” continued Villefort .
“ No ; I searched the whole thicket .
I thought the assassin , having discovered the chest , and supposing it to be a treasure , had intended carrying it off , but , perceiving his error , had dug another hole , and deposited it there ; but I could find nothing .
Then the idea struck me that he had not taken these precautions , and had simply thrown it in a corner .
In the last case I must wait for daylight to <unk> my search .
I remained in the room and waited . ” “ Oh , Heaven ! ” <unk> When daylight <unk> I went down again .
My first visit was to the thicket .
I hoped to find some traces which had escaped me in the darkness .
I had turned up the earth over a surface of more than twenty feet square , and a depth of two feet .
A <unk> would not have done in a day what occupied me an hour .
But I could find nothing — absolutely nothing .
Then I renewed the search .
<unk> it had been thrown aside , it would probably be on the path which led to the little gate ; but this examination was as useless as the first , and with a <unk> heart I returned to the thicket , which now contained no hope for me . ” “ Oh , ” cried Madame Danglars , “ it was enough to drive you mad ! ” “ I hoped for a moment that it might , ” said Villefort ; “ but that happiness was denied me .
However , <unk> my strength and my ideas , ‘ Why , ’ said I , ‘ should that man have carried away the corpse ? ’ ” “ But you said , ” replied Madame Danglars , “ he would require it as a proof . ” “ Ah , no , madame , that could not be .
<unk> bodies are not kept a year ; they are shown to a magistrate , and the evidence is taken .
Now , nothing of the kind has happened . ” “ What then ? ” asked <unk> , trembling violently .
“ Something more terrible , more fatal , more alarming for us — the child was , perhaps , alive , and the assassin may have saved it ! ” Madame Danglars uttered a piercing cry , and , seizing Villefort ’ s hands , exclaimed , “ My child was alive ? ” said she ; “ you buried my child alive ?
You were not certain my child was dead , and you buried it ?
Ah — — ” Madame Danglars had risen , and stood before the procureur , whose hands she <unk> in her feeble grasp .
“ I know not ; I merely suppose so , as I might suppose anything else , ” replied Villefort with a look so fixed , it indicated that his powerful mind was on the verge of despair and madness .
“ Ah , my child , my poor child ! ” cried the baroness , falling on her chair , and <unk> her sobs in her handkerchief .
Villefort , becoming somewhat reassured , perceived that to <unk> the <unk> storm <unk> over his head , he must inspire Madame Danglars with the terror he felt .
“ You understand , then , that if it were so , ” said he , rising in his turn , and approaching the baroness , to speak to her in a lower tone , “ we are lost .
This child lives , and someone knows it lives — someone is in possession of our secret ; and since Monte Cristo speaks before us of a child <unk> , when that child could not be found , it is he who is in possession of our secret . ” “ Just God , <unk> God ! ” murmured Madame Danglars .
Villefort ’ s only answer was a stifled groan .
“ But the child — the child , sir ? ” repeated the agitated mother .
“ How I have searched for him , ” replied Villefort , <unk> his hands ; “ how I have called him in my long <unk> nights ; how I have longed for royal wealth to purchase a million of secrets from a million of men , and to find mine among them !
At last , one day , when for the <unk> time I took up my <unk> , I asked myself again and again what the Corsican could have done with the child .
A child <unk> a <unk> ; perhaps , on perceiving it was still alive , he had thrown it into the river . ” “ Impossible ! ” cried Madame Danglars : “ a man may murder another out of revenge , but he would not <unk> <unk> a child . ” “ Perhaps , ” continued Villefort , “ he had put it in the <unk> hospital . ” “ Oh , yes , yes , ” cried the baroness ; “ my child is there ! ” “ I ran to the hospital , and learned that the same night — the night of the <unk> of September — a child had been brought there , wrapped in part of a fine linen <unk> , <unk> torn in half .
This portion of the <unk> was marked with half a baron ’ s crown , and the letter <unk> ” “ <unk> , truly , ” said Madame Danglars , “ all my linen is marked thus ; Monsieur de <unk> was a baron , and my name is <unk> .
Thank God , my child was not then dead ! ” “ No , it was not dead . ” “ And you can tell me so without fearing to make me die of joy ?
Where is the child ? ” Villefort shrugged his shoulders .
“ Do I know ? ” said he ; “ and do you believe that if I knew I would relate to you all its <unk> and all its adventures as would a <unk> or a <unk> <unk> ?
Alas , no , I know not .
A woman , about six months after , came to claim it with the other half of the <unk> .
This woman gave all the requisite particulars , and it was <unk> to her . ” “ But you should have inquired for the woman ; you should have traced her . ” “ And what do you think I did ?
I <unk> a criminal process , and employed all the most <unk> <unk> and skilful agents in search of her .
They traced her to <unk> , and there they lost her . ” “ They lost her ? ” “ Yes , forever . ” Madame Danglars had listened to this <unk> with a sigh , a tear , or a <unk> for every detail .
“ And this is all ? ” said she ; “ and you stopped there ? ” “ Oh , no , ” said Villefort ; “ I never ceased to search and to inquire .
However , the last two or three years I had allowed myself some <unk> .
But now I will begin with more <unk> and fury than ever , since fear <unk> me , not my conscience . ” “ But , ” replied Madame Danglars , “ the Count of Monte Cristo can know nothing , or he would not seek our society as he does . ” “ Oh , the <unk> of man is very great , ” said Villefort , “ since it <unk> the goodness of God .
Did you observe that man ’ s eyes while he was speaking to us ? ” “ No . ” “ But have you ever watched him carefully ? ” “ <unk> he is <unk> , but that is all ; one thing alone struck me , — of all the exquisite things he placed before us , he touched nothing .
I might have suspected he was <unk> us . ” “ And you see you would have been deceived . ” “ Yes , doubtless . ” “ But believe me , that man has other projects .
For that reason I wished to see you , to speak to you , to warn you against everyone , but especially against him .
Tell me , ” cried Villefort , fixing his eyes more <unk> on her than he had ever done before , “ did you ever reveal to anyone our connection ? ” “ Never , to anyone . ” “ You understand me , ” replied Villefort , <unk> ; “ when I say anyone , — pardon my <unk> , — to anyone living I mean ? ” “ Yes , yes , I understand very well , ” ejaculated the baroness ; “ never , I swear to you . ” “ Were you ever in the habit of writing in the evening what had <unk> in the morning ?
Do you keep a journal ? ” “ No , my life has been passed in <unk> ; I wish to forget it myself . ” “ Do you talk in your sleep ? ” <unk> “ I sleep <unk> , like a child ; do you not remember ? ” The color mounted to the baroness ’ s face , and Villefort turned <unk> pale .
“ It is true , ” said he , in so low a tone that he could hardly be heard .
“ Well ? ” said the baroness .
“ Well , I understand what I now have to do , ” replied Villefort .
“ In less than one week from this time I will ascertain who this M. de Monte Cristo is , whence he comes , where he goes , and why he speaks in our presence of children that have been <unk> in a garden . ” Villefort pronounced these words with an accent which would have made the count shudder had he heard him .
Then he pressed the hand the baroness <unk> gave him , and led her <unk> back to the door .
Madame Danglars returned in another cab to the passage , on the other side of which she found her carriage , and her coachman sleeping <unk> on his box while waiting for her .
Chapter <unk> .
A <unk> <unk> The same day during the interview between Madame Danglars and the procureur , a <unk> entered the Rue du <unk> , passed through the <unk> of No .
<unk> , and stopped in the yard .
In a moment the door was opened , and Madame de Morcerf <unk> , leaning on her son ’ s arm .
Albert soon left her , ordered his horses , and having arranged his toilet , drove to the Champs-Élysées , to the house of Monte Cristo .
The count received him with his <unk> smile .
It was a strange thing that no one ever appeared to advance a step in that man ’ s favor .
Those who would , as it were , force a passage to his heart , found an <unk> barrier .
Morcerf , who ran towards him with open arms , was chilled as he drew near , in spite of the friendly smile , and simply held out his hand .
Monte Cristo shook it coldly , according to his <unk> practice .
“ Here I am , dear count . ” “ <unk> home again . ” “ I arrived an hour since . ” “ From <unk> ? ” “ No , from <unk> . ” “ Indeed ? ” “ And I have come at once to see you . ” “ That is extremely kind of you , ” said Monte Cristo with a tone of perfect indifference .
“ And what is the news ? ” “ You should not ask a stranger , a <unk> , for news . ” “ I know it , but in asking for news , I mean , have you done anything for me ? ” “ Had you <unk> me ? ” said Monte Cristo , <unk> uneasiness .
“ Come , come , ” said Albert , “ do not assume so much indifference .
It is said , sympathy <unk> rapidly , and when at <unk> , I felt the <unk> shock ; you have either been working for me or thinking of me . ” “ <unk> , ” said Monte Cristo , “ I have indeed thought of you , but the <unk> <unk> I was <unk> acted , indeed , without my knowledge . ” <unk> “ Indeed !
Pray tell me how it happened . ” “ <unk> .
M. Danglars dined with me . ” “ I know it ; to avoid meeting him , my mother and I left town . ” “ But he met here M. Andrea Cavalcanti . ” “ Your Italian prince ? ” “ Not so fast ; M. Andrea only calls himself count . ” “ <unk> himself , do you say ? ” “ Yes , calls himself . ” “ Is he not a count ? ” “ What can I know of him ?
He calls himself so .
I , of course , give him the same title , and everyone else does likewise . ” “ What a strange man you are !
What next ?
You say M. Danglars dined here ? ” “ Yes , with Count Cavalcanti , the marquis his father , Madame Danglars , M. and Madame de Villefort , — charming people , — M.
Debray , Maximilian Morrel , and M. de Château-Renaud . ” “ Did they speak of me ? ” “ Not a word . ” “ So much the worse . ” “ Why so ?
I thought you wished them to forget you ? ” “ If they did not speak of me , I am sure they thought about me , and I am in despair . ” “ How will that affect you , since Mademoiselle Danglars was not among the number here who thought of you ?
<unk> , she might have thought of you at home . ” “ I have no fear of that ; or , if she did , it was only in the same way in which I think of her . ” “ <unk> sympathy !
So you hate each other ? ” said the count .
“ Listen , ” said Morcerf — “ if Mademoiselle Danglars were disposed to take pity on my supposed <unk> on her account , and would <unk> with all <unk> <unk> between our two families , I am ready to agree to the arrangement .
In a word , Mademoiselle Danglars would make a charming mistress — but a wife — _ <unk> ! _ ” “ And this , ” said Monte Cristo , “ is your opinion of your intended <unk> ? ” “ Yes ; it is rather <unk> , I acknowledge , but it is true .
But as this dream cannot be realized , since Mademoiselle Danglars must become my <unk> wife , live <unk> with me , sing to me , <unk> verses and music within ten paces of me , and that for my whole life , it <unk> me .
One may <unk> a mistress , but a wife , — good heavens !
There she must always be ; and to marry Mademoiselle Danglars would be awful . ” “ You are difficult to please , viscount . ” “ Yes , for I often wish for what is impossible . ” “ What is that ? ” “ To find such a wife as my father found . ” Monte Cristo turned pale , and looked at Albert , while playing with some magnificent pistols .
“ Your father was fortunate , then ? ” said he .
“ You know my opinion of my mother , count ; look at her , — still beautiful , <unk> , more charming than ever .
For any other son to have <unk> with his mother for four days at <unk> , it would have been a <unk> or a <unk> , while I return , more contented , more peaceful — shall I say more <unk> ! — than if I had taken <unk> <unk> or <unk> as my companion . ” <unk> “ That is an <unk> <unk> , and you would make everyone <unk> to live a single life . ” “ Such are my reasons for not <unk> to marry Mademoiselle Danglars .
Have you ever noticed how much a thing is <unk> in value when we obtain possession of it ?
The diamond which <unk> in the window at <unk> ’ s or <unk> ’ s <unk> with more splendor when it is our own ; but if we are compelled to acknowledge the superiority of another , and still must retain the one that is inferior , do you not know what we have to endure ? ” “ <unk> , ” murmured the count .
“ Thus I shall rejoice when Mademoiselle Eugénie <unk> I am but a <unk> <unk> , with scarcely as many hundred thousand francs as she has millions . ” Monte Cristo smiled .
“ One plan occurred to me , ” continued Albert ; “ Franz likes all that is eccentric ; I tried to make him fall in love with Mademoiselle Danglars ; but in spite of four letters , written in the most <unk> style , he <unk> answered : ‘ My <unk> may be great , but it will not make me break my promise . ’ ” “ That is what I call devoted friendship , to recommend to another one whom you would not marry yourself . ” Albert smiled .
“ <unk> , ” continued he , “ Franz is coming soon , but it will not interest you ; you dislike him , I think ? ” “ I ? ” said Monte Cristo ; “ my dear viscount , how have you discovered that I did not like M. Franz !
I like everyone . ” “ And you <unk> me in the expression everyone — many thanks ! ” “ Let us not mistake , ” said Monte Cristo ; “ I love everyone as God <unk> us to love our neighbor , as <unk> ; but I thoroughly hate but a few .
Let us return to M. Franz d ’ Épinay .
Did you say he was coming ? ” “ Yes ; summoned by M. de Villefort , who is apparently as anxious to get Mademoiselle Valentine married as M. Danglars is to see Mademoiselle Eugénie settled .
It must be a very <unk> office to be the father of a <unk> daughter ; it seems to make one feverish , and to raise one ’ s pulse to <unk> <unk> a minute until the deed is done . ” “ But M. d ’ Épinay , unlike you , bears his misfortune <unk> . ” “ Still more , he <unk> seriously about the matter , <unk> on a white <unk> , and speaks of his family .
He <unk> a very high opinion of M. and Madame de Villefort . ” “ Which they deserve , do they not ? ” “ I believe they do .
M. de Villefort has always passed for a severe but a just man . ” “ There is , then , one , ” said Monte Cristo , “ whom you do not <unk> like poor Danglars ? ” “ Because I am not compelled to marry his daughter perhaps , ” replied Albert , laughing .
“ Indeed , my dear sir , ” said Monte Cristo , “ you are <unk> <unk> . ” “ I <unk> ?
how do you mean ? ” “ Yes ; pray take a <unk> , and cease to defend yourself , and to struggle to escape marrying Mademoiselle Danglars .
Let things take their course ; perhaps you may not have to <unk> . ” “ Bah ! ” said Albert , staring .
“ <unk> , my dear viscount , you will not be taken by force ; and seriously , do you wish to break off your engagement ? ” “ I would give a hundred thousand francs to be able to do so . ” “ Then make yourself quite easy .
M. Danglars would give double that sum to <unk> the same end . ” “ Am I , indeed , so happy ? ” said Albert , who still could not prevent an almost imperceptible cloud passing across his brow .
“ But , my dear count , has M. Danglars any reason ? ” “ Ah !
there is your proud and selfish nature .
You would <unk> the <unk> of another with a <unk> , but you <unk> if your own is attacked with a <unk> . ” “ But yet , M. Danglars appeared — — ” “ <unk> with you , was he not ?
Well , he is a man of bad taste , and is still more <unk> with another .
I know not whom ; look and judge for yourself . ” “ Thank you , I understand .
But my mother — no , not my mother ; I mistake — my father <unk> giving a ball . ” “ A ball at this season ? ” “ <unk> balls are fashionable . ” “ If they were not , the countess has only to wish it , and they would become so . ” “ You are right ; You know they are <unk> affairs ; those who remain in Paris in July must be true <unk> .
Will you take charge of our invitation to <unk> Cavalcanti ? ” “ When will it take place ? ” “ On Saturday . ” “ M.
Cavalcanti ’ s father will be gone . ” “ But the son will be here ; will you invite young M. Cavalcanti ? ” “ I do not know him , viscount . ” “ You do not know him ? ” “ No , I never saw him until a few days since , and am not <unk> for him . ” “ But you receive him at your house ? ” “ That is another thing : he was recommended to me by a good abbé , who may be deceived .
Give him a direct invitation , but do not ask me to present him .
If he were afterwards to marry Mademoiselle Danglars , you would <unk> me of <unk> , and would be <unk> me , — besides , I may not be there myself . ” “ Where ? ” “ At your ball . ” “ Why should you not be there ? ” “ Because you have not yet invited me . ” “ But I come <unk> for that purpose . ” “ You are very kind , but I may be prevented . ” “ If I tell you one thing , you will be so amiable as to set aside all <unk> . ” “ Tell me what it is . ” “ My mother <unk> you to come . ” “ The <unk> de Morcerf ? ” said Monte Cristo , starting .
“ Ah , count , ” said Albert , “ I assure you Madame de Morcerf speaks freely to me , and if you have not felt those <unk> <unk> of which I spoke just now <unk> within you , you must be entirely <unk> of them , for during the last four days we have spoken of no one else . ” “ You have talked of me ? ” “ Yes , that is the <unk> of being a living <unk> ! ” “ Then I am also a <unk> to your mother ?
I should have thought her too reasonable to be led by imagination . ” “ A problem , my dear count , for everyone — for my mother as well as others ; much studied , but not <unk> , you still remain an <unk> , do not fear .
My mother is only astonished that you remain so long <unk> .
I believe , while the <unk> G — — takes you for Lord <unk> , my mother <unk> you to be <unk> or the Count <unk> .
The first opportunity you have , <unk> her in her opinion ; it will be easy for you , as you have the philosophy of the one and the wit of the other . ” “ I thank you for the warning , ” said the count ; “ I shall endeavor to be prepared for all <unk> . ” “ You will , then , come on Saturday ? ” “ Yes , since Madame de Morcerf <unk> me . ” “ You are very kind . ” “ Will M. Danglars be there ? ” “ He has already been invited by my father .
We shall try to persuade the great d ’ <unk> , <unk> M. de Villefort , to come , but have not much hope of seeing him . ” “ ‘ Never despair of anything , ’ says the <unk> . ” “ Do you dance , count ? ” “ I dance ? ” “ Yes , you ; it would not be astonishing . ” “ That is very well before one is over forty .
No , I do not dance , but I like to see others do so .
Does Madame de Morcerf dance ? ” “ Never ; you can talk to her , she so <unk> in your conversation . ” “ Indeed ? ” <unk> “ Yes , truly ; and I assure you .
You are the only man of whom I have heard her speak with interest . ” Albert rose and took his hat ; the count conducted him to the door .
“ I have one thing to reproach myself with , ” said he , stopping Albert on the steps .
“ What is it ? ” “ I have spoken to you <unk> about Danglars . ” “ On the contrary , speak to me always in the same strain about him . ” “ I am glad to be reassured on that point .
<unk> , when do you aspect M. d ’ Épinay ? ” “ Five or six days hence at the <unk> . ” “ And when is he to be married ? ” “ <unk> on the arrival of M. and Madame de Saint-Méran . ” “ <unk> him to see me .
Although you say I do not like him , I assure you I shall be happy to see him . ” “ I will obey your orders , my lord . ” “ Good-bye . ” “ <unk> Saturday , when I may expect you , may I not ? ” “ Yes , I promised you . ” The Count watched Albert , <unk> his hand to him .
When he had mounted his <unk> , Monte Cristo turned , and seeing Bertuccio , “ What news ? ” said he .
“ She went to the <unk> , ” replied the steward .
“ Did she stay long there ? ” “ An hour and a half . ” “ Did she return home ? ” “ <unk> . ” “ Well , my dear Bertuccio , ” said the count , “ I now advise you to go in <unk> of the little estate I spoke to you of in <unk> . ” Bertuccio bowed , and as his wishes were in perfect <unk> with the order he had received , he started the same evening .
Chapter <unk> .
The <unk> M. de Villefort kept the promise he had made to Madame Danglars , to endeavor to find out how the Count of Monte Cristo had discovered the history of the house at Auteuil .
He wrote the same day for the required information to M. de Boville , who , from having been an inspector of prisons , was <unk> to a high office in the police ; and the latter begged for two days time to ascertain exactly who would be most likely to give him full particulars .
At the end of the second day M. de Villefort received the following note : “ The person called the Count of Monte Cristo is an intimate acquaintance of Lord Wilmore , a rich <unk> , who is sometimes seen in Paris and who is there at this moment ; he is also known to the Abbé Busoni , a <unk> priest , of high <unk> in the East , where he has done much good . ” M. de Villefort replied by <unk> the <unk> inquiries to be made respecting these two persons ; his orders were executed , and the following evening he received these details : “ The abbé , who was in Paris only for a month , inhabited a small <unk> house behind <unk> ; there were two rooms on each floor and he was the only <unk> .
The two lower rooms consisted of a dining-room , with a table , chairs , and <unk> of <unk> , and a <unk> <unk> , without <unk> , <unk> , or <unk> .
It was evident that the abbé limited himself to objects of strict necessity .
He preferred to use the <unk> upstairs , which was more library than <unk> , and was furnished with <unk> books and <unk> , in which he delighted to <unk> himself for months at a time , according to his valet de chambre .
His valet looked at the visitors through a sort of <unk> ; and if their faces were unknown to him or displeased him , he replied that the abbé was not in Paris , an answer which satisfied most persons , because the abbé was known to be a great traveller .
Besides , whether at home or not , whether in Paris or <unk> , the abbé always left something to give away , which the valet distributed through this <unk> in his master ’ s name .
The other room near the library was a bedroom .
A bed without curtains , four <unk> , and a <unk> , covered with yellow <unk> velvet , composed , with a _ <unk> _ , all its furniture .
“ Lord Wilmore <unk> in Rue <unk> .
He was one of those English <unk> who <unk> a large fortune in travelling .
He hired the apartment in which he lived furnished , passed only a few hours in the day there , and rarely slept there .
One of his <unk> was never to speak a word of French , which he however wrote with great <unk> . ” The day after this important information had been given to the king ’ s attorney , a man <unk> from a carriage at the corner of the Rue <unk> , and <unk> at an <unk> door , asked if the Abbé Busoni were within .
“ No , he went out early this morning , ” replied the valet .
“ I might not always be content with that answer , ” replied the visitor , “ for I come from one to whom everyone must be at home .
But have the kindness to give the Abbé Busoni — — ” “ I told you he was not at home , ” repeated the valet .
“ Then on his return give him that card and this sealed paper .
Will he be at home at eight o ’ clock this evening ? ” “ <unk> , unless he is at work , which is the same as if he were out . ” “ I will come again at that time , ” replied the visitor , who then retired .
At the appointed hour the same man returned in the same carriage , which , instead of stopping this time at the end of the Rue <unk> , drove up to the green door .
He knocked , and it opened immediately to admit him .
From the signs of respect the valet paid him , he saw that his note had produced a good effect .
“ Is the abbé at home ? ” asked he .
“ Yes ; he is at work in his library , but he <unk> you , sir , ” replied the valet .
The stranger ascended a rough staircase , and before a table , <unk> by a lamp whose light was <unk> by a large shade while the rest of the apartment was in <unk> darkness , he perceived the abbé in a <unk> ’ s dress , with a <unk> on his head such as was used by learned men of the <unk> <unk> .
“ Have I the honor of addressing the Abbé Busoni ? ” asked the visitor .
“ Yes , sir , ” replied the abbé ; “ and you are the person whom M. de Boville , formerly an inspector of prisons , sends to me from the prefect of police ? ” “ Exactly , sir . ” “ One of the agents appointed to secure the safety of Paris ? ” “ Yes , sir ” replied the stranger with a slight hesitation , and <unk> .
The abbé replaced the large spectacles , which covered not only his eyes but his <unk> , and sitting down motioned to his visitor to do the same .
“ I am at your service , sir , ” said the abbé , with a marked Italian accent .
“ The mission with which I am charged , sir , ” replied the visitor , speaking with hesitation , “ is a <unk> one on the part of him who <unk> it , and him by whom he is employed . ” The abbé bowed .
“ Your <unk> , ” replied the stranger , “ is so well known to the prefect that he wishes as a magistrate to ascertain from you some particulars connected with the public safety , to ascertain which I am <unk> to see you .
It is hoped that no <unk> of friendship or <unk> consideration will induce you to conceal the truth . ” “ <unk> , sir , the particulars you wish for do not interfere with my scruples or my conscience .
I am a priest , sir , and the secrets of confession , for instance , must remain between me and God , and not between me and human justice . ” “ Do not alarm yourself , monsieur , we will <unk> respect your conscience . ” At this moment the abbé pressed down his side of the shade and so raised it on the other , throwing a bright light on the stranger ’ s face , while his own remained <unk> .
“ Excuse me , abbé , ” said the <unk> of the prefect of the police , “ but the light <unk> my eyes very much . ” The abbé lowered the shade .
“ Now , sir , I am listening — go on . ” “ I will come at once to the point .
Do you know the Count of Monte Cristo ? ” “ You mean Monsieur <unk> , I presume ? ” “ <unk> ? — is not his name Monte Cristo ? ” “ Monte Cristo is the name of an estate , or , rather , of a rock , and not a family name . ” “ Well , be it so — let us not <unk> about words ; and since M. de Monte Cristo and M. <unk> are the same — — ” “ <unk> the same . ” “ Let us speak of M. <unk> . ” “ <unk> . ” “ I asked you if you knew him ? ” “ <unk> well . ” “ Who is he ? ” “ The son of a rich <unk> in <unk> . ” “ I know that is the report ; but , as you are aware , the police does not content itself with vague reports . ” “ However , ” replied the abbé , with an <unk> smile , “ when that report is in accordance with the truth , everybody must believe it , the police as well as all the rest . ” “ Are you sure of what you <unk> ? ” “ What do you mean by that question ? ” “ <unk> , sir , I do not in the least suspect your <unk> ; I ask if you are certain of it ? ” “ I knew his father , M. <unk> . ” “ Ah , indeed ? ” “ And when a child I often played with the son in the <unk> . ” “ But whence does he <unk> the title of count ? ” “ You are aware that may be bought . ” “ In Italy ? ” “ <unk> . ” “ And his immense riches , whence does he procure them ? ” “ They may not be so very great . ” “ How much do you suppose he possesses ? ” “ From one hundred and fifty to two hundred thousand livres per <unk> . ” “ That is reasonable , ” said the visitor ; “ I have heard he had three or four millions . ” “ Two hundred thousand per <unk> would make four millions of capital . ” “ But I was told he had four millions per <unk> . ” “ That is not probable . ” “ Do you know this Island of Monte Cristo ? ” “ Certainly , everyone who has come from <unk> , Naples , or Rome to France by sea must know it , since he has passed close to it and must have seen it . ” “ I am told it is a delightful place ? ” “ It is a rock . ” “ And why has the count bought a rock ? ” “ For the sake of being a count .
In Italy one must have <unk> <unk> to be a count . ” “ You have , doubtless , heard the adventures of M. <unk> ’ s youth ? ” “ The father ’ s ? ” “ No , the son ’ s . ” “ I know nothing certain ; at that period of his life , I lost sight of my young comrade . ” “ Was he in the <unk> ? ” “ I think he entered the service . ” “ In what branch ? ” “ In the <unk> . ” “ Are you not his <unk> ? ” “ No , sir ; I believe he is a <unk> . ” “ A <unk> ? ” “ I say , I believe such is the case , I do not <unk> it ; besides , liberty of conscience is established in France . ” “ <unk> , and we are not now <unk> into his <unk> , but his actions ; in the name of the prefect of police , I ask you what you know of him .
“ He passes for a very charitable man .
Our holy father , the <unk> , has made him a <unk> of Jesus Christ for the services he rendered to the <unk> in the East ; he has five or six <unk> as <unk> from <unk> <unk> of his services . ” “ Does he wear them ? ” “ No , but he is proud of them ; he is better pleased with <unk> given to the <unk> of man than to his <unk> . ” “ He is a <unk> then ? ” “ Exactly , he is a <unk> , with the exception of the peculiar dress . ” “ Has he any friends ? ” “ Yes , everyone who knows him is his friend . ” “ But has he any enemies ? ” “ One only . ” “ What is his name ? ” “ Lord Wilmore . ” “ Where is he ? ” “ He is in Paris just now . ” “ Can he give me any particulars ? ” “ <unk> ones ; he was in <unk> with <unk> . ” “ Do you know his abode ? ” “ It ’ s somewhere in the <unk> d ’ <unk> ; but I know neither the street nor the number . ” <unk> “ Are you at <unk> with the Englishman ? ” “ I love <unk> , and he <unk> him ; we are consequently not friends . ” “ Do you think the Count of Monte Cristo had ever been in France before he made this visit to Paris ? ” “ To that question I can answer positively ; no , sir , he had not , because he applied to me six months ago for the particulars he required , and as I did not know when I might again come to Paris , I recommended M. Cavalcanti to him . ” “ Andrea ? ” “ No , <unk> , his father . ” “ Now , sir , I have but one question more to ask , and I charge you , in the name of honor , of humanity , and of religion , to answer me <unk> . ” “ What is it , sir ? ” “ Do you know with what design M. de Monte Cristo purchased a house at Auteuil ? ” “ Certainly , for he told me . ” “ What is it , sir ? ” “ To make a <unk> asylum of it , similar to that <unk> by the Count of <unk> at <unk> .
Do you know about that <unk> ? ” “ I have heard of it . ” “ It is a magnificent charity . ” Having said this , the abbé bowed to <unk> he wished to pursue his studies .
The visitor either understood the abbé ’ s meaning , or had no more questions to ask ; he arose , and the abbé accompanied him to the door .
“ You are a great <unk> , ” said the visitor , “ and although you are said to be rich , I will venture to offer you something for your poor people ; will you accept my offering ? ” “ I thank you , sir ; I am only jealous in one thing , and that is that the relief I give should be entirely from my own resources . ” “ However — — ” “ My resolution , sir , is <unk> , but you have only to search for yourself and you will find , alas , but too many objects upon whom to exercise your <unk> . ” The abbé once more bowed as he opened the door , the stranger bowed and took his leave , and the carriage conveyed him straight to the house of M. de Villefort .
An hour afterwards the carriage was again ordered , and this time it went to the Rue <unk> , and stopped at No .
5 , where Lord Wilmore lived .
The stranger had written to Lord Wilmore , <unk> an interview , which the latter had fixed for ten o ’ clock .
As the <unk> of the prefect of police arrived ten minutes before ten , he was told that Lord Wilmore , who was <unk> and <unk> <unk> , was not yet come in , but that he would be sure to return as the clock struck .
The visitor was introduced into the drawing-room , which was like all other furnished <unk> .
A <unk> , with two modern <unk> <unk> , a <unk> <unk> <unk> with his bent bow , a mirror with an <unk> on each side — one <unk> <unk> carrying his guide , the other , <unk> <unk> — a <unk> paper ; red and black <unk> — such was the appearance of Lord Wilmore ’ s drawing-room .
It was illuminated by lamps with <unk> shades which gave only a feeble light , as if out of consideration for the <unk> ’ s weak sight .
After ten minutes ’ expectation the clock struck ten ; at the fifth stroke the door opened and Lord Wilmore appeared .
He was rather above the middle height , with thin <unk> <unk> , light complexion and light hair , turning rather gray .
He was dressed with all the English peculiarity , <unk> , in a blue coat , with <unk> <unk> and high collar , in the fashion of <unk> , a white <unk> waistcoat , and <unk> <unk> , three inches too short , but which were prevented by <unk> from <unk> up to the knee .
His first remark on entering was : “ You know , sir , I do not speak French ? ” “ I know you do not like to <unk> in our language , ” replied the <unk> .
“ But you may use it , ” replied Lord Wilmore ; “ I understand it . ” “ And I , ” replied the visitor , changing his <unk> , “ know enough of English to keep up the conversation .
Do not put yourself to the slightest inconvenience . ” “ <unk> ? ” said Lord Wilmore , with that tone which is only known to <unk> of Great <unk> .
The <unk> presented his letter of introduction , which the latter read with English coolness , and having finished : “ I understand , ” said he , “ perfectly . ” <unk> Then began the questions , which were similar to those which had been addressed to the Abbé Busoni .
But as Lord Wilmore , in the character of the count ’ s enemy , was less restrained in his <unk> , they were more numerous ; he described the youth of Monte Cristo , who he said , at ten years of age , entered the service of one of the petty <unk> of <unk> who make war on the English .
It was there Wilmore had first met him and fought against him ; and in that war <unk> had been taken prisoner , sent to England , and <unk> to the <unk> , whence he had escaped by <unk> .
Then began his <unk> , his <unk> , his <unk> ; then the insurrection in Greece broke out , and he had served in the <unk> ranks .
While in that service he had discovered a silver mine in the mountains of <unk> , but he had been careful to conceal it from everyone .
After the battle of <unk> , when the Greek government was <unk> , he asked of King <unk> a <unk> grant for that <unk> , which was given him .
Hence that immense fortune , which , in Lord Wilmore ’ s opinion , possibly <unk> to one or two millions per <unk> , — a <unk> fortune , which might be <unk> lost by the failure of the mine .
“ But , ” asked the visitor , “ do you know why he came to France ? ” “ He is <unk> in <unk> , ” said Lord Wilmore , “ and as he is an <unk> <unk> and <unk> , he has invented a new system of <unk> , which he is seeking to bring to perfection . ” “ How much does he spend <unk> ? ” asked the prefect .
“ Not more than five or six hundred thousand francs , ” said Lord Wilmore ; “ he is a <unk> . ” <unk> evidently inspired the Englishman , who , knowing no other reproach to bring on the count , accused him of <unk> .
“ Do you know his house at Auteuil ? ” “ Certainly . ” “ What do you know respecting it ? ” “ Do you wish to know why he bought it ? ” “ Yes . ” “ The count is a <unk> , who will certainly ruin himself in <unk> .
He <unk> there is in the neighborhood of the house he has bought a <unk> spring equal to those at <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
He is going to turn his house into a _ <unk> _ , as the <unk> <unk> it .
He has already dug up all the garden two or three times to find the famous spring , and , being <unk> , he will soon purchase all the <unk> houses .
Now , as I dislike him , and hope his <unk> , his <unk> telegraph , or his search for <unk> , will ruin him , I am watching for his <unk> , which must soon take place . ” “ What was the cause of your quarrel ? ” “ When he was in England he <unk> the wife of one of my friends . ” “ Why do you not seek revenge ? ” “ I have already fought three <unk> with him , ” said the Englishman , “ the first with the pistol , the second with the sword , and the third with the <unk> . ” “ And what was the result of those <unk> ? ” “ The first time , he broke my arm ; the second , he wounded me in the breast ; and the third time , made this large wound . ” The Englishman turned down his <unk> , and showed a scar , whose <unk> proved it to be a recent one .
“ So that , you see , there is a deadly <unk> between us . ” “ But , ” said the <unk> , “ you do not go about it in the right way to kill him , if I understand you <unk> . ” “ <unk> ? ” said the Englishman , “ I practice <unk> every day , and every other day <unk> comes to my house . ” This was all the visitor wished to ascertain , or , rather , all the Englishman appeared to know .
The agent arose , and having bowed to Lord Wilmore , who returned his <unk> with the stiff politeness of the English , he retired .
Lord Wilmore , having heard the door close after him , returned to his bedroom , where with one hand he pulled off his light hair , his red <unk> , his false <unk> , and his wound , to <unk> the black hair , dark complexion , and <unk> teeth of the Count of Monte Cristo .
It was M. de Villefort , and not the prefect , who returned to the house of M. de Villefort .
The procureur felt more at ease , although he had learned nothing really <unk> , and , for the first time since the <unk> at Auteuil , he slept <unk> .
Chapter <unk> .
The <unk> It was in the <unk> days of July , when in due course of time the Saturday arrived upon which the ball was to take place at M. de Morcerf ’ s .
It was ten o ’ clock at night ; the branches of the great trees in the garden of the count ’ s house stood out <unk> against the azure <unk> of heaven , which was <unk> with golden stars , but where the last <unk> clouds of a <unk> storm yet <unk> .
From the apartments on the ground floor might be heard the sound of music , with the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> , while brilliant <unk> of light shone through the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
At this moment the garden was only occupied by about ten servants , who had just received orders from their mistress to prepare the supper , the serenity of the weather <unk> to increase .
<unk> now , it had been <unk> whether the supper should take place in the dining-room , or under a long <unk> <unk> on the lawn , but the beautiful blue sky , <unk> with stars , had settled the question in favor of the lawn .
The gardens were illuminated with <unk> lanterns , according to the Italian custom , and , as is usual in countries where the <unk> of the table — the <unk> of all <unk> in their complete form — are well understood , the <unk> was loaded with <unk> and flowers .
<unk> At the time the <unk> of Morcerf returned to the rooms , after giving her orders , many guests were arriving , more attracted by the charming hospitality of the countess than by the distinguished position of the count ; for , owing to the good taste of Mercédès , one was sure of finding some <unk> at her <unk> worthy of <unk> , or even copying in case of need .
Madame Danglars , in whom the events we have related had caused deep anxiety , had hesitated about going to Madame de Morcerf ’ s , when during the morning her carriage happened to meet that of Villefort .
The latter made a sign , and when the carriages had drawn close together , said : “ You are going to Madame de Morcerf ’ s , are you not ? ” “ No , ” replied Madame Danglars , “ I am too ill . ” “ You are wrong , ” replied Villefort , <unk> ; “ it is important that you should be seen there . ” “ Do you think so ? ” asked the baroness .
“ I do . ” “ In that case I will go . ” And the two carriages passed on towards their different <unk> .
Madame Danglars therefore came , not only beautiful in person , but radiant with splendor ; she entered by one door at the time when Mercédès appeared at the door .
The countess took Albert to meet Madame Danglars .
He approached , paid her some well <unk> compliments on her toilet , and offered his arm to conduct her to a seat .
Albert looked around him .
“ You are looking for my daughter ? ” said the baroness , smiling .
“ I confess it , ” replied Albert .
“ Could you have been so cruel as not to bring her ? ” “ <unk> yourself .
She has met Mademoiselle de Villefort , and has taken her arm ; see , they are following us , both in white <unk> , one with a <unk> of <unk> , the other with one of <unk> .
But tell me — — ” “ Well , what do you wish to know ? ” “ Will not the Count of Monte Cristo be here tonight ? ” “ <unk> ! ” replied Albert .
“ What do you mean ? ” “ I only mean that the count seems the rage , ” replied the viscount , smiling , “ and that you are the <unk> person that has asked me the same question .
The count is in fashion ; I congratulate him upon it . ” “ And have you replied to everyone as you have to me ? ” “ Ah , to be sure , I have not answered you ; be satisfied , we shall have this ‘ lion ’ ; we are among the <unk> ones . ” “ Were you at the Opera yesterday ? ” “ No . ” “ He was there . ” “ Ah , indeed ?
And did the eccentric person commit any new <unk> ? ” “ Can he be seen without doing so ?
<unk> was dancing in _ Le <unk> <unk> _ ; the Greek <unk> was in <unk> .
After the <unk> he placed a magnificent ring on the <unk> of a <unk> , and threw it to the charming <unk> , who , in the third act , to do honor to the gift , reappeared with it on her finger .
And the Greek <unk> , — will she be here ? ” “ No , you will be deprived of that pleasure ; her position in the count ’ s establishment is not sufficiently understood . ” “ Wait ; leave me here , and go and speak to Madame de Villefort , who is trying to attract your attention . ” Albert bowed to Madame Danglars , and advanced towards Madame de Villefort , whose lips opened as he approached .
“ I <unk> anything , ” said Albert , <unk> her , “ that I know what you were about to say . ” “ Well , what is it ? ” “ If I guess rightly , will you confess it ? ” “ Yes . ” “ On your honor ? ” “ On my honor . ” “ You were going to ask me if the Count of Monte Cristo had arrived , or was expected . ” “ Not at all .
It is not of him that I am now thinking .
I was going to ask you if you had received any news of Monsieur Franz . ” “ Yes , — yesterday . ” “ What did he tell you ? ” “ That he was leaving at the same time as his letter . ” “ Well , now then , the count ? ” “ The count will come , of that you may be satisfied . ” “ You know that he has another name besides Monte Cristo ? ” “ No , I did not know it . ” “ Monte Cristo is the name of an island , and he has a family name . ” “ I never heard it . ” “ Well , then , I am better informed than you ; his name is <unk> . ” “ It is possible . ” “ He is a <unk> . ” “ That is also possible .
“ The son of a <unk> . ” “ Really , you should relate all this aloud , you would have the greatest success . ” “ He served in <unk> , discovered a mine in <unk> , and comes to Paris to <unk> a <unk> <unk> at Auteuil . ” “ Well , I ’ m sure , ” said Morcerf , “ this is indeed news !
Am I allowed to repeat it ? ” “ Yes , but <unk> , tell one thing at a time , and do not say I told you . ” “ Why so ? ” “ Because it is a secret just discovered . ” “ By whom ? ” “ The police . ” “ Then the news <unk> — — ” “ At the prefect ’ s last night .
Paris , you can understand , is astonished at the sight of such unusual splendor , and the police have made inquiries . ” “ Well , well !
Nothing more is wanting than to arrest the count as a <unk> , on the pretext of his being too rich . ” “ Indeed , that doubtless would have happened if his <unk> had not been so favorable . ” “ Poor count !
And is he aware of the danger he has been in ? ” “ I think not . ” “ Then it will be but charitable to inform him .
When he arrives , I will not fail to do so . ” Just then , a handsome young man , with bright eyes , black hair , and <unk> <unk> , <unk> bowed to Madame de Villefort .
Albert extended his hand .
“ Madame , ” said Albert , “ allow me to present to you M. Maximilian Morrel , captain of <unk> , one of our best , and , above all , of our <unk> officers . ” “ I have already had the pleasure of meeting this gentleman at Auteuil , at the house of the Count of Monte Cristo , ” replied Madame de Villefort , turning away with marked <unk> of manner .
This answer , and especially the tone in which it was uttered , chilled the heart of poor Morrel .
But a recompense was in <unk> for him ; turning around , he saw near the door a beautiful fair face , whose large blue eyes were , without any marked expression , fixed upon him , while the <unk> of <unk> was gently raised to her lips .
The <unk> was so well understood that Morrel , with the same expression in his eyes , placed his handkerchief to his mouth ; and these two living <unk> , whose hearts beat so violently under their marble aspect , separated from each other by the whole length of the room , forgot themselves for a moment , or rather forgot the world in their mutual contemplation .
They might have remained much longer lost in one another , without anyone <unk> their <unk> .
The Count of Monte Cristo had just entered .
We have already said that there was something in the count which attracted universal attention wherever he appeared .
It was not the coat , <unk> in its cut , though simple and <unk> ; it was not the plain white waistcoat ; it was not the trousers , that displayed the foot so perfectly formed — it was none of these things that attracted the attention , — it was his pale complexion , his <unk> black hair , his calm and serene expression , his dark and melancholy eye , his mouth , <unk> with such marvellous delicacy , which so easily expressed such high disdain , — these were what fixed the attention of all upon him .
Many men might have been <unk> , but certainly there could be none whose appearance was more _ significant _ , if the expression may be used .
Everything about the count seemed to have its meaning , for the constant habit of thought which he had acquired had given an ease and <unk> to the expression of his face , and even to the most trifling gesture , scarcely to be understood .
Yet the Parisian world is so strange , that even all this might not have won attention had there not been connected with it a mysterious story gilded by an immense fortune .
<unk> Meanwhile he advanced through the <unk> of guests under a <unk> of curious glances towards Madame de Morcerf , who , standing before a <unk> ornamented with flowers , had seen his entrance in a <unk> placed opposite the door , and was prepared to receive him .
She turned towards him with a serene smile just at the moment he was bowing to her .
No doubt she fancied the count would speak to her , while on his side the count thought she was about to address him ; but both remained silent , and after a mere bow , Monte Cristo directed his steps to Albert , who received him <unk> .
“ Have you seen my mother ? ” asked Albert .
“ I have just had the pleasure , ” replied the count ; “ but I have not seen your father . ” “ See , he is down there , talking politics with that little group of great <unk> . ” “ Indeed ? ” said Monte Cristo ; “ and so those gentlemen down there are men of great talent .
I should not have guessed it .
And for what kind of talent are they celebrated ?
You know there are different sorts . ” “ That tall , <unk> man is very learned , he discovered , in the neighborhood of Rome , a kind of <unk> with a <unk> more than <unk> usually have , and he immediately laid his discovery before the <unk> .
The thing was <unk> for a long time , but finally decided in his favor .
I can assure you the <unk> made a great noise in the learned world , and the gentleman , who was only a <unk> of the Legion of Honor , was made an officer . ” “ Come , ” said Monte Cristo , “ this cross seems to me to be <unk> <unk> .
I suppose , had he found another additional <unk> , they would have made him a <unk> . ” “ Very likely , ” said Albert .
“ And who can that person be who has taken it into his head to <unk> himself up in a blue coat embroidered with green ? ” “ Oh , that coat is not his own idea ; it is the Republic ’ s , which <unk> <unk> to <unk> a uniform for the <unk> . ” “ Indeed ? ” said Monte Cristo ; “ so this gentleman is an <unk> ? ” “ <unk> the last week he has been made one of the learned assembly . ” “ And what is his <unk> talent ? ” “ His talent ?
I believe he <unk> <unk> through the heads of <unk> , he makes <unk> eat <unk> , and <unk> the <unk> <unk> out of dogs with <unk> . ” “ And he is made a member of the <unk> of <unk> for this ? ” “ No ; of the French <unk> . ” “ But what has the French <unk> to do with all this ? ” “ I was going to tell you .
It seems — — ” “ That his <unk> have very <unk> advanced the cause of science , doubtless ? ” “ No ; that his style of writing is very good . ” “ This must be very <unk> to the feelings of the <unk> into whose heads he has thrust <unk> , to the <unk> whose bones he has <unk> red , and to the dogs whose <unk> <unk> he has <unk> out ? ” Albert laughed .
“ And the other one ? ” demanded the count .
“ That one ? ” “ Yes , the third . ” “ The one in the dark blue coat ? ” “ Yes . ” “ He is a <unk> of the count , and one of the most active <unk> to the idea of providing the Chamber of <unk> with a uniform .
He was very successful upon that question .
He stood badly with the <unk> papers , but his noble opposition to the wishes of the court is now getting him into favor with the <unk> .
They talk of making him an <unk> . ” <unk> “ And what are his claims to the <unk> ? ” “ He has composed two or three <unk> <unk> , written four or five <unk> in the _ <unk> _ , and <unk> five or six years on the <unk> side . ” “ <unk> , viscount , ” said Monte Cristo , smiling ; “ you are a delightful _ <unk> _ .
And now you will do me a favor , will you not ? ” “ What is it ? ” “ Do not introduce me to any of these gentlemen ; and should they wish it , you will warn me . ” Just then the count felt his arm pressed .
He turned round ; it was Danglars .
“ Ah !
is it you , baron ? ” said he .
“ Why do you call me baron ? ” said Danglars ; “ you know that I care nothing for my title .
I am not like you , viscount ; you like your title , do you not ? ” “ Certainly , ” replied Albert , “ seeing that without my title I should be nothing ; while you , <unk> the baron , would still remain the <unk> . ” “ Which seems to me the <unk> title under the <unk> of July , ” replied Danglars .
“ <unk> , ” said Monte Cristo , “ one ’ s title to a <unk> does not last for life , like that of baron , <unk> of France , or <unk> ; for example , the <unk> <unk> &amp; <unk> , of <unk> , who have just become <unk> . ” “ Indeed ? ” said Danglars , becoming pale .
“ Yes ; I received the news this evening by a <unk> .
I had about a million in their hands , but , warned in time , I withdrew it a month ago . ” “ Ah , _ <unk> Dieu ! _ ” exclaimed Danglars , “ they have drawn on me for <unk> francs ! ” “ Well , you can throw out the <unk> ; their signature is worth five per <unk> . ” “ Yes , but it is too late , ” said Danglars , “ I have <unk> their <unk> . ” “ Then , ” said Monte Cristo , “ here are <unk> francs gone after — — ” “ Hush , do not mention these things , ” said Danglars ; then , approaching Monte Cristo , he added , “ especially before young M. Cavalcanti ; ” after which he smiled , and turned towards the young man in question .
Albert had left the count to speak to his mother , Danglars to <unk> with young Cavalcanti ; Monte Cristo was for an instant alone .
Meanwhile the heat became excessive .
The <unk> were <unk> through the rooms with <unk> loaded with <unk> .
Monte Cristo wiped the perspiration from his forehead , but drew back when the waiter was presented to him ; he took no <unk> .
Madame de Morcerf did not lose sight of Monte Cristo ; she saw that he took nothing , and even noticed his gesture of refusal .
“ Albert , ” she asked , “ did you notice that ? ” “ What , mother ? ” “ That the count has never been willing to <unk> of food under the roof of M. de Morcerf . ” “ Yes ; but then he <unk> with me — indeed , he made his first appearance in the world on that occasion . ” “ But your house is not M. de Morcerf ’ s , ” murmured Mercédès ; “ and since he has been here I have watched him . ” “ Well ? ” “ Well , he has taken nothing yet . ” “ The count is very <unk> . ” Mercédès smiled sadly .
“ <unk> him , ” said she , “ and when the next waiter passes , insist upon his taking something . ” “ But why , mother ? ” “ Just to please me , Albert , ” said Mercédès .
Albert kissed his mother ’ s hand , and drew near the count .
Another <unk> passed , loaded like the preceding ones ; she saw Albert attempt to persuade the count , but he <unk> refused .
Albert <unk> his mother ; she was very pale .
“ Well , ” said she , “ you see he <unk> ? ” “ Yes ; but why need this <unk> you ? ” “ You know , Albert , women are singular creatures .
I should like to have seen the count take something in my house , if only an ice .
Perhaps he cannot <unk> himself to the French style of living , and might prefer something else . ” “ Oh , no ; I have seen him eat of everything in Italy ; no doubt he does not feel inclined this evening . ” “ And besides , ” said the countess , “ accustomed as he is to burning <unk> , possibly he does not feel the heat as we do . ” “ I do not think that , for he has <unk> of feeling almost <unk> , and asked why the <unk> <unk> were not opened as well as the windows . ” “ In a word , ” said Mercédès , “ it was a way of <unk> me that his <unk> was intended . ” And she left the room .
A minute afterwards the <unk> were thrown open , and through the <unk> and <unk> that <unk> the window one could see the garden ornamented with lanterns , and the supper laid under the <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , all uttered an exclamation of joy — everyone <unk> with delight the breeze that <unk> in .
At the same time Mercédès reappeared , <unk> than before , but with that <unk> expression of countenance which she sometimes wore .
She went straight to the group of which her husband formed the centre .
“ Do not <unk> those gentlemen here , count , ” she said ; “ they would prefer , I should think , to breathe in the garden rather than <unk> here , since they are not playing . ” “ Ah , ” said a gallant old general , who , in <unk> , had <unk> _ <unk> <unk> la <unk> _ , — “ we will not go alone to the garden . ” “ Then , ” said Mercédès , “ I will lead the way . ” <unk> towards Monte Cristo , she added , “ count , will you oblige me with your arm ? ” The count almost <unk> at these simple words ; then he fixed his eyes on Mercédès .
It was only a momentary glance , but it seemed to the countess to have lasted for a century , so much was expressed in that one look .
He offered his arm to the countess ; she took it , or rather just touched it with her little hand , and they together descended the steps , <unk> with <unk> and <unk> .
Behind them , by another <unk> , a group of about twenty persons rushed into the garden with loud <unk> of delight .
Chapter <unk> .
<unk> and <unk> Madame de Morcerf entered an <unk> of trees with her companion .
It led through a <unk> of <unk> to a <unk> .
“ It was too warm in the room , was it not , count ? ” she asked .
“ Yes , madame ; and it was an excellent idea of yours to open the doors and the <unk> . ” As he ceased speaking , the count felt the hand of Mercédès tremble .
“ But you , ” he said , “ with that light dress , and without anything to cover you but that <unk> <unk> , perhaps you feel cold ? ” “ Do you know where I am leading you ? ” said the countess , without replying to the question .
“ No , madame , ” replied Monte Cristo ; “ but you see I make no resistance . ” “ We are going to the <unk> that you see at the other end of the <unk> . ” The count looked at Mercédès as if to <unk> her , but she continued to walk on in silence , and he <unk> from speaking .
They reached the building , ornamented with magnificent <unk> , which <unk> at the beginning of July in the <unk> <unk> which takes the place of the sun , so frequently absent in our <unk> .
The countess left the arm of Monte Cristo , and gathered a bunch of <unk> <unk> .
“ See , count , ” she said , with a smile so sad in its expression that one could almost <unk> the tears on her eyelids — “ see , our French <unk> are not to be compared , I know , with yours of <unk> and <unk> , but you will make <unk> for our <unk> sun . ” The count bowed , but stepped back .
“ Do you refuse ? ” said Mercédès , in a <unk> voice .
“ Pray excuse me , madame , ” replied Monte Cristo , “ but I never eat <unk> <unk> . ” Mercédès let them fall , and sighed .
A magnificent <unk> was hanging against an adjoining wall , <unk> by the same <unk> heat .
Mercédès drew near , and <unk> the fruit .
“ Take this <unk> , then , ” she said .
The count again refused .
“ What , again ? ” she exclaimed , in so <unk> an accent that it seemed to <unk> a sob ; “ really , you pain me . ” A long silence followed ; the <unk> , like the <unk> , fell to the ground .
“ Count , ” added Mercédès with a <unk> glance , “ there is a beautiful Arabian custom , which makes eternal friends of those who have together eaten bread and <unk> under the same roof . ” “ I know it , madame , ” replied the count ; “ but we are in France , and not in <unk> , and in France eternal <unk> are as rare as the custom of <unk> bread and <unk> with one another . ” “ But , ” said the countess , <unk> , with her eyes fixed on Monte Cristo , whose arm she convulsively pressed with both hands , “ we are friends , are we not ? ” The count became pale as death , the blood rushed to his heart , and then again rising , <unk> his cheeks with <unk> ; his eyes <unk> like those of a man suddenly dazzled .
“ Certainly , we are friends , ” he replied ; “ why should we not be ? ” The answer was so little like the one Mercédès desired , that she turned away to give vent to a sigh , which sounded more like a groan .
“ Thank you , ” she said .
And they walked on again .
They went the whole length of the garden without uttering a word .
“ Sir , ” suddenly exclaimed the countess , after their walk had continued ten minutes in silence , “ is it true that you have seen so much , travelled so far , and suffered so deeply ? ” “ I have suffered deeply , madame , ” answered Monte Cristo .
“ But now you are happy ? ” “ <unk> , ” replied the count , “ since no one hears me complain . ” “ And your present happiness , has it softened your heart ? ” “ My present happiness <unk> my past misery , ” said the count .
“ Are you not married ? ” asked the countess .
“ I , married ? ” exclaimed Monte Cristo , shuddering ; “ who could have told you so ? ” “ No one told me you were , but you have frequently been seen at the Opera with a young and lovely woman . ” “ She is a slave whom I bought at <unk> , madame , the daughter of a prince .
I have adopted her as my daughter , having no one else to love in the world . ” “ You live alone , then ? ” “ I do . ” “ You have no sister — no son — no father ? ” “ I have no one . ” “ How can you exist thus without anyone to attach you to life ? ” “ It is not my fault , madame .
At <unk> , I loved a young girl , was on the point of marrying her , when war came and carried me away .
I thought she loved me well enough to wait for me , and even to remain faithful to my memory .
When I returned she was married .
This is the history of most men who have passed twenty years of age .
Perhaps my heart was <unk> than the hearts of most men , and I suffered more than they would have done in my place ; that is all . ” The countess stopped for a moment , as if <unk> for breath .
“ Yes , ” she said , “ and you have still preserved this love in your heart — one can only love once — and did you ever see her again ? ” <unk> “ Never . ” “ Never ? ” “ I never returned to the country where she lived . ” “ To <unk> ? ” “ Yes ; <unk> . ” “ She is , then , now at <unk> ? ” “ I think so . ” “ And have you <unk> her for all she has made you suffer ? ” “ Her , — yes . ” “ But only her ; do you then still hate those who separated you ? ” “ I hate them ?
Not at all ; why should I ? ” The countess placed herself before Monte Cristo , still holding in her hand a portion of the <unk> <unk> .
“ Take some , ” she said .
“ Madame , I never eat <unk> <unk> , ” replied Monte Cristo , as if the subject had not been mentioned before .
The countess dashed the <unk> into the nearest thicket , with a gesture of despair .
“ <unk> man ! ” she murmured .
Monte Cristo remained as <unk> as if the reproach had not been addressed to him .
Albert at this moment ran in .
“ Oh , mother , ” he exclaimed , “ such a misfortune has happened ! ” “ What ?
What has happened ? ” asked the countess , as though <unk> from a sleep to the realities of life ; “ did you say a misfortune ?
Indeed , I should expect misfortunes . ” “ M.
de Villefort is here . ” “ Well ? ” “ He comes to fetch his wife and daughter . ” “ Why so ? ” “ Because Madame de Saint-Méran is just arrived in Paris , bringing the news of M. de Saint-Méran ’ s death , which took place on the first stage after he left Marseilles .
Madame de Villefort , who was in very good spirits , would neither believe nor think of the misfortune , but Mademoiselle Valentine , at the first words , guessed the whole truth , notwithstanding all the precautions of her father ; the blow struck her like a <unk> , and she fell <unk> . ” “ And how was M. de Saint-Méran related to Mademoiselle de Villefort ? ” said the count .
“ He was her grandfather on the mother ’ s side .
He was coming here to hasten her marriage with Franz . ” “ Ah , indeed ! ” “ So Franz must wait .
Why was not M. de Saint-Méran also grandfather to Mademoiselle Danglars ? ” “ Albert , Albert , ” said Madame de Morcerf , in a tone of <unk> <unk> , “ what are you saying ?
Ah , count , he <unk> you so highly , tell him that he has spoken <unk> . ” And she took two or three steps forward .
Monte Cristo watched her with an air so thoughtful , and so full of affectionate admiration , that she turned back and grasped his hand ; at the same time she seized that of her son , and joined them together .
“ We are friends ; are we not ? ” she asked .
“ Oh , madame , I do not presume to call myself your friend , but at all times I am your most respectful servant . ” The countess left with an indescribable <unk> in her heart , and before she had taken ten steps the count saw her raise her handkerchief to her eyes .
“ Do not my mother and you agree ? ” asked Albert , astonished .
“ On the contrary , ” replied the count , “ did you not hear her declare that we were friends ? ” They re-entered the drawing-room , which Valentine and Madame de Villefort had just quitted .
It is perhaps <unk> to add that Morrel departed almost at the same time .
Chapter <unk> .
Madame de Saint-Méran A gloomy scene had indeed just passed at the house of M. de Villefort .
After the ladies had departed for the ball , whither all the <unk> of Madame de Villefort had failed in <unk> him to accompany them , the procureur had shut himself up in his study , according to his custom , with a heap of papers calculated to alarm anyone else , but which generally scarcely satisfied his <unk> desires .
But this time the papers were a mere matter of form .
Villefort had <unk> himself , not to study , but to reflect ; and with the door locked and orders given that he should not be disturbed excepting for important business , he sat down in his armchair and began to <unk> over the events , the remembrance of which had during the last eight days filled his mind with so many gloomy thoughts and bitter recollections .
Then , instead of <unk> into the mass of documents <unk> before him , he opened the drawer of his desk , touched a spring , and drew out a <unk> of cherished <unk> , amongst which he had carefully arranged , in characters only known to himself , the names of all those who , either in his political career , in money matters , at the bar , or in his mysterious love affairs , had become his enemies .
Their number was formidable , now that he had begun to fear , and yet these names , powerful though they were , had often caused him to smile with the same kind of satisfaction experienced by a traveller who from the summit of a mountain <unk> at his feet the <unk> <unk> , the almost <unk> paths , and the fearful <unk> , through which he has so <unk> <unk> .
When he had run over all these names in his memory , again read and studied them , <unk> meanwhile upon his <unk> , he shook his head .
“ No , ” he murmured , “ none of my enemies would have waited so <unk> and <unk> for so long a space of time , that they might now come and crush me with this secret .
Sometimes , as <unk> says : ‘ <unk> deeds will rise , Though all the earth o ’ <unk> them , to men ’ s eyes ; ’ but , like a <unk> light , they rise but to <unk> .
The story has been told by the Corsican to some priest , who in his turn has repeated it .
M. de Monte Cristo may have heard it , and to <unk> himself — — “ But why should he wish to <unk> himself upon the subject ? ” asked Villefort , after a moment ’ s reflection , “ what interest can this M. de Monte Cristo or M. <unk> , — son of a <unk> of <unk> , <unk> of a mine in <unk> , now visiting Paris for the first time , — what interest , I say , can he take in <unk> a gloomy , mysterious , and useless fact like this ?
However , among all the <unk> details given to me by the Abbé Busoni and by Lord Wilmore , by that friend and that enemy , one thing appears certain and clear in my opinion — that in no period , in no case , in no circumstance , could there have been any contact between him and me . ” But Villefort uttered words which even he himself did not believe .
He dreaded not so much the <unk> , for he could reply to or deny its truth ; — he cared little for that _ <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> _ , which appeared suddenly in letters of blood upon the wall ; — but what he was really anxious for was to discover whose hand had traced them .
While he was endeavoring to calm his fears , — and instead of dwelling upon the political future that had so often been the subject of his <unk> dreams , was <unk> a future limited to the <unk> of home , in fear of <unk> the enemy that had so long slept , — the noise of a carriage sounded in the yard , then he heard the steps of an aged person <unk> the stairs , followed by tears and <unk> , such as servants always give vent to when they wish to appear interested in their master ’ s grief .
He drew back the bolt of his door , and almost directly an old lady entered , <unk> , carrying her shawl on her arm , and her bonnet in her hand .
The white hair was thrown back from her yellow forehead , and her eyes , already <unk> by the <unk> of age , now almost disappeared beneath the eyelids <unk> with grief .
“ Oh , sir , ” she said ; “ oh , sir , what a misfortune !
I shall die of it ; oh , yes , I shall certainly die of it ! ” And then , falling upon the chair nearest the door , she burst into a <unk> of sobs .
The servants , standing in the <unk> , not daring to approach nearer , were looking at Noirtier ’ s old servant , who had heard the noise from his master ’ s room , and run there also , remaining behind the others .
Villefort rose , and ran towards his <unk> , for it was she .
“ Why , what can have happened ? ” he exclaimed , “ what has thus disturbed you ?
Is M. de Saint-Méran with you ? ” “ M.
de Saint-Méran is dead , ” answered the old <unk> , without <unk> and without expression ; she appeared to be stupefied .
Villefort drew back , and <unk> his hands together , exclaimed : “ <unk> ! — so suddenly ? ” “ A week ago , ” continued Madame de Saint-Méran , “ we went out together in the carriage after dinner .
M. de Saint-Méran had been <unk> for some days ; still , the idea of seeing our dear Valentine again inspired him with courage , and notwithstanding his illness he would leave .
At six leagues from Marseilles , after having eaten some of the <unk> he is accustomed to take , he fell into such a deep sleep , that it appeared to me <unk> ; still I hesitated to wake him , although I fancied that his face was <unk> , and that the veins of his <unk> <unk> more violently than usual .
However , as it became dark , and I could no longer see , I fell asleep ; I was soon aroused by a piercing <unk> , as from a person suffering in his dreams , and he suddenly threw his head back violently .
I called the valet , I stopped the <unk> , I spoke to M. de Saint-Méran , I applied my <unk> ; but all was over , and I arrived at <unk> by the side of a corpse . ” Villefort stood with his mouth half open , quite stupefied .
“ Of course you sent for a doctor ? ” “ <unk> ; but , as I have told you , it was too late . ” “ Yes ; but then he could tell of what complaint the poor marquis had died . ” “ Oh , yes , sir , he told me ; it appears to have been an <unk> stroke . ” “ And what did you do then ? ” “ M.
de Saint-Méran had always expressed a desire , in case his death happened during his absence from Paris , that his body might be brought to the family vault .
I had him put into a <unk> coffin , and I am preceding him by a few days . ” “ Oh !
my poor mother ! ” said Villefort , “ to have such duties to perform at your age after such a blow ! ” “ God has supported me through all ; and then , my dear marquis , he would certainly have done everything for me that I performed for him .
It is true that since I left him , I seem to have lost my senses .
I cannot cry ; at my age they say that we have no more tears , — still I think that when one is in trouble one should have the power of weeping .
Where is Valentine , sir ?
It is on her account I am here ; I wish to see Valentine . ” <unk> Villefort thought it would be terrible to reply that Valentine was at a ball ; so he only said that she had gone out with her <unk> , and that she should be <unk> .
“ This instant , sir — this instant , I <unk> you ! ” said the old lady .
Villefort placed the arm of Madame de Saint-Méran within his own , and conducted her to his apartment .
“ <unk> yourself , mother , ” he said .
The <unk> raised her head at this word , and <unk> the man who so <unk> reminded her of her <unk> child , who still lived for her in Valentine , she felt touched at the name of mother , and <unk> into tears , she fell on her knees before an armchair , where she buried her venerable head .
Villefort left her to the care of the women , while old Barrois ran , <unk> , to his master ; for nothing <unk> old people so much as when death <unk> its <unk> over them for a moment in order to strike some other old person .
Then , while Madame de Saint-Méran remained on her knees , praying <unk> , Villefort sent for a cab , and went himself to fetch his wife and daughter from Madame de Morcerf ’ s .
He was so pale when he appeared at the door of the <unk> , that Valentine ran to him , saying : “ Oh , father , some misfortune has happened ! ” “ Your <unk> has just arrived , Valentine , ” said M. de Villefort .
“ And grandpapa ? ” inquired the young girl , trembling with apprehension .
M. de Villefort only replied by offering his arm to his daughter .
It was just in time , for Valentine ’ s head <unk> , and she <unk> ; Madame de Villefort instantly hastened to her assistance , and <unk> her husband in dragging her to the carriage , saying : “ What a singular event !
Who could have thought it ?
Ah , yes , it is indeed strange ! ” And the wretched family departed , leaving a cloud of sadness hanging over the rest of the evening .
At the foot of the stairs , Valentine found Barrois awaiting her .
“ M.
Noirtier wishes to see you tonight , he said , in an <unk> .
“ Tell him I will come when I leave my dear <unk> , ” she replied , feeling , with true delicacy , that the person to whom she could be of the most service just then was Madame de Saint-Méran .
Valentine found her grandmother in bed ; silent <unk> , <unk> sobs , broken <unk> , burning tears , were all that passed in this sad interview , while Madame de Villefort , leaning on her husband ’ s arm , <unk> all <unk> forms of respect , at least towards the poor widow .
She soon whispered to her husband : “ I think it would be better for me to retire , with your permission , for the sight of me appears still to <unk> your <unk> . ” Madame de Saint-Méran heard her .
“ Yes , yes , ” she said softly to Valentine , “ let her leave ; but do you stay . ” Madame de Villefort left , and Valentine remained alone beside the bed , for the procureur , overcome with astonishment at the unexpected death , had followed his wife .
Meanwhile , Barrois had returned for the first time to old Noirtier , who having heard the noise in the house , had , as we have said , sent his old servant to inquire the cause ; on his return , his quick intelligent eye <unk> the messenger .
“ Alas , sir , ” exclaimed Barrois , “ a great misfortune has happened .
Madame de Saint-Méran has arrived , and her husband is dead ! ” M. de Saint-Méran and Noirtier had never been on strict terms of friendship ; still , the death of one old man always <unk> <unk> another .
Noirtier let his head fall upon his chest , apparently overwhelmed and thoughtful ; then he closed one eye , in <unk> of inquiry .
Barrois asked , “ Mademoiselle Valentine ? ” Noirtier nodded his head .
“ She is at the ball , as you know , since she came to say <unk> to you in full dress . ” Noirtier again closed his left eye .
“ Do you wish to see her ? ” Noirtier again made an <unk> sign .
“ Well , they have gone to fetch her , no doubt , from Madame de Morcerf ’ s ; I will await her return , and beg her to come up here .
Is that what you wish for ? ” “ Yes , ” replied the invalid .
Barrois , therefore , as we have seen , watched for Valentine , and informed her of her grandfather ’ s wish .
<unk> , Valentine came up to Noirtier , on leaving Madame de Saint-Méran , who in the midst of her grief had at last yielded to fatigue and fallen into a feverish sleep .
<unk> reach of her hand they placed a small table upon which stood a bottle of <unk> , her usual <unk> , and a glass .
Then , as we have said , the young girl left the <unk> to see M. Noirtier .
Valentine kissed the old man , who looked at her with such tenderness that her eyes again filled with tears , whose <unk> he thought must be exhausted .
The old gentleman continued to dwell upon her with the same expression .
“ Yes , yes , ” said Valentine , “ you mean that I have yet a kind grandfather left , do you not . ” The old man <unk> that such was his meaning .
“ Ah , yes , happily I have , ” replied Valentine .
“ Without that , what would become of me ? ” It was one o ’ clock in the morning .
Barrois , who wished to go to bed himself , observed that after such sad events everyone stood in need of rest .
Noirtier would not say that the only rest he needed was to see his child , but wished her <unk> , for grief and fatigue had made her appear quite ill .
The next morning she found her grandmother in bed ; the fever had not <unk> , on the contrary her eyes <unk> and she appeared to be suffering from violent nervous <unk> .
“ Oh , dear <unk> , are you worse ? ” exclaimed Valentine , perceiving all these signs of agitation .
“ No , my child , no , ” said Madame de Saint-Méran ; “ but I was impatiently waiting for your arrival , that I might send for your father . ” “ My father ? ” inquired Valentine , <unk> .
“ Yes , I wish to speak to him . ” Valentine <unk> not oppose her grandmother ’ s wish , the cause of which she did not know , and an instant afterwards Villefort entered .
“ Sir , ” said Madame de Saint-Méran , without using any <unk> , and as if fearing she had no time to lose , “ you wrote to me concerning the marriage of this child ? ” “ Yes , madame , ” replied Villefort , “ it is not only projected but arranged . ” “ Your intended <unk> is named M. Franz d ’ Épinay ? ” “ Yes , madame . ” “ Is he not the son of General d ’ Épinay who was on our side , and who was assassinated some days before the usurper returned from the Island of Elba ? ” “ The same . ” “ Does he not dislike the idea of marrying the <unk> of a <unk> ? ” “ Our civil <unk> are now happily extinguished , mother , ” said Villefort ; “ M.
d ’ Épinay was quite a child when his father died , he knows very little of M. Noirtier , and will meet him , if not with pleasure , at least with indifference . ” “ Is it a suitable match ? ” “ In every respect . ” “ And the young man ? ” “ Is regarded with universal esteem . ” “ You approve of him ? ” “ He is one of the most <unk> young men I know . ” During the whole of this conversation Valentine had remained silent .
“ Well , sir , ” said Madame de Saint-Méran , after a few minutes ’ reflection , “ I must hasten the marriage , for I have but a short time to live . ” “ You , madame ? ” “ You , dear <unk> ? ” exclaimed M. de Villefort and Valentine at the same time .
“ I know what I am saying , ” continued the <unk> ; “ I must hurry you , so that , as she has no mother , she may at least have a grandmother to bless her marriage .
I am all that is left to her belonging to my poor Renée , whom you have so soon forgotten , sir . ” “ Ah , madame , ” said Villefort , “ you forget that I was obliged to give a mother to my child . ” “ A <unk> is never a mother , sir .
But this is not to the purpose , — our business concerns Valentine , let us leave the dead in peace . ” All this was said with such <unk> rapidity , that there was something in the conversation that seemed like the beginning of delirium .
“ It shall be as you wish , madame , ” said Villefort ; “ more especially since your wishes <unk> with mine , and as soon as M. d ’ Épinay arrives in Paris — — ” <unk> “ My dear grandmother , ” interrupted Valentine , “ consider <unk> — the recent death .
You would not have me marry under such sad <unk> ? ” “ My child , ” exclaimed the old lady <unk> , “ let us hear none of the <unk> objections that <unk> weak minds from preparing for the future .
I also was married at the <unk> of my mother , and certainly I have not been less happy on that account . ” “ Still that idea of death , madame , ” said Villefort .
“ Still ? — <unk> !
I tell you I am going to die — do you understand ?
Well , before dying , I wish to see my <unk> .
I wish to tell him to make my child happy ; I wish to read in his eyes whether he <unk> to obey me ; — in fact , I will know him — I will ! ” continued the old lady , with a fearful expression , “ that I may rise from the depths of my grave to find him , if he should not fulfil his duty ! ” “ Madame , ” said Villefort , “ you must lay aside these <unk> ideas , which almost assume the appearance of madness .
The dead , once buried in their <unk> , rise no more . ” “ And I tell you , sir , that you are mistaken .
This night I have had a fearful sleep .
It seemed as though my soul were already <unk> over my body , my eyes , which I tried to open , closed against my will , and what will appear impossible above all to you , sir , I saw , with my eyes shut , in the spot where you are now standing , <unk> from that corner where there is a door leading into Madame Villefort ’ s dressing-room — I saw , I tell you , silently enter , a white figure . ” Valentine <unk> .
“ It was the fever that disturbed you , madame , ” said Villefort .
<unk> “ <unk> , if you please , but I am sure of what I say .
I saw a white figure , and as if to prevent my <unk> the <unk> of only one of my senses , I heard my glass removed — the same which is there now on the table . ” “ Oh , dear mother , it was a dream . ” “ So little was it a dream , that I stretched my hand towards the bell ; but when I did so , the shade disappeared ; my maid then entered with a light . ” “ But she saw no one ? ” “ <unk> are visible to those only who ought to see them .
It was the soul of my husband ! — Well , if my husband ’ s soul can come to me , why should not my soul <unk> to guard my <unk> ?
the <unk> is even more direct , it seems to me . ” “ Oh , madame , ” said Villefort , deeply affected , in spite of himself , “ do not yield to those gloomy thoughts ; you will long live with us , happy , loved , and <unk> , and we will make you forget — — ” “ Never , never , never , ” said the <unk> .
“ When does M. d ’ Épinay return ? ” “ We expect him every moment . ” “ It is well .
As soon as he arrives inform me .
We must be <unk> .
And then I also wish to see a notary , that I may be assured that all our property returns to Valentine . ” “ Ah , <unk> , ” murmured Valentine , pressing her lips on the burning brow , “ do you wish to kill me ?
Oh , how feverish you are ; we must not send for a notary , but for a doctor ! ” “ A doctor ? ” said she , <unk> her shoulders , “ I am not ill ; I am <unk> — that is all . ” <unk> “ What are you drinking , dear <unk> ? ” “ The same as usual , my dear , my glass is there on the table — give it to me , Valentine . ” Valentine poured the <unk> into a glass and gave it to her grandmother with a certain degree of dread , for it was the same glass she fancied that had been touched by the spectre .
The <unk> <unk> the glass at a single draught , and then turned on her pillow , <unk> , “ The notary , the notary ! ” M. de Villefort left the room , and Valentine seated herself at the <unk> of her grandmother .
The poor child appeared herself to require the doctor she had recommended to her aged relative .
A bright spot burned in either cheek , her <unk> was short and difficult , and her pulse beat with feverish excitement .
She was thinking of the despair of Maximilian , when he should be informed that Madame de Saint-Méran , instead of being an <unk> , was unconsciously acting as his enemy .
More than once she thought of <unk> all to her grandmother , and she would not have hesitated a moment , if Maximilian Morrel had been named Albert de Morcerf or <unk> de Château-Renaud ; but Morrel was of <unk> <unk> , and Valentine knew how the haughty <unk> de Saint-Méran <unk> all who were not noble .
Her secret had each time been <unk> when she was about to reveal it , by the sad conviction that it would be useless to do so ; for , were it once discovered by her father and mother , all would be lost .
Two hours passed thus ; Madame de Saint-Méran was in a feverish sleep , and the notary had arrived .
Though his coming was announced in a very low tone , Madame de Saint-Méran arose from her pillow .
“ The notary ! ” she exclaimed , “ let him come in . ” The notary , who was at the door , immediately entered .
“ Go , Valentine , ” said Madame de Saint-Méran , “ and leave me with this gentleman . ” “ But , <unk> — — ” “ Leave me — go ! ” The young girl kissed her grandmother , and left with her handkerchief to her eyes ; at the door she found the valet de chambre , who told her that the doctor was waiting in the dining-room .
Valentine instantly ran down .
The doctor was a friend of the family , and at the same time one of the <unk> men of the day , and very fond of Valentine , whose birth he had witnessed .
He had himself a daughter about her age , but whose life was one continued source of anxiety and fear to him from her mother having been <unk> .
“ Oh , ” said Valentine , “ we have been waiting for you with such impatience , dear M. d ’ Avrigny .
But , first of all , how are Madeleine and <unk> ? ” Madeleine was the daughter of M. d ’ Avrigny , and <unk> his niece .
M. d ’ Avrigny smiled sadly .
“ <unk> is very well , ” he said , “ and Madeleine tolerably so .
But you sent for me , my dear child .
It is not your father or Madame de Villefort who is ill . As for you , although we <unk> cannot <unk> our <unk> of nerves , I fancy you have no further need of me than to recommend you not to allow your imagination to take too wide a field . ” Valentine <unk> .
M. d ’ Avrigny carried the science of <unk> almost to a <unk> extent , for he was one of the <unk> who always work upon the body through the mind .
<unk> “ No , ” she replied , “ it is for my poor grandmother .
You know the <unk> that has happened to us , do you not ? ” “ I know nothing . ” said M. d ’ Avrigny .
“ Alas , ” said Valentine , <unk> her tears , “ my grandfather is dead . ” “ M.
de Saint-Méran ? ” “ Yes . ” “ Suddenly ? ” “ From an <unk> stroke . ” “ An <unk> stroke ? ” repeated the doctor .
“ Yes , and my poor grandmother fancies that her husband , whom she never left , has called her , and that she must go and join him .
Oh , M. d ’ Avrigny , I <unk> you , do something for her ! ” “ Where is she ? ” “ In her room with the notary . ” “ And M. Noirtier ? ” “ Just as he was , his mind perfectly clear , but the same <unk> of moving or speaking . ” “ And the same love for you — <unk> , my dear child ? ” “ Yes , ” said Valentine , “ he was very fond of me . ” “ Who does not love you ? ” Valentine smiled sadly .
“ What are your grandmother ’ s symptoms ? ” “ An extreme nervous excitement and a strangely agitated sleep ; she fancied this morning in her sleep that her soul was <unk> above her body , which she at the same time watched .
It must have been delirium ; she fancies , too , that she saw a phantom enter her chamber and even heard the noise it made on touching her glass . ” “ It is singular , ” said the doctor ; “ I was not aware that Madame de Saint-Méran was subject to such <unk> . ” “ It is the first time I ever saw her in this condition , ” said Valentine ; “ and this morning she frightened me so that I thought her mad ; and my father , who you know is a <unk> man , himself appeared deeply impressed . ” “ We will go and see , ” said the doctor ; “ what you tell me seems very strange . ” The notary here descended , and Valentine was informed that her grandmother was alone .
“ Go upstairs , ” she said to the doctor .
“ And you ? ” “ Oh , I dare not — she <unk> my sending for you ; and , as you say , I am myself agitated , feverish and out of sorts .
I will go and take a turn in the garden to recover myself . ” The doctor pressed Valentine ’ s hand , and while he visited her grandmother , she descended the steps .
We need not say which portion of the garden was her favorite walk .
After remaining for a short time in the <unk> <unk> the house , and <unk> a rose to place in her waist or hair , she turned into the dark <unk> which led to the bench ; then from the bench she went to the gate .
As usual , Valentine <unk> for a short time among her flowers , but without <unk> them .
The mourning in her heart <unk> her <unk> this simple <unk> , though she had not yet had time to put on the <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
<unk> She then turned towards the <unk> .
As she advanced she fancied she heard a voice speaking her name .
She stopped astonished , then the voice reached her ear more distinctly , and she recognized it to be that of Maximilian .
Chapter <unk> .
The <unk> It was indeed Maximilian Morrel , who had passed a wretched existence since the previous day .
With the instinct peculiar to lovers he had anticipated after the return of Madame de Saint-Méran and the death of the marquis , that something would occur at M. de Villefort ’ s in connection with his attachment for Valentine .
His <unk> were realized , as we shall see , and his uneasy <unk> had <unk> him pale and trembling to the gate under the <unk> .
Valentine was ignorant of the cause of this sorrow and anxiety , and as it was not his accustomed hour for visiting her , she had gone to the spot simply by accident or perhaps through sympathy .
Morrel called her , and she ran to the gate .
“ You here at this hour ? ” said she .
“ Yes , my poor girl , ” replied Morrel ; “ I come to bring and to hear bad <unk> . ” “ This is , indeed , a house of mourning , ” said Valentine ; “ speak , Maximilian , although the cup of sorrow seems already full . ” “ Dear Valentine , ” said Morrel , endeavoring to conceal his own emotion , “ listen , I entreat you ; what I am about to say is very serious .
When are you to be married ? ” “ I will tell you all , ” said Valentine ; “ from you I have nothing to conceal .
This morning the subject was introduced , and my dear grandmother , on whom I depended as my only support , not only declared herself favorable to it , but is so anxious for it , that they only await the arrival of M. d ’ Épinay , and the following day the contract will be signed . ” A deep sigh escaped the young man , who gazed long and <unk> at her he loved .
“ Alas , ” replied he , “ it is dreadful thus to hear my <unk> from your own lips .
The sentence is passed , and , in a few hours , will be executed ; it must be so , and I will not endeavor to prevent it .
But , since you say nothing remains but for M. d ’ Épinay to arrive that the contract may be signed , and the following day you will be his , tomorrow you will be engaged to M. d ’ Épinay , for he came this morning to Paris . ” Valentine uttered a cry .
“ I was at the house of Monte Cristo an hour since , ” said Morrel ; “ we were speaking , he of the sorrow your family had experienced , and I of your grief , when a carriage rolled into the courtyard .
Never , till then , had I placed any confidence in <unk> , but now I cannot help believing them , Valentine .
At the sound of that carriage I shuddered ; soon I heard steps on the staircase , which terrified me as much as the footsteps of the <unk> did Don <unk> .
The door at last opened ; Albert de Morcerf entered first , and I began to hope my fears were vain , when , after him , another young man advanced , and the count exclaimed : ‘ Ah , here is the Baron Franz d ’ Épinay ! ’ I summoned all my strength and courage to my support .
Perhaps I turned pale and trembled , but certainly I smiled ; and five minutes after I left , without having heard one word that had passed . ” “ Poor Maximilian ! ” murmured Valentine .
“ Valentine , the time has arrived when you must answer me .
And remember my life depends on your answer .
What do you intend doing ? ” Valentine held down her head ; she was overwhelmed .
“ Listen , ” said Morrel ; “ it is not the first time you have contemplated our present position , which is a serious and <unk> one ; I do not think it is a moment to give way to useless sorrow ; leave that for those who like to suffer at their leisure and indulge their grief in secret .
There are such in the world , and God will doubtless <unk> them in heaven for their resignation on earth , but those who mean to <unk> must not lose one precious moment , but must return immediately the blow which fortune strikes .
Do you intend to struggle against our <unk> ?
Tell me , Valentine for it is that I came to know . ” Valentine trembled , and looked at him with amazement .
The idea of <unk> her father , her grandmother , and all the family , had never occurred to her .
“ What do you say , Maximilian ? ” asked Valentine .
“ What do you mean by a struggle ?
Oh , it would be a <unk> .
What ?
I resist my father ’ s order , and my dying grandmother ’ s wish ?
Impossible ! ” Morrel started .
“ You are too noble not to understand me , and you understand me so well that you already yield , dear Maximilian .
No , no ; I shall need all my strength to struggle with myself and support my grief in secret , as you say .
But to <unk> my father — to disturb my grandmother ’ s last moments — never ! ” “ You are right , ” said Morrel , calmly .
“ In what a tone you speak ! ” cried Valentine .
“ I speak as one who <unk> you , mademoiselle . ” “ Mademoiselle , ” cried Valentine ; “ mademoiselle !
Oh , selfish man !
he sees me in despair , and <unk> he cannot understand me ! ” “ You mistake — I understand you perfectly .
You will not oppose M. Villefort , you will not <unk> the <unk> , and tomorrow you will sign the contract which will <unk> you to your husband . ” “ But , _ <unk> Dieu ! _ tell me , how can I do otherwise ? ” “ Do not appeal to me , mademoiselle ; I shall be a bad judge in such a case ; my selfishness will blind me , ” replied Morrel , whose low voice and clenched hands announced his growing <unk> .
“ What would you have proposed , Maximilian , had you found me willing to <unk> ? ” “ It is not for me to say . ” “ You are wrong ; you must advise me what to do . ” “ Do you seriously ask my advice , Valentine ? ” “ Certainly , dear Maximilian , for if it is good , I will follow it ; you know my devotion to you . ” “ Valentine , ” said Morrel <unk> aside a loose <unk> , “ give me your hand in <unk> of <unk> of my anger ; my senses are confused , and during the last hour the most <unk> thoughts have passed through my brain .
Oh , if you refuse my advice — — ” “ What do you advise ? ” said Valentine , raising her eyes to heaven and <unk> .
“ I am free , ” replied Maximilian , “ and rich enough to support you .
I swear to make you my <unk> wife before my lips even shall have approached your forehead . ” “ You make me tremble ! ” said the young girl .
“ <unk> me , ” said Morrel ; “ I will take you to my sister , who is worthy also to be yours .
We will <unk> for <unk> , for England , for <unk> , or , if you prefer it , retire to the country and only return to Paris when our friends have <unk> your family . ” Valentine shook her head .
“ I feared it , Maximilian , ” said she ; “ it is the counsel of a madman , and I should be more mad than you , did I not stop you at once with the word ‘ Impossible , Morrel , impossible ! ’ ” “ You will then submit to what fate <unk> for you without even <unk> to <unk> with it ? ” said Morrel <unk> .
“ Yes , — if I die ! ” “ Well , Valentine , ” resumed Maximilian , “ I can only say again that you are right .
<unk> , it is I who am mad , and you prove to me that passion <unk> the most <unk> .
I <unk> your calm reasoning .
It is then understood that tomorrow you will be <unk> promised to M. Franz d ’ Épinay , not only by that <unk> <unk> invented to <unk> the effect of a <unk> called the signature of the contract , but your own will ? ” “ Again you drive me to despair , Maximilian , ” said Valentine , “ again you <unk> the <unk> into the wound !
What would you do , tell me , if your sister listened to such a <unk> ? ” “ Mademoiselle , ” replied Morrel with a bitter smile , “ I am selfish — you have already said so — and as a selfish man I think not of what others would do in my situation , but of what I intend doing myself .
I think only that I have known you not a whole year .
From the day I first saw you , all my hopes of happiness have been in <unk> your affection .
One day you acknowledged that you loved me , and since that day my hope of future happiness has rested on obtaining you , for to gain you would be life to me .
Now , I think no more ; I say only that fortune has turned against me — I had thought to gain heaven , and now I have lost it .
It is an <unk> <unk> for a <unk> to lose not only what he possesses but also what he has not . ” Morrel pronounced these words with perfect calmness ; Valentine looked at him a moment with her large , <unk> eyes , endeavoring not to let Morrel discover the grief which struggled in her heart .
“ But , in a word , what are you going to do ? ” asked she .
“ I am going to have the honor of taking my leave of you , mademoiselle , solemnly <unk> you that I wish your life may be so calm , so happy , and so fully occupied , that there may be no place for me even in your memory . ” “ Oh ! ” murmured Valentine .
“ Adieu , Valentine , adieu ! ” said Morrel , bowing .
“ Where are you going ? ” cried the young girl , extending her hand through the opening , and seizing Maximilian by his coat , for she understood from her own agitated feelings that her lover ’ s calmness could not be real ; “ where are you going ? ” “ I am going , that I may not bring fresh trouble into your family : and to set an example which every honest and devoted man , situated as I am , may follow . ” “ Before you leave me , tell me what you are going to do , Maximilian . ” The young man smiled <unk> .
“ Speak , speak ! ” said Valentine ; “ I entreat you . ” “ Has your resolution changed , Valentine ? ” “ It cannot change , unhappy man ; you know it must not ! ” cried the young girl .
“ Then adieu , Valentine ! ” Valentine shook the gate with a strength of which she could not have been supposed to be possessed , as Morrel was going away , and passing both her hands through the opening , she clasped and <unk> them .
“ I must know what you mean to do ! ” said she .
“ Where are you going ? ” “ Oh , fear not , ” said Maximilian , stopping at a short distance , “ I do not intend to render another man <unk> for the <unk> fate reserved for me .
Another might <unk> to seek M. Franz , to <unk> him , and to fight with him ; all that would be folly .
What has M. Franz to do with it ?
He saw me this morning for the first time , and has already forgotten he has seen me .
He did not even know I existed when it was arranged by your two families that you should be united .
I have no <unk> against M. Franz , and promise you the punishment shall not fall on him . ” “ On whom , then ! — on me ? ” “ On you ?
Valentine !
Oh , Heaven <unk> !
<unk> is sacred ; the woman one loves is holy . ” “ On yourself , then , unhappy man ; on yourself ? ” “ I am the only guilty person , am I not ? ” said Maximilian .
“ Maximilian ! ” said Valentine , “ Maximilian , come back , I entreat you ! ” He drew near with his sweet smile , and but for his <unk> one might have thought him in his usual happy <unk> .
“ Listen , my dear , my adored Valentine , ” said he in his <unk> and grave tone ; “ those who , like us , have never had a thought for which we need blush before the world , such may read each other ’ s hearts .
I never was romantic , and am no melancholy hero .
I <unk> neither <unk> nor <unk> ; but without words , <unk> , or <unk> , my life has <unk> itself with yours ; you leave me , and you are right in doing so , — I repeat it , you are right ; but in losing you , I lose my life .
The moment you leave me , Valentine , I am alone in the world .
My sister is happily married ; her husband is only my <unk> , that is , a man whom the <unk> of social life alone attach to me ; no one then longer needs my useless life .
This is what I shall do ; I will wait until the very moment you are married , for I will not lose the shadow of one of those unexpected chances which are sometimes reserved for us , since M. Franz may , after all , die before that time , a <unk> may fall even on the altar as you approach it , — nothing appears impossible to one condemned to die , and <unk> appear quite reasonable when his escape from death is concerned .
I will , then , wait until the last moment , and when my misery is certain , <unk> , <unk> , I will write a <unk> letter to my <unk> , another to the prefect of police , to <unk> them with my intention , and at the corner of some wood , on the brink of some abyss , on the bank of some river , I will put an end to my existence , as certainly as I am the son of the most honest man who ever lived in France . ” <unk> Valentine trembled convulsively ; she <unk> her hold of the gate , her arms fell by her side , and two large tears rolled down her cheeks .
The young man stood before her , sorrowful and resolute .
“ Oh , for pity ’ s sake , ” said she , “ you will live , will you not ? ” “ No , on my honor , ” said Maximilian ; “ but that will not affect you .
You have done your duty , and your conscience will be at rest . ” Valentine fell on her knees , and pressed her almost <unk> heart .
“ Maximilian , ” said she , “ Maximilian , my friend , my brother on earth , my true husband in heaven , I entreat you , do as I do , live in suffering ; perhaps we may one day be united . ” “ Adieu , Valentine , ” repeated Morrel .
“ My God , ” said Valentine , raising both her hands to heaven with a sublime expression , “ I have done my utmost to remain a <unk> daughter ; I have begged , <unk> , <unk> ; he has regarded neither my prayers , my <unk> , nor my tears .
It is done , ” cried she , <unk> away her tears , and <unk> her <unk> , “ I am resolved not to die of remorse , but rather of shame .
<unk> , Maximilian , and I will be yours .
Say when shall it be ?
Speak , command , I will obey . ” Morrel , who had already gone some few steps away , again returned , and pale with joy extended both hands towards Valentine through the opening .
“ Valentine , ” said he , “ dear Valentine , you must not speak thus — rather let me die .
Why should I obtain you by violence , if our love is mutual ?
Is it from mere humanity you <unk> me live ?
I would then rather die . ” “ <unk> , ” murmured Valentine , “ who on this earth cares for me , if he does not ?
Who has <unk> me in my sorrow but he ?
On whom do my hopes rest ?
On whom does my bleeding heart repose ?
On him , on him , always on him !
Yes , you are right , Maximilian , I will follow you .
I will leave the paternal home , I will give up all .
Oh , <unk> girl that I am , ” cried Valentine , <unk> , “ I will give up all , even my dear old grandfather , whom I had nearly forgotten . ” “ No , ” said Maximilian , “ you shall not leave him .
M. Noirtier has <unk> , you say , a kind feeling towards me .
Well , before you leave , tell him all ; his consent would be your <unk> in God ’ s sight .
As soon as we are married , he shall come and live with us , instead of one child , he shall have two .
You have told me how you talk to him and how he <unk> you ; I shall very soon learn that language by signs , Valentine , and I promise you solemnly , that instead of despair , it is happiness that <unk> us . ” “ Oh , see , Maximilian , see the power you have over me , you almost make me believe you ; and yet , what you tell me is madness , for my father will <unk> me — he is <unk> — he will never pardon me .
Now listen to me , Maximilian ; if by <unk> , by <unk> , by accident — in short , if by any means I can delay this marriage , will you wait ? ” “ Yes , I promise you , as <unk> as you have promised me that this horrible marriage shall not take place , and that if you are dragged before a magistrate or a priest , you will refuse . ” “ I promise you by all that is most sacred to me in the world , <unk> , by my mother . ” “ We will wait , then , ” said Morrel .
“ Yes , we will wait , ” replied Valentine , who <unk> at these words ; “ there are so many things which may save unhappy beings such as we are . ” “ I rely on you , Valentine , ” said Morrel ; “ all you do will be well done ; only if they <unk> your prayers , if your father and Madame de Saint-Méran insist that M. d ’ Épinay should be called tomorrow to sign the contract — — ” “ Then you have my promise , Maximilian . ” “ <unk> of <unk> — — ” “ I will go to you , and we will fly ; but from this moment until then , let us not <unk> Providence , let us not see each other .
It is a miracle , it is a <unk> that we have not been discovered .
If we were surprised , if it were known that we met thus , we should have no further resource . ” “ You are right , Valentine ; but how shall I ascertain ? ” “ From the notary , M. <unk> . ” “ I know him . ” “ And for myself — I will write to you , depend on me .
I dread this marriage , Maximilian , as much as you . ” “ Thank you , my adored Valentine , thank you ; that is enough .
When once I know the hour , I will hasten to this spot , you can easily get over this fence with my assistance , a carriage will await us at the gate , in which you will accompany me to my sister ’ s ; there living , retired or <unk> in society , as you wish , we shall be enabled to use our power to resist <unk> , and not suffer ourselves to be put to death like <unk> , which only defend themselves by <unk> . ” “ Yes , ” said Valentine , “ I will now acknowledge you are right , Maximilian ; and now are you satisfied with your <unk> ? ” said the young girl <unk> .
“ My adored Valentine , words cannot express one half of my satisfaction . ” Valentine had approached , or rather , had placed her lips so near the fence , that they nearly touched those of Morrel , which were pressed against the other side of the cold and <unk> barrier .
“ Adieu , then , till we meet again , ” said Valentine , tearing herself away .
“ I shall hear from you ? ” “ Yes . ” “ Thanks , thanks , dear love , adieu ! ” The sound of a kiss was heard , and Valentine fled through the <unk> .
Morrel listened to catch the last sound of her dress <unk> the branches , and of her <unk> on the <unk> , then raised his eyes with an ineffable smile of <unk> to heaven for being permitted to be thus loved , and then also disappeared .
The young man returned home and waited all the evening and all the next day without getting any message .
It was only on the following day , at about ten o ’ clock in the morning , as he was starting to call on M. <unk> , the notary , that he received from the <unk> a small <unk> , which he knew to be from Valentine , although he had not before seen her writing .
It was to this effect : “ <unk> , <unk> , prayers , have <unk> me nothing .
<unk> , for two hours , I was at the church of <unk> , and for two hours I <unk> most <unk> .
Heaven is as <unk> as man , and the signature of the contract is fixed for this evening at nine o ’ clock .
I have but one promise and but one heart to give ; that promise is <unk> to you , that heart is also yours .
This evening , then , at a quarter to nine at the gate .
“ Your betrothed , “ Valentine de Villefort . ” “ <unk> — My poor grandmother gets worse and worse ; yesterday her fever <unk> to delirium ; today her delirium is almost madness .
You will be very kind to me , will you not , Morrel , to make me forget my sorrow in leaving her thus ?
I think it is kept a secret from grandpapa Noirtier , that the contract is to be signed this evening . ” Morrel went also to the notary , who confirmed the news that the contract was to be signed that evening .
Then he went to call on Monte Cristo and heard still more .
Franz had been to announce the ceremony , and Madame de Villefort had also written to beg the count to excuse her not <unk> him ; the death of M. de Saint-Méran and the dangerous illness of his widow would cast a gloom over the meeting which she would regret should be shared by the count whom she wished every happiness .
The day before Franz had been presented to Madame de Saint-Méran , who had left her bed to receive him , but had been obliged to return to it immediately after .
It is easy to suppose that Morrel ’ s agitation would not escape the count ’ s penetrating eye .
Monte Cristo was more affectionate than ever , — indeed , his manner was so kind that several times Morrel was on the point of telling him all .
But he recalled the promise he had made to Valentine , and kept his secret .
The young man read Valentine ’ s letter twenty times in the course of the day .
It was her first , and on what an occasion !
Each time he read it he renewed his <unk> to make her happy .
How great is the power of a woman who has made so <unk> a resolution !
What devotion does she deserve from him for whom she has <unk> everything !
How ought she really to be <unk> loved !
She becomes at once a <unk> and a wife , and it is impossible to thank and love her sufficiently .
Morrel longed <unk> for the moment when he should hear Valentine say , “ Here I am , Maximilian ; come and help me . ” He had arranged everything for her escape ; two <unk> were hidden in the <unk> ; a cabriolet was ordered for Maximilian alone , without a servant , without lights ; at the turning of the first street they would light the lamps , as it would be foolish to attract the notice of the police by too many precautions .
<unk> he shuddered ; he thought of the moment when , from the top of that wall , he should protect the descent of his dear Valentine , pressing in his arms for the first time her of whom he had yet only kissed the delicate hand .
When the afternoon arrived and he felt that the hour was drawing near , he wished for solitude , his agitation was extreme ; a simple question from a friend would have irritated him .
He shut himself in his room , and tried to read , but his eye glanced over the page without understanding a word , and he threw away the book , and for the second time sat down to <unk> his plan , the <unk> and the fence .
At length the hour drew near .
Never did a man deeply in love allow the <unk> to go on <unk> .
Morrel <unk> his so <unk> that they struck eight at half-past six .
He then said , “ It is time to start ; the signature was indeed fixed to take place at nine o ’ clock , but perhaps Valentine will not wait for that . ” <unk> , Morrel , having left the Rue <unk> at half-past eight by his <unk> , entered the <unk> while the clock of <unk> was striking eight .
The horse and cabriolet were concealed behind a small ruin , where Morrel had often waited .
The night gradually drew on , and the <unk> in the garden assumed a deeper hue .
Then Morrel came out from his <unk> with a beating heart , and looked through the small opening in the gate ; there was yet no one to be seen .
The clock struck half-past eight , and still another <unk> was passed in waiting , while Morrel walked to and fro , and gazed more and more frequently through the opening .
The garden became <unk> still , but in the darkness he looked in vain for the white dress , and in the silence he <unk> listened for the sound of footsteps .
The house , which was <unk> through the trees , remained in darkness , and gave no <unk> that so important an event as the signature of a <unk> was going on .
Morrel looked at his watch , which wanted a quarter to ten ; but soon the same clock he had already heard strike two or three times <unk> the error by striking half-past nine .
This was already half an hour past the time Valentine had fixed .
It was a terrible moment for the young man .
The slightest <unk> of the <unk> , the least <unk> of the wind , attracted his attention , and drew the perspiration to his brow ; then he <unk> fixed his ladder , and , not to lose a moment , placed his foot on the first step .
<unk> all these <unk> of hope and fear , the clock struck ten .
“ It is impossible , ” said Maximilian , “ that the <unk> of a contract should occupy so long a time without unexpected <unk> .
I have weighed all the chances , calculated the time required for all the forms ; something must have happened . ” And then he walked rapidly to and fro , and pressed his burning forehead against the fence .
Had Valentine fainted ?
or had she been discovered and stopped in her flight ?
These were the only <unk> which appeared possible to the young man .
The idea that her strength had failed her in <unk> to escape , and that she had fainted in one of the paths , was the one that most impressed itself upon his mind .
“ In that case , ” said he , “ I should lose her , and by my own fault . ” He dwelt on this idea for a moment , then it appeared reality .
He even thought he could perceive something on the ground at a distance ; he ventured to call , and it seemed to him that the wind <unk> back an almost <unk> sigh .
At last the <unk> struck .
It was impossible to wait longer , his <unk> <unk> violently , his eyes were growing dim ; he passed one leg over the wall , and in a moment leaped down on the other side .
He was on Villefort ’ s <unk> — had arrived there by <unk> the wall .
What might be the <unk> ?
However , he had not ventured thus far to draw back .
He followed a short distance close under the wall , then crossed a path , hid entered a <unk> of trees .
In a moment he had passed through them , and could see the house distinctly .
<unk> Then Morrel saw that he had been right in believing that the house was not illuminated .
<unk> of lights at every window , as is <unk> on days of ceremony , he saw only a gray mass , which was veiled also by a cloud , which at that moment <unk> the moon ’ s feeble light .
A light moved rapidly from time to time past three windows of the second floor .
These three windows were in Madame de Saint-Méran ’ s room .
Another remained motionless behind some red curtains which were in Madame de Villefort ’ s bedroom .
Morrel guessed all this .
So many times , in order to follow Valentine in thought at every hour in the day , had he made her describe the whole house , that without having seen it he knew it all .
This darkness and silence alarmed Morrel still more than Valentine ’ s absence had done .
<unk> mad with grief , and determined to venture everything in order to see Valentine once more , and be certain of the misfortune he feared , Morrel gained the edge of the <unk> of trees , and was going to pass as quickly as possible through the <unk> , when the sound of a voice , still at some distance , but which was borne upon the wind , reached him .
At this sound , as he was already <unk> exposed to view , he stepped back and concealed himself completely , remaining perfectly motionless .
He had formed his resolution .
If it was Valentine alone , he would speak as she passed ; if she was accompanied , and he could not speak , still he should see her , and know that she was safe ; if they were strangers , he would listen to their conversation , and might understand something of this hitherto <unk> mystery .
The moon had just then escaped from behind the cloud which had concealed it , and Morrel saw Villefort come out upon the steps , followed by a gentleman in black .
They descended , and advanced towards the <unk> of trees , and Morrel soon recognized the other gentleman as <unk> d ’ Avrigny .
<unk> The young man , seeing them approach , drew back mechanically , until he found himself stopped by a <unk> in the centre of the <unk> ; there he was compelled to remain .
Soon the two gentlemen stopped also .
“ Ah , my dear doctor , ” said the procureur , “ Heaven <unk> itself against my house !
What a dreadful death — what a blow !
<unk> not to console me ; alas , nothing can <unk> so great a sorrow — the wound is too deep and too fresh !
<unk> , dead ! ” The cold <unk> sprang to the young man ’ s brow , and his teeth <unk> .
Who could be dead in that house , which Villefort himself had called <unk> ?
“ My dear M. de Villefort , ” replied the doctor , with a tone which redoubled the terror of the young man , “ I have not led you here to console you ; on the contrary — — ” “ What can you mean ? ” asked the procureur , alarmed .
“ I mean that behind the misfortune which has just happened to you , there is another , perhaps , still greater . ” “ Can it be possible ? ” murmured Villefort , <unk> his hands .
“ What are you going to tell me ? ” “ Are we quite alone , my friend ? ” “ Yes , quite ; but why all these precautions ? ” “ Because I have a terrible secret to communicate to you , ” said the doctor .
“ Let us sit down . ” Villefort fell , rather than seated himself .
The doctor stood before him , with one hand placed on his shoulder .
Morrel , <unk> , supported his head with one hand , and with the other pressed his heart , lest its <unk> should be heard .
“ <unk> , dead ! ” repeated he within himself ; and he felt as if he were also dying .
“ Speak , doctor — I am listening , ” said Villefort ; “ strike — I am prepared for everything ! ” “ Madame de Saint-Méran was , doubtless , advancing in years , but she enjoyed excellent health . ” Morrel began again to breathe freely , which he had not done during the last ten minutes .
“ <unk> has <unk> her , ” said Villefort — “ yes , grief , doctor !
After living forty years with the marquis — — ” “ It is not grief , my dear Villefort , ” said the doctor ; “ grief may kill , although it rarely does , and never in a day , never in an hour , never in ten minutes . ” Villefort answered nothing , he simply raised his head , which had been cast down before , and looked at the doctor with amazement .
“ Were you present during the last struggle ? ” asked M. d ’ Avrigny .
“ I was , ” replied the procureur ; “ you begged me not to leave . ” “ Did you notice the symptoms of the <unk> to which Madame de Saint-Méran has fallen a victim ? ” “ I did .
Madame de Saint-Méran had three <unk> <unk> , at intervals of some minutes , each one more serious than the former .
When you arrived , Madame de Saint-Méran had already been <unk> for breath some minutes ; she then had a fit , which I took to be simply a nervous attack , and it was only when I saw her raise herself in the bed , and her limbs and neck appear <unk> , that I became really alarmed .
Then I understood from your countenance there was more to fear than I had thought .
This crisis past , I endeavored to catch your eye , but could not .
You held her hand — you were feeling her pulse — and the second fit came on before you had turned towards me .
This was more terrible than the first ; the same nervous movements were repeated , and the mouth contracted and turned purple . ” “ And at the third she <unk> . ” “ At the end of the first attack I discovered symptoms of <unk> ; you confirmed my opinion . ” “ Yes , before others , ” replied the doctor ; “ but now we are alone — — ” “ What are you going to say ?
Oh , spare me ! ” “ That the symptoms of <unk> and <unk> by <unk> <unk> are the same . ” M. de Villefort started from his seat , then in a moment fell down again , silent and motionless .
Morrel knew not if he were dreaming or awake .
“ Listen , ” said the doctor ; “ I know the full importance of the statement I have just made , and the disposition of the man to whom I have made it . ” “ Do you speak to me as a magistrate or as a friend ? ” asked Villefort .
“ As a friend , and only as a friend , at this moment .
The <unk> in the symptoms of <unk> and <unk> by <unk> <unk> is so great , that were I obliged to <unk> by oath what I have now stated , I should hesitate ; I therefore repeat to you , I speak not to a magistrate , but to a friend .
And to that friend I say , ‘ During the <unk> of an hour that the struggle continued , I watched the <unk> and the death of Madame de Saint-Méran , and am thoroughly convinced that not only did her death proceed from poison , but I could also <unk> the poison . ’ ” “ Can it be possible ? ” “ The symptoms are marked , do you see ? — sleep broken by nervous <unk> , <unk> of the brain , <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
Madame de Saint-Méran <unk> to a powerful <unk> of <unk> or of <unk> , which by some mistake , perhaps , has been given to her . ” Villefort seized the doctor ’ s hand .
“ Oh , it is impossible , ” said he , “ I must be dreaming !
It is frightful to hear such things from such a man as you !
Tell me , I entreat you , my dear doctor , that you may be deceived . ” “ <unk> I may , but — — ” “ But ? ” <unk> “ But I do not think so . ” “ Have pity on me doctor !
So many dreadful things have happened to me lately that I am on the verge of madness . ” “ Has anyone besides me seen Madame de Saint-Méran ? ” “ No . ” “ Has anything been sent for from a <unk> ’ s that I have not examined ? ” “ Nothing . ” “ Had Madame de Saint-Méran any enemies ? ” “ Not to my knowledge . ” “ Would her death affect anyone ’ s interest ? ” “ It could not indeed , my daughter is her only <unk> — Valentine alone .
Oh , if such a thought could present itself , I would <unk> myself to <unk> my heart for having for one instant <unk> it . ” “ Indeed , my dear friend , ” said M. d ’ Avrigny , “ I would not <unk> anyone ; I speak only of an accident , you understand , — of a mistake , — but whether accident or mistake , the fact is there ; it is on my conscience and <unk> me to speak aloud to you .
Make inquiry . ” “ Of whom ? — how ? — of what ? ” “ May not Barrois , the old servant , have made a mistake , and have given Madame de Saint-Méran a <unk> prepared for his master ? ” “ For my father ? ” “ Yes . ” “ But how could a <unk> prepared for M. Noirtier poison Madame de Saint-Méran ? ” “ Nothing is more simple .
You know <unk> become <unk> in certain <unk> , of which <unk> is one .
For instance , having tried every other remedy to restore movement and speech to M. Noirtier , I resolved to try one last means , and for three months I have been giving him <unk> ; so that in the last <unk> I ordered for him there were six <unk> .
This quantity , which is perfectly safe to <unk> to the <unk> frame of M. Noirtier , which has become gradually accustomed to it , would be sufficient to kill another person . ” “ My dear doctor , there is no communication between M. Noirtier ’ s apartment and that of Madame de Saint-Méran , and Barrois never entered my <unk> ’ s room .
In short , doctor although I know you to be the most <unk> man in the world , and although I place the utmost <unk> in you , I want , notwithstanding my conviction , to believe this <unk> , _ <unk> <unk> est _ . ” “ Is there one of my <unk> in whom you have equal confidence with myself ? ” “ Why do you ask me that ? — what do you wish ? ” “ <unk> for him ; I will tell him what I have seen , and we will consult together , and examine the body . ” “ And you will find traces of poison ? ” “ No , I did not say of poison , but we can prove what was the state of the body ; we shall discover the cause of her sudden death , and we shall say , ‘ Dear Villefort , if this thing has been caused by <unk> , watch over your servants ; if from hatred , watch your enemies . ’ ” “ What do you propose to me , d ’ Avrigny ? ” said Villefort in despair ; “ so soon as another is admitted into our secret , an <unk> will become necessary ; and an <unk> in my house — impossible !
Still , ” continued the procureur , looking at the doctor with uneasiness , “ if you wish it — if you demand it , why then it shall be done .
But , doctor , you see me already so grieved — how can I introduce into my house so much <unk> , after so much sorrow ?
My wife and my daughter would die of it !
And I , doctor — you know a man does not arrive at the post I occupy — one has not been king ’ s attorney twenty-five years without having <unk> a tolerable number of enemies ; mine are numerous .
Let this affair be talked of , it will be a triumph for them , which will make them rejoice , and cover me with shame .
Pardon me , doctor , these <unk> ideas ; were you a priest I should not dare tell you that , but you are a man , and you know mankind .
<unk> , pray recall your words ; you have said nothing , have you ? ” “ My dear M. de Villefort , ” replied the doctor , “ my first duty is to humanity .
I would have saved Madame de Saint-Méran , if science could have done it ; but she is dead and my duty <unk> the living .
Let us <unk> this terrible secret in the <unk> <unk> of our hearts ; I am willing , if anyone should suspect this , that my silence on the subject should be <unk> to my ignorance .
Meanwhile , sir , watch always — watch carefully , for perhaps the evil may not stop here .
And when you have found the <unk> , if you find him , I will say to you , ‘ You are a magistrate , do as you will ! ’ ” “ I thank you , doctor , ” said Villefort with indescribable joy ; “ I never had a better friend than you . ” And , as if he feared <unk> d ’ Avrigny would recall his promise , he hurried him towards the house .
When they were gone , Morrel ventured out from under the trees , and the moon shone upon his face , which was so pale it might have been taken for that of a <unk> .
“ I am <unk> protected in a most wonderful , but most terrible manner , ” said he ; “ but Valentine , poor girl , how will she bear so much sorrow ? ” As he thought thus , he looked <unk> at the window with red curtains and the three windows with white curtains .
The light had almost disappeared from the former ; doubtless Madame de Villefort had just put out her lamp , and the <unk> alone reflected its dull light on the window .
At the extremity of the building , on the contrary , he saw one of the three windows open .
A <unk> placed on the <unk> threw some of its pale rays without , and a shadow was seen for one moment on the <unk> .
Morrel shuddered ; he thought he heard a sob .
It cannot be wondered at that his mind , generally so <unk> , but now disturbed by the two <unk> human passions , love and fear , was <unk> even to the indulgence of <unk> thoughts .
Although it was impossible that Valentine should see him , hidden as he was , he thought he heard the shadow at the window call him ; his disturbed mind told him so .
This double error became an irresistible reality , and by one of the <unk> <unk> of youth , he bounded from his <unk> , and with two <unk> , at the risk of being seen , at the risk of alarming Valentine , at the risk of being discovered by some exclamation which might escape the young girl , he crossed the <unk> , which by the light of the moon resembled a large white lake , and having passed the <unk> of <unk> which extended in front of the house , he reached the step , ran quickly up and pushed the door , which opened without offering any resistance .
Valentine had not seen him .
Her eyes , raised towards heaven , were watching a <unk> cloud <unk> over the azure , its form that of a shadow <unk> towards heaven .
Her <unk> and excited mind <unk> it as the soul of her grandmother .
Meanwhile , Morrel had traversed the <unk> and found the staircase , which , being <unk> , prevented his approach being heard , and he had regained that degree of confidence that the presence of M. de Villefort even would not have alarmed him .
He was quite prepared for any such encounter .
He would at once approach Valentine ’ s father and acknowledge all , <unk> Villefort to pardon and <unk> the love which united two fond and loving hearts .
Morrel was mad .
<unk> he did not meet anyone .
Now , especially , did he find the description Valentine had given of the interior of the house useful to him ; he arrived safely at the top of the staircase , and while he was feeling his way , a sob indicated the direction he was to take .
He turned back , a door partly open enabled him to see his road , and to hear the voice of one in sorrow .
He pushed the door open and entered .
At the other end of the room , under a white sheet which covered it , lay the corpse , still more alarming to Morrel since the account he had so <unk> <unk> .
By its side , on her knees , and with her head buried in the <unk> of an <unk> , was Valentine , trembling and <unk> , her hands extended above her head , clasped and stiff .
She had turned from the window , which remained open , and was praying in accents that would have affected the most <unk> ; her words were rapid , <unk> , <unk> , for the burning weight of grief almost stopped her utterance .
The moon shining through the open <unk> made the lamp appear to burn <unk> , and cast a <unk> hue over the whole scene .
Morrel could not resist this ; he was not <unk> for <unk> , he was not easily impressed , but Valentine suffering , weeping , <unk> her hands before him , was more than he could bear in silence .
He sighed , and whispered a name , and the head bathed in tears and pressed on the velvet <unk> of the chair — a head like that of a <unk> by <unk> — was raised and turned towards him .
Valentine perceived him without <unk> the least surprise .
A heart overwhelmed with one great grief is <unk> to <unk> emotions .
Morrel held out his hand to her .
Valentine , as her only <unk> for not having met him , pointed to the corpse under the sheet , and began to sob again .
Neither dared for some time to speak in that room .
They hesitated to break the silence which death seemed to <unk> ; at length Valentine ventured .
“ My friend , ” said she , “ how came you here ?
Alas , I would say you are welcome , had not death opened the way for you into this house . ” “ Valentine , ” said Morrel with a trembling voice , “ I had waited since half-past eight , and did not see you come ; I became uneasy , leaped the wall , found my way through the garden , when voices conversing about the fatal event — — ” “ What voices ? ” asked Valentine .
Morrel shuddered as he thought of the conversation of the doctor and M. de Villefort , and he thought he could see through the sheet the extended hands , the stiff neck , and the purple lips .
“ Your servants , ” said he , “ who were <unk> the whole of the sorrowful story ; from them I learned it all . ” “ But it was <unk> the failure of our plan to come up here , love . ” “ <unk> me , ” replied Morrel ; “ I will go away . ” “ No , ” said Valentine , “ you might meet someone ; stay . ” “ But if anyone should come here — — ” The young girl shook her head .
“ No one will come , ” said she ; “ do not fear , there is our <unk> , ” pointing to the bed .
“ But what has become of M. d ’ Épinay ? ” replied Morrel .
<unk> “ M.
Franz arrived to sign the contract just as my dear grandmother was dying . ” “ Alas , ” said Morrel with a feeling of selfish joy ; for he thought this death would cause the wedding to be <unk> <unk> .
“ But what <unk> my sorrow , ” continued the young girl , as if this feeling was to receive its immediate punishment , “ is that the poor old lady , on her <unk> , requested that the marriage might take place as soon as possible ; she also , thinking to protect me , was acting against me . ” “ <unk> ! ” said Morrel .
They both listened ; steps were distinctly heard in the corridor and on the stairs .
“ It is my father , who has just left his study . ” “ To accompany the doctor to the door , ” added Morrel .
“ How do you know it is the doctor ? ” asked Valentine , astonished .
“ I imagined it must be , ” said Morrel .
Valentine looked at the young man ; they heard the street door close , then M. de Villefort locked the garden door , and returned upstairs .
He stopped a moment in the <unk> , as if <unk> whether to turn to his own apartment or into Madame de Saint-Méran ’ s ; Morrel concealed himself behind a door ; Valentine remained motionless , grief seeming to <unk> her of all fear .
M. de Villefort passed on to his own room .
“ Now , ” said Valentine , “ you can neither go out by the front door nor by the garden . ” Morrel looked at her with astonishment .
“ There is but one way left you that is safe , ” said she ; “ it is through my grandfather ’ s room . ” She rose .
“ Come , ” she added .
“ Where ? ” asked Maximilian .
“ To my grandfather ’ s room . ” “ I in M. Noirtier ’ s apartment ? ” “ Yes . ” “ Can you mean it , Valentine ? ” “ I have long wished it ; he is my only remaining friend and we both need his help , — come . ” “ Be careful , Valentine , ” said Morrel , <unk> to comply with the young girl ’ s wishes ; “ I now see my error — I acted like a madman in coming in here .
Are you sure you are more reasonable ? ” “ Yes , ” said Valentine ; “ and I have but one scruple , — that of leaving my dear grandmother ’ s remains , which I had <unk> to watch . ” “ Valentine , ” said Morrel , “ death is in itself sacred . ” “ Yes , ” said Valentine ; “ besides , it will not be for long . ” She then crossed the corridor , and led the way down a narrow staircase to M. Noirtier ’ s room ; Morrel followed her on <unk> ; at the door they found the old servant .
“ Barrois , ” said Valentine , “ shut the door , and let no one come in . ” She passed first .
Noirtier , seated in his chair , and listening to every sound , was watching the door ; he saw Valentine , and his eye <unk> .
There was something grave and solemn in the approach of the young girl which struck the old man , and immediately his bright eye began to <unk> .
“ Dear grandfather . ” said she <unk> , “ you know poor <unk> died an hour since , and now I have no friend in the world but you . ” His expressive eyes <unk> the greatest tenderness .
“ To you alone , then , may I <unk> my sorrows and my hopes ? ” The <unk> motioned “ Yes . ” Valentine took Maximilian ’ s hand .
“ Look attentively , then , at this gentleman . ” The old man fixed his <unk> gaze with slight astonishment on Morrel .
“ It is M. Maximilian Morrel , ” said she ; “ the son of that good merchant of Marseilles , whom you doubtless recollect . ” “ Yes , ” said the old man .
“ He brings an <unk> name , which Maximilian is likely to render <unk> , since at thirty years of age he is a captain , an officer of the Legion of Honor . ” The old man signified that he recollected him .
“ Well , grandpapa , ” said Valentine , kneeling before him , and pointing to Maximilian , “ I love him , and will be only his ; were I compelled to marry another , I would destroy myself . ” The eyes of the <unk> expressed a multitude of <unk> thoughts .
“ You like M. Maximilian Morrel , do you not , grandpapa ? ” asked Valentine .
“ Yes . ” “ And you will protect us , who are your children , against the will of my father ? ” Noirtier cast an intelligent glance at Morrel , as if to say , “ perhaps I may . ” Maximilian understood him .
“ Mademoiselle , ” said he , “ you have a sacred duty to fulfil in your <unk> grandmother ’ s room , will you allow me the honor of a few minutes ’ conversation with M. Noirtier ? ” “ That is it , ” said the old man ’ s eye .
Then he looked anxiously at Valentine .
“ Do you fear he will not understand ? ” “ Yes . ” “ Oh , we have so often spoken of you , that he knows exactly how I talk to you . ” Then turning to Maximilian , with an <unk> smile ; although <unk> by sorrow , — “ He knows everything I know , ” said she .
Valentine arose , placed a chair for Morrel , requested Barrois not to admit anyone , and having tenderly embraced her grandfather , and <unk> taken leave of Morrel , she went away .
To prove to Noirtier that he was in Valentine ’ s confidence and knew all their secrets , Morrel took the <unk> , a pen , and some paper , and placed them all on a table where there was a light .
“ But first , ” said Morrel , “ allow me , sir , to tell you who I am , how much I love Mademoiselle Valentine , and what are my <unk> respecting her . ” Noirtier made a sign that he would listen .
It was an <unk> sight to witness this old man , apparently a mere useless burden , becoming the sole protector , support , and <unk> of the lovers who were both young , beautiful , and strong .
His remarkably noble and <unk> expression struck Morrel , who began his story with trembling .
He related the manner in which he had become acquainted with Valentine , and how he had loved her , and that Valentine , in her solitude and her misfortune , had accepted the offer of his devotion .
He told him his birth , his position , his fortune , and more than once , when he consulted the look of the <unk> , that look answered , “ That is good , proceed . ” “ And now , ” said Morrel , when he had finished the first part of his <unk> , “ now I have told you of my love and my hopes , may I inform you of my intentions ? ” “ Yes , ” signified the old man .
“ This was our resolution ; a cabriolet was in waiting at the gate , in which I intended to carry off Valentine to my sister ’ s house , to marry her , and to wait <unk> M. de Villefort ’ s pardon . ” “ No , ” said Noirtier .
“ We must not do so ? ” “ No . ” “ You do not <unk> our project ? ” “ No . ” “ There is another way , ” said Morrel .
The old man ’ s <unk> eye said , “ Which ? ” “ I will go , ” continued Maximilian , “ I will seek M. Franz d ’ Épinay — I am happy to be able to mention this in Mademoiselle de Villefort ’ s absence — and will conduct myself toward him so as to <unk> him to <unk> me . ” Noirtier ’ s look continued to <unk> .
“ You wish to know what I will do ? ” “ Yes . ” “ I will find him , as I told you .
I will tell him the <unk> which <unk> me to Mademoiselle Valentine ; if he be a sensible man , he will prove it by <unk> of his own accord the hand of his betrothed , and will secure my friendship , and love until death ; if he refuse , either through interest or ridiculous pride , after I have proved to him that he would be <unk> my wife from me , that Valentine loves me , and will have no other , I will fight with him , give him every advantage , and I shall kill him , or he will kill me ; if I am <unk> , he will not marry Valentine , and if I die , I am very sure Valentine will not marry him . ” Noirtier watched , with indescribable pleasure , this noble and sincere countenance , on which every sentiment his tongue uttered was <unk> , <unk> by the expression of his fine features all that <unk> <unk> to a sound and faithful drawing .
Still , when Morrel had finished , he shut his eyes several times , which was his manner of saying “ No . ” “ No ? ” said Morrel ; “ you <unk> of this second project , as you did of the first ? ” “ I do , ” signified the old man .
“ But what then must be done ? ” asked Morrel .
“ Madame de Saint-Méran ’ s last request was , that the marriage might not be delayed ; must I let things take their course ? ” Noirtier did not move .
“ I understand , ” said Morrel ; “ I am to wait . ” “ Yes . ” “ But delay may ruin our plan , sir , ” replied the young man .
“ <unk> , Valentine has no power ; she will be compelled to submit .
I am here almost <unk> , and can scarcely hope for so good an opportunity to occur again .
Believe me , there are only the two plans I have proposed to you ; forgive my vanity , and tell me which you prefer .
Do you <unk> Mademoiselle Valentine to <unk> herself to my honor ? ” “ No . ” “ Do you prefer I should seek M. d ’ Épinay ? ” “ No . ” “ <unk> then will come the help we need — from chance ? ” resumed Morrel .
“ No . ” “ From you ? ” “ Yes . ” “ You thoroughly understand me , sir ?
Pardon my eagerness , for my life depends on your answer .
Will our help come from you ? ” “ Yes . ” “ You are sure of it ? ” “ Yes . ” There was so much <unk> in the look which gave this answer , no one could , at any rate , doubt his will , if they did his power .
“ Oh , thank you a thousand times !
But how , unless a miracle should restore your speech , your gesture , your movement , how can you , <unk> to that armchair , <unk> and motionless , oppose this marriage ? ” A smile lit up the old man ’ s face , a strange smile of the eyes in a <unk> face .
“ Then I must wait ? ” asked the young man .
“ Yes . ” “ But the contract ? ” The same smile returned .
“ Will you assure me it shall not be signed ? ” “ Yes , ” said Noirtier .
“ The contract shall not be signed ! ” cried Morrel .
“ Oh , pardon me , sir ; I can scarcely realize so great a happiness .
Will they not sign it ? ” “ No , ” said the <unk> .
<unk> that assurance , Morrel still hesitated .
This promise of an <unk> old man was so strange that , instead of being the result of the power of his will , it might <unk> from <unk> <unk> .
Is it not natural that the madman , ignorant of his folly , should attempt things beyond his power ?
The weak man <unk> of <unk> he can raise , the timid of <unk> he can <unk> , the poor of treasures he <unk> , the most humble peasant , in the height of his pride , calls himself <unk> .
Whether Noirtier understood the young man ’ s <unk> , or whether he had not full confidence in his <unk> , he looked <unk> at him .
“ What do you wish , sir ? ” asked Morrel ; “ that I should <unk> my promise of remaining tranquil ? ” Noirtier ’ s eye remained fixed and firm , as if to <unk> that a promise did not suffice ; then it passed from his face to his hands .
“ Shall I swear to you , sir ? ” asked Maximilian .
“ Yes , ” said the <unk> with the same solemnity .
Morrel understood that the old man attached great importance to an oath .
He extended his hand .
“ I swear to you , on my honor , ” said he , “ to await your decision respecting the course I am to pursue with M. d ’ Épinay . ” “ That is right , ” said the old man .
“ Now , ” said Morrel , “ do you wish me to retire ? ” “ Yes . ” “ Without seeing Mademoiselle Valentine ? ” “ Yes . ” Morrel made a sign that he was ready to obey .
“ But , ” said he , “ first allow me to embrace you as your daughter did just now . ” Noirtier ’ s expression could not be understood .
The young man pressed his lips on the same spot , on the old man ’ s forehead , where Valentine ’ s had been .
Then he bowed a second time and retired .
He found outside the door the old servant , to whom Valentine had given directions .
Morrel was conducted along a dark passage , which led to a little door opening on the garden , soon found the spot where he had entered , with the assistance of the <unk> gained the top of the wall , and by his ladder was in an instant in the <unk> where his cabriolet was still waiting for him .
He got in it , and thoroughly <unk> by so many emotions , arrived about midnight in the Rue <unk> , threw himself on his bed and slept <unk> .
VOLUME <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> Chapter <unk> .
The Villefort <unk> <unk> Two days after , a considerable crowd was assembled , towards ten o ’ clock in the morning , around the door of M. de Villefort ’ s house , and a long file of <unk> and private carriages extended along the Faubourg <unk> and the Rue de la <unk> .
Among them was one of a very singular form , which appeared to have come from a distance .
It was a kind of covered <unk> , painted black , and was one of the first to arrive .
<unk> was made , and it was <unk> that , by a strange <unk> , this carriage contained the corpse of the Marquis de Saint-Méran , and that those who had come thinking to attend one funeral would follow two .
Their number was great .
The Marquis de Saint-Méran , one of the most <unk> and faithful <unk> of Louis XVIII .
and King Charles <unk> , had preserved a great number of friends , and these , added to the <unk> whom the <unk> of society gave Villefort a claim on , formed a considerable body .
<unk> information was given to the authorities , and permission obtained that the two <unk> should take place at the same time .
A second hearse , <unk> with the same <unk> <unk> , was brought to M. de Villefort ’ s door , and the coffin removed into it from the <unk> .
The two bodies were to be <unk> in the cemetery of <unk> , where M. de Villefort had long since had a tomb prepared for the reception of his family .
The remains of poor Renée were already deposited there , and now , after ten years of separation , her father and mother were to be <unk> with her .
The <unk> , always curious , always affected by <unk> display , looked on with religious silence while the splendid procession accompanied to their last abode two of the number of the old <unk> — the greatest <unk> of <unk> and sincere <unk> to their principles .
In one of the <unk> Beauchamp , Debray , and Château-Renaud were talking of the very sudden death of the <unk> .
“ I saw Madame de Saint-Méran only last year at Marseilles , when I was coming back from <unk> , ” said Château-Renaud ; “ she looked like a woman destined to live to be a hundred years old , from her apparent sound health and great activity of mind and body .
How old was she ? ” “ Franz assured me , ” replied Albert , “ that she was <unk> years old .
But she has not died of old age , but of grief ; it appears that since the death of the marquis , which affected her very deeply , she has not completely recovered her reason . ” “ But of what <unk> , then , did she die ? ” asked Debray .
“ It is said to have been a <unk> of the brain , or <unk> , which is the same thing , is it not ? ” “ Nearly . ” “ It is difficult to believe that it was <unk> , ” said Beauchamp .
“ Madame de Saint-Méran , whom I once saw , was short , of <unk> form , and of a much more nervous than <unk> <unk> ; grief could hardly produce <unk> in such a <unk> as that of Madame de Saint-Méran . ” “ At any rate , ” said Albert , “ whatever <unk> or doctor may have killed her , M. de Villefort , or rather , Mademoiselle Valentine , — or , still rather , our friend Franz , <unk> a magnificent fortune , <unk> , I believe , to <unk> livres per <unk> . ” “ And this fortune will be <unk> at the death of the old <unk> , Noirtier . ” “ That is a <unk> old grandfather , ” said Beauchamp .
“ _ <unk> <unk> <unk> _ .
I think he must have made an agreement with death to <unk> all his <unk> , and he appears likely to succeed .
He resembles the old <unk> of ’ 93 , who said to Napoleon , in <unk> , ‘ You bend because your <unk> is a young <unk> , <unk> by rapid growth .
Take the Republic for a <unk> ; let us return with renewed strength to the <unk> , and I promise you <unk> soldiers , another <unk> , and a second Austerlitz .
<unk> do not become <unk> , sire ; they slumber sometimes , but only <unk> the stronger before they sleep entirely . ’ ” “ <unk> and men appeared the same to him , ” said Albert .
“ One thing only <unk> me , <unk> , how Franz d ’ Épinay will like a grandfather who cannot be separated from his wife .
But where is Franz ? ” “ In the first carriage , with M. de Villefort , who <unk> him already as one of the family . ” <unk> Such was the conversation in almost all the carriages ; these two sudden <unk> , so quickly following each other , astonished everyone , but no one suspected the terrible secret which M. d ’ Avrigny had communicated , in his nocturnal walk to M. de Villefort .
They arrived in about an hour at the cemetery ; the weather was <unk> , but dull , and in <unk> with the funeral ceremony .
Among the groups which <unk> towards the family vault , Château-Renaud recognized Morrel , who had come alone in a cabriolet , and walked silently along the path bordered with <unk> .
“ You here ? ” said Château-Renaud , passing his arms through the young captain ’ s ; “ are you a friend of Villefort ’ s ?
How is it that I have never met you at his house ? ” “ I am no acquaintance of M. de Villefort ’ s , ” answered Morrel , “ but I was of Madame de Saint-Méran . ” Albert came up to them at this moment with Franz .
“ The time and place are but <unk> for an introduction . ” said Albert ; “ but we are not <unk> .
M. Morrel , allow me to present to you M. Franz d ’ Épinay , a delightful travelling companion , with whom I made the tour of Italy .
My dear Franz , M. Maximilian Morrel , an excellent friend I have acquired in your absence , and whose name you will hear me mention every time I make any allusion to affection , wit , or <unk> . ” Morrel hesitated for a moment ; he feared it would be <unk> to <unk> in a friendly manner the man whom he was <unk> <unk> , but his oath and the gravity of the circumstances recurred to his memory ; he struggled to conceal his emotion and bowed to Franz .
“ Mademoiselle de Villefort is in deep sorrow , is she not ? ” said Debray to Franz .
“ <unk> , ” replied he ; “ she looked so pale this morning , I scarcely knew her . ” These apparently simple words pierced Morrel to the heart .
This man had seen Valentine , and spoken to her !
The young and <unk> officer required all his strength of mind to resist breaking his oath .
He took the arm of Château-Renaud , and turned towards the vault , where the attendants had already placed the two <unk> .
“ This is a magnificent <unk> , ” said Beauchamp , looking towards the <unk> ; “ a summer and winter palace .
You will , in turn , enter it , my dear d ’ Épinay , for you will soon be <unk> as one of the family .
I , as a philosopher , should like a little <unk> , a cottage down there under the trees , without so many <unk> over my poor body .
In dying , I will say to those around me what Voltaire wrote to <unk> : ‘ _ <unk> <unk> _ , and all will be over . ’ But come , Franz , take courage , your wife is an <unk> . ” “ Indeed , Beauchamp , you are <unk> .
<unk> has made you laugh at everything , and political men have made you <unk> everything .
But when you have the honor of <unk> with ordinary men , and the pleasure of leaving politics for a moment , try to find your affectionate heart , which you leave with your stick when you go to the Chamber . ” “ But tell me , ” said Beauchamp , “ what is life ?
Is it not a halt in Death ’ s <unk> ? ” <unk> “ I am <unk> against Beauchamp , ” said Albert , drawing Franz away , and leaving the former to finish his <unk> <unk> with Debray .
The Villefort vault formed a square of white stones , about twenty feet high ; an interior <unk> separated the two families , and each apartment had its entrance door .
Here were not , as in other <unk> , <unk> <unk> , one above another , where <unk> <unk> its dead and <unk> them like <unk> in a <unk> ; all that was visible within the <unk> gates was a <unk> room , separated by a wall from the vault itself .
The two doors before mentioned were in the middle of this wall , and <unk> the Villefort and Saint-Méran <unk> .
There grief might freely <unk> itself without being disturbed by the trifling <unk> who came from a <unk> party to visit <unk> , or by lovers who make it their <unk> .
The two <unk> were placed on <unk> previously prepared for their reception in the <unk> <unk> belonging to the Saint-Méran family .
Villefort , Franz , and a few near <unk> alone entered the <unk> .
As the religious <unk> had all been performed at the door , and there was no address given , the party all separated ; Château-Renaud , Albert , and Morrel , went one way , and Debray and Beauchamp the other .
Franz remained with M. de Villefort ; at the gate of the cemetery Morrel made an excuse to wait ; he saw Franz and M. de Villefort get into the same <unk> , and thought this meeting <unk> evil .
He then returned to Paris , and although in the same carriage with Château-Renaud and Albert , he did not hear one word of their conversation .
As Franz was about to take leave of M. de Villefort , “ When shall I see you again ? ” said the latter .
“ At what time you please , sir , ” replied Franz .
“ As soon as possible . ” “ I am at your command , sir ; shall we return together ? ” “ If not unpleasant to you . ” “ On the contrary , I shall feel much pleasure . ” Thus , the future father and <unk> stepped into the same carriage , and Morrel , seeing them pass , became uneasy .
Villefort and Franz returned to the Faubourg <unk> .
The procureur , without going to see either his wife or his daughter , went at once to his study , and , offering the young man a chair : “ M.
d ’ Épinay , ” said he , “ allow me to remind you at this moment , — which is perhaps not so <unk> as at first sight may appear , for obedience to the wishes of the departed is the first offering which should be made at their tomb , — allow me then to remind you of the wish expressed by Madame de Saint-Méran on her <unk> , that Valentine ’ s wedding might not be <unk> .
You know the affairs of the <unk> are in perfect order , and her will <unk> to Valentine the entire property of the Saint-Méran family ; the notary showed me the documents yesterday , which will <unk> us to draw up the contract immediately .
You may call on the notary , M. <unk> , Place <unk> , Faubourg <unk> , and you have my authority to <unk> those deeds . ” “ Sir , ” replied M. d ’ Épinay , “ it is not , perhaps , the moment for Mademoiselle Valentine , who is in deep distress , to think of a husband ; indeed , I fear — — ” <unk> “ Valentine will have no greater pleasure than that of <unk> her grandmother ’ s last <unk> ; there will be no obstacle from that quarter , I assure you . ” “ In that case , ” replied Franz , “ as I shall raise none , you may make arrangements when you please ; I have <unk> my word , and shall feel pleasure and happiness in <unk> to it . ” “ Then , ” said Villefort , “ nothing further is required .
The contract was to have been signed three days since ; we shall find it all ready , and can sign it today . ” “ But the mourning ? ” said Franz , <unk> .
“ Don ’ t be uneasy on that <unk> , ” replied Villefort ; “ no ceremony will be neglected in my house .
Mademoiselle de Villefort may retire during the <unk> three months to her estate of Saint-Méran ; I say hers , for she <unk> it today .
There , after a few days , if you like , the civil marriage shall be celebrated without <unk> or ceremony .
Madame de Saint-Méran wished her daughter should be married there .
When that is over , you , sir , can return to Paris , while your wife passes the time of her mourning with her <unk> . ” “ As you please , sir , ” said Franz .
“ Then , ” replied M. de Villefort , “ have the kindness to wait half an hour ; Valentine shall come down into the drawing-room .
I will send for M. <unk> ; we will read and sign the contract before we separate , and this evening Madame de Villefort shall accompany Valentine to her estate , where we will <unk> them in a week . ” “ Sir , ” said Franz , “ I have one request to make . ” “ What is it ? ” “ I wish Albert de Morcerf and <unk> de Château-Renaud to be present at this signature ; you know they are my witnesses . ” “ Half an hour will suffice to <unk> them ; will you go for them yourself , or shall you send ? ” “ I prefer going , sir . ” “ I shall expect you , then , in half an hour , baron , and Valentine will be ready . ” Franz bowed and left the room .
<unk> had the door closed , when M. de Villefort sent to tell Valentine to be ready in the drawing-room in half an hour , as he expected the notary and M. d ’ Épinay and his witnesses .
The news caused a great sensation throughout the house ; Madame de Villefort would not believe it , and Valentine was <unk> .
She looked around for help , and would have gone down to her grandfather ’ s room , but on the stairs she met M. de Villefort , who took her arm and led her into the drawing-room .
In the <unk> , Valentine met Barrois , and looked <unk> at the old servant .
A moment later , Madame de Villefort entered the drawing-room with her little Edward .
It was evident that she had shared the grief of the family , for she was pale and looked fatigued .
She sat down , took Edward on her knees , and from time to time pressed this child , on whom her affections appeared <unk> , almost convulsively to her bosom .
Two carriages were soon heard to enter the courtyard .
One was the notary ’ s ; the other , that of Franz and his friends .
In a moment the whole party was assembled .
Valentine was so pale one might trace the blue veins from her <unk> , round her eyes and down her cheeks .
Franz was deeply affected .
Château-Renaud and Albert looked at each other with amazement ; the ceremony which was just concluded had not appeared more sorrowful than did that which was about to begin .
Madame de Villefort had placed herself in the shadow behind a velvet curtain , and as she constantly bent over her child , it was difficult to read the expression of her face .
M. de Villefort was , as usual , <unk> .
The notary , after having , according to the <unk> method , arranged the papers on the table , taken his place in an armchair , and raised his spectacles , turned towards Franz : “ Are you M. Franz de <unk> , baron d ’ Épinay ? ” asked he , although he knew it perfectly .
“ Yes , sir , ” replied Franz .
The notary bowed .
“ I have , then , to inform you , sir , at the request of M. de Villefort , that your projected marriage with Mademoiselle de Villefort has changed the feeling of M. Noirtier towards his <unk> , and that he <unk> her entirely of the fortune he would have left her .
Let me hasten to add , ” continued he , “ that the <unk> , having only the right to <unk> a part of his fortune , and having <unk> it all , the will will not bear <unk> , and is declared <unk> and void . ” “ Yes . ” said Villefort ; “ but I warn M. d ’ Épinay , that during my <unk> my father ’ s will shall never be questioned , my position <unk> any doubt to be entertained . ” <unk> “ Sir , ” said Franz , “ I regret much that such a question has been raised in the presence of Mademoiselle Valentine ; I have never inquired the amount of her fortune , which , however limited it may be , <unk> mine .
My family has sought consideration in this alliance with M. de Villefort ; all I seek is happiness . ” Valentine <unk> thanked him , while two silent tears rolled down her cheeks .
“ Besides , sir , ” said Villefort , addressing himself to his future <unk> , “ excepting the loss of a portion of your hopes , this unexpected will need not <unk> wound you ; M. Noirtier ’ s weakness of mind sufficiently <unk> it .
It is not because Mademoiselle Valentine is going to marry you that he is angry , but because she will marry , a union with any other would have caused him the same sorrow .
Old age is selfish , sir , and Mademoiselle de Villefort has been a faithful companion to M. Noirtier , which she cannot be when she becomes the <unk> d ’ Épinay .
My father ’ s melancholy state <unk> our speaking to him on any subjects , which the weakness of his mind would <unk> him from understanding , and I am perfectly convinced that at the present time , although , he knows that his <unk> is going to be married , M. Noirtier has even forgotten the name of his intended <unk> . ” M. de Villefort had scarcely said this , when the door opened , and Barrois appeared .
“ Gentlemen , ” said he , in a tone strangely firm for a servant speaking to his masters under such solemn circumstances , — “ gentlemen , M. Noirtier de Villefort wishes to speak immediately to M. Franz de <unk> , baron d ’ Épinay . ” He , as well as the notary , that there might be no mistake in the person , gave all his <unk> to the <unk> <unk> .
Villefort started , Madame de Villefort let her son slip from her knees , Valentine rose , pale and <unk> as a statue .
Albert and Château-Renaud exchanged a second look , more full of amazement than the first .
The notary looked at Villefort .
“ It is impossible , ” said the procureur .
“ M.
d ’ Épinay cannot leave the drawing-room at present . ” “ It is at this moment , ” replied Barrois with the same <unk> , “ that M. Noirtier , my master , wishes to speak on important subjects to M. Franz d ’ Épinay . ” “ <unk> Noirtier can speak now , then , ” said Edward , with his <unk> <unk> .
However , his remark did not make Madame de Villefort even smile , so much was every mind engaged , and so solemn was the situation .
“ Tell M. <unk> , ” resumed Villefort , “ that what he demands is impossible . ” “ Then , M. <unk> gives notice to these gentlemen , ” replied Barrois , “ that he will give orders to be carried to the drawing-room . ” <unk> was at its height .
Something like a smile was <unk> on Madame de Villefort ’ s countenance .
Valentine instinctively raised her eyes , as if to thank heaven .
“ Pray go , Valentine , ” said ; M. de Villefort , “ and see what this new fancy of your grandfather ’ s is . ” Valentine rose quickly , and was <unk> <unk> towards the door , when M. de Villefort altered his intention .
“ Stop , ” said he ; “ I will go with you . ” “ Excuse me , sir , ” said Franz , “ since M. Noirtier sent for me , I am ready to attend to his wish ; besides , I shall be happy to pay my respects to him , not having yet had the honor of doing so . ” “ Pray , sir , ” said Villefort with marked uneasiness , “ do not disturb yourself . ” <unk> “ <unk> me , sir , ” said Franz in a resolute tone .
“ I would not lose this opportunity of <unk> to M. Noirtier how wrong it would be of him to <unk> feelings of dislike to me , which I am determined to <unk> , whatever they may be , by my devotion . ” And without listening to Villefort he arose , and followed Valentine , who was running downstairs with the joy of a <unk> <unk> who finds a rock to <unk> to .
M. de Villefort followed them .
Château-Renaud and Morcerf exchanged a third look of still increasing wonder .
Chapter <unk> .
A <unk> <unk> Noirtier was prepared to receive them , dressed in black , and <unk> in his armchair .
When the three persons he expected had entered , he looked at the door , which his valet immediately closed .
“ Listen , ” whispered Villefort to Valentine , who could not conceal her joy ; “ if M. Noirtier wishes to communicate anything which would delay your marriage , I <unk> you to understand him . ” Valentine <unk> , but did not answer .
Villefort , approached Noirtier .
“ Here is M. Franz d ’ Épinay , ” said he ; “ you requested to see him .
We have all wished for this interview , and I trust it will convince you how <unk> are your objections to Valentine ’ s marriage . ” Noirtier answered only by a look which made Villefort ’ s blood run cold .
He motioned to Valentine to approach .
In a moment , thanks to her habit of conversing with her grandfather , she understood that he asked for a key .
Then his eye was fixed on the drawer of a small chest between the windows .
She opened the drawer , and found a key ; and , understanding that was what he wanted , again watched his eyes , which turned toward an old <unk> which had been neglected for many years and was supposed to contain nothing but useless documents .
“ Shall I open the <unk> ? ” asked Valentine .
“ Yes , ” said the old man .
“ And the <unk> ? ” “ Yes . ” “ Those at the side ? ” “ No . ” “ The middle one ? ” “ Yes . ” Valentine opened it and drew out a bundle of papers .
“ Is that what you wish for ? ” asked she .
“ No . ” She took <unk> all the other papers out till the drawer was empty .
“ But there are no more , ” said she .
Noirtier ’ s eye was fixed on the <unk> .
“ Yes , I understand , grandfather , ” said the young girl .
<unk> She pointed to each letter of the <unk> .
At the letter S the old man stopped her .
She opened , and found the word “ secret . ” “ Ah !
is there a secret spring ? ” said Valentine .
“ Yes , ” said Noirtier .
“ And who knows it ? ” Noirtier looked at the door where the servant had gone out .
“ Barrois ? ” said she .
“ Yes . ” “ Shall I call him ? ” “ Yes . ” Valentine went to the door , and called Barrois .
Villefort ’ s impatience during this scene made the perspiration roll from his forehead , and Franz was stupefied .
The old servant came .
“ Barrois , ” said Valentine , “ my grandfather has told me to open that drawer in the <unk> , but there is a secret spring in it , which you know — will you open it ? ” Barrois looked at the old man .
“ <unk> , ” said Noirtier ’ s intelligent eye .
Barrois touched a spring , the false bottom came out , and they saw a bundle of papers tied with a black <unk> .
“ Is that what you wish for ? ” said Barrois .
“ Yes . ” “ Shall I give these papers to M. de Villefort ? ” “ No . ” “ To Mademoiselle Valentine ? ” “ No . ” “ To M. Franz d ’ Épinay ? ” “ Yes . ” Franz , astonished , advanced a step .
“ To me , sir ? ” said he .
“ Yes . ” Franz took them from Barrois and casting a glance at the cover , read : “ ‘ To be given , after my death , to General <unk> , who shall <unk> the packet to his son , with an <unk> to preserve it as containing an important <unk> . ’ “ Well , sir , ” asked Franz , “ what do you wish me to do with this paper ? ” “ To preserve it , sealed up as it is , doubtless , ” said the procureur .
“ No , ” replied Noirtier eagerly .
“ Do you wish him to read it ? ” said Valentine .
“ Yes , ” replied the old man .
“ You understand , baron , my grandfather wishes you to read this paper , ” said Valentine .
“ Then let us sit down , ” said Villefort impatiently , “ for it will take some time . ” “ <unk> down , ” said the old man .
Villefort took a chair , but Valentine remained standing by her father ’ s side , and Franz before him , holding the mysterious paper in his hand .
“ <unk> , ” said the old man .
Franz <unk> it , and in the midst of the most profound silence read : <unk> “ ‘ _ <unk> of the report of a meeting of the Bonapartist <unk> in the Rue Saint-Jacques , held February 5th , 1815 _ . ’ ” Franz stopped .
“ February 5th , 1815 ! ” said he ; “ it is the day my father was murdered . ” Valentine and Villefort were <unk> ; the eye of the old man alone seemed to say clearly , “ Go on . ” “ But it was on leaving this club , ” said he , “ my father disappeared . ” Noirtier ’ s eye continued to say , “ <unk> . ” He resumed : — “ ‘ The <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> of artillery , <unk> <unk> , general of <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , <unk> of woods and <unk> , declare , that on the <unk> of February , a letter arrived from the Island of Elba , <unk> to the kindness and the confidence of the Bonapartist <unk> , General <unk> de <unk> , who having served the emperor from <unk> to <unk> was supposed to be devoted to the interests of the Napoleon <unk> , notwithstanding the title of baron which Louis XVIII .
had just granted to him with his estate of Épinay .
<unk> “ ‘ A note was in consequence addressed to General de <unk> , <unk> him to be present at the meeting next day , the 5th .
The note indicated neither the street nor the number of the house where the meeting was to be held ; it bore no signature , but it announced to the general that someone would call for him if he would be ready at nine o ’ clock .
The <unk> were always held from that time till midnight .
At nine o ’ clock the president of the club presented himself ; the general was ready , the president informed him that one of the conditions of his introduction was that he should be <unk> ignorant of the place of meeting , and that he would allow his eyes to be <unk> , <unk> that he would not endeavor to take off the <unk> .
General de <unk> accepted the condition , and promised on his honor not to seek to discover the road they took .
The general ’ s carriage was ready , but the president told him it was impossible for him to use it , since it was useless to <unk> the master if the coachman knew through what streets he went .
“ What must be done then ? ” asked the general . — “ I have my carriage here , ” said the president .
“ ‘ “ Have you , then , so much confidence in your servant that you can <unk> him with a secret you will not allow me to know ? ” “ ‘ “ Our coachman is a member of the club , ” said the president ; “ we shall be driven by a <unk> . ” “ ‘ “ Then we run another risk , ” said the general , laughing , “ that of being upset . ” We <unk> this joke to prove that the general was not in the least compelled to attend the meeting , but that he came willingly .
When they were seated in the carriage the president reminded the general of his promise to allow his eyes to be <unk> , to which he made no opposition .
On the road the president thought he saw the general make an attempt to remove the handkerchief , and reminded him of his oath .
“ <unk> enough , ” said the general .
The carriage stopped at an alley leading out of the Rue Saint-Jacques .
The general <unk> , leaning on the arm of the president , of whose dignity he was not aware , considering him simply as a member of the club ; they went through the alley , mounted a flight of stairs , and entered the <unk> .
“ ‘ The <unk> had already begun .
The members , <unk> of the sort of <unk> which was to be made that evening , were all in <unk> .
When in the middle of the room the general was invited to remove his <unk> , he did so immediately , and was surprised to see so many <unk> faces in a society of whose existence he had till then been ignorant .
They questioned him as to his sentiments , but he contented himself with answering , that the letters from the Island of Elba ought to have informed them — — ’ ” Franz interrupted himself by saying , “ My father was a <unk> ; they need not have asked his sentiments , which were well known . ” “ And hence , ” said Villefort , “ arose my affection for your father , my dear M. Franz .
<unk> held in common are a ready <unk> of union . ” “ <unk> again , ” said the old man .
Franz continued : “ ‘ The president then sought to make him speak more <unk> , but M. de <unk> replied that he wished first to know what they wanted with him .
He was then informed of the contents of the letter from the Island of Elba , in which he was recommended to the club as a man who would be likely to advance the interests of their party .
One paragraph spoke of the return of Bonaparte and promised another letter and further details , on the arrival of the _ Pharaon _ belonging to the <unk> Morrel , of Marseilles , whose captain was entirely devoted to the emperor .
During all this time , the general , on whom they thought to have <unk> as on a brother , manifested evidently signs of <unk> and <unk> .
When the reading was finished , he remained silent , with <unk> <unk> .
“ ‘ “ Well , ” asked the president , “ what do you say to this letter , general ? ” “ ‘ “ I say that it is too soon after <unk> myself for Louis XVIII .
to break my <unk> in <unk> of the <unk> . ” This answer was too clear to permit of any mistake as to his sentiments .
“ General , ” said the president , “ we acknowledge no King Louis XVIII . , or an <unk> , but his majesty the emperor and king , driven from France , which is his <unk> , by violence and <unk> . ” “ ‘ “ Excuse me , gentlemen , ” said the general ; “ you may not acknowledge Louis XVIII . , but I do , as he has made me a baron and a <unk> , and I shall never forget that for these two <unk> I am indebted to his happy return to France . ” “ ‘ “ Sir , ” said the president , rising with gravity , “ be careful what you say ; your words clearly show us that they are deceived concerning you in the Island of Elba , and have deceived us !
The communication has been made to you in consequence of the confidence placed in you , and which does you honor .
Now we discover our error ; a title and <unk> attach you to the government we wish to <unk> .
We will not <unk> you to help us ; we <unk> no one against his conscience , but we will <unk> you to act <unk> , even if you are not disposed to do so . ” “ ‘ “ You would call acting <unk> , knowing your <unk> and not <unk> against you , that is what I should call becoming your <unk> .
You see I am more <unk> than you . ” ’ ” “ Ah , my father ! ” said Franz , <unk> himself .
“ I understand now why they murdered him . ” Valentine could not help casting one glance towards the young man , whose <unk> enthusiasm it was delightful to behold .
Villefort walked to and fro behind them .
Noirtier watched the expression of each one , and preserved his <unk> and <unk> attitude .
Franz returned to the <unk> , and continued : “ ‘ “ Sir , ” said the president , “ you have been invited to join this assembly — you were not forced here ; it was proposed to you to come <unk> — you accepted .
When you <unk> with this <unk> request you well knew we did not wish to secure the throne of Louis XVIII . , or we should not take so much care to avoid the <unk> of the police .
It would be <unk> too much to allow you to put on a mask to aid you in the discovery of our secret , and then to remove it that you may ruin those who have <unk> in you .
No , no , you must first say if you declare yourself for the king of a day who now <unk> , or for his majesty the emperor . ” “ ‘ “ I am a <unk> , ” replied the general ; “ I have taken the oath of <unk> to Louis XVIII . , and I will <unk> to it . ” These words were followed by a general murmur , and it was evident that several of the members were <unk> the <unk> of making the general <unk> of his <unk> .
“ ‘ The president again arose , and having imposed silence , said , — “ Sir , you are too serious and too sensible a man not to understand the <unk> of our present situation , and your <unk> has already <unk> to us the conditions which remain for us to offer you . ” The general , putting his hand on his sword , exclaimed , — “ If you talk of honor , do not begin by <unk> its laws , and <unk> nothing by violence . ” “ ‘ “ And you , sir , ” continued the president , with a calmness still more terrible than the general ’ s anger , “ I advise you not to touch your sword . ” The general looked around him with slight uneasiness ; however he did not yield , but calling up all his <unk> , said , — “ I will not swear . ” “ ‘ “ Then you must die , ” replied the president calmly .
M. d ’ Épinay became very pale ; he looked round him a second time , several members of the club were whispering , and getting their arms from under their <unk> .
“ General , ” said the president , “ do not alarm yourself ; you are among men of honor who will use every means to convince you before <unk> to the last extremity , but as you have said , you are among <unk> , you are in possession of our secret , and you must restore it to us . ” A significant silence followed these words , and as the general did not reply , — “ <unk> the doors , ” said the president to the <unk> .
<unk> “ ‘ The same deadly silence succeeded these words .
Then the general advanced , and making a violent effort to <unk> his feelings , — “ I have a son , ” said he , “ and I ought to think of him , finding myself among <unk> . ” “ ‘ “ General , ” said the chief of the assembly , “ one man may insult fifty — it is the privilege of weakness .
But he does wrong to use his privilege .
<unk> my advice , swear , and do not insult . ” The general , again <unk> by the superiority of the chief , hesitated a moment ; then advancing to the president ’ s desk , — “ What is the form , said he .
“ ‘ “ It is this : — ‘ I swear by my honor not to reveal to anyone what I have seen and heard on the 5th of February , 1815 , between nine and ten o ’ clock in the evening ; and I <unk> guilty of death should I ever <unk> this oath . ’ ” The general appeared to be affected by a nervous <unk> , which prevented his answering for some moments ; then , <unk> his <unk> <unk> , he pronounced the required oath , but in so low a tone as to be scarcely audible to the <unk> of the members , who insisted on his <unk> it clearly and distinctly , which he did .
“ ‘ “ Now am I at liberty to retire ? ” said the general .
The president rose , appointed three members to accompany him , and got into the carriage with the general after <unk> his eyes .
One of those three members was the coachman who had driven them there .
The other members silently <unk> .
“ Where do you wish to be taken ? ” asked the president . — “ <unk> out of your presence , ” replied M. d ’ Épinay .
“ <unk> , sir , ” replied the president , “ you are no longer in the assembly , and have only to do with <unk> ; do not insult them unless you wish to be held <unk> . ” But instead of listening , M. d ’ Épinay went on , — “ You are still as brave in your carriage as in your assembly because you are still four against one . ” The president stopped the coach .
They were at that part of the <unk> des <unk> where the steps lead down to the river .
“ Why do you stop here ? ” asked d ’ Épinay .
“ ‘ “ Because , sir , ” said the president , “ you have <unk> a man , and that man will not go one step farther without <unk> honorable <unk> . ” “ ‘ “ Another method of <unk> ? ” said the general , <unk> his shoulders .
“ ‘ “ Make no noise , sir , unless you wish me to consider you as one of the men of whom you spoke just now as <unk> , who take their weakness for a <unk> .
You are alone , one alone shall answer you ; you have a sword by your side , I have one in my cane ; you have no witness , one of these gentlemen will serve you .
Now , if you please , remove your <unk> . ” The general tore the handkerchief from his eyes .
“ At last , ” said he , “ I shall know with whom I have to do . ” They opened the door and the four men <unk> . ’ ” Franz again interrupted himself , and wiped the cold drops from his brow ; there was something awful in hearing the son read aloud in trembling pallor these details of his father ’ s death , which had hitherto been a mystery .
Valentine clasped her hands as if in prayer .
Noirtier looked at Villefort with an almost sublime expression of contempt and pride .
Franz continued : “ ‘ It was , as we said , the fifth of February .
For three days the <unk> had been five or six degrees below <unk> and the steps were covered with ice .
The general was <unk> and tall , the president offered him the side of the <unk> to assist him in getting down .
The two witnesses followed .
It was a dark night .
The ground from the steps to the river was covered with snow and <unk> , the water of the river looked black and deep .
One of the seconds went for a lantern in a <unk> near , and by its light they examined the weapons .
The president ’ s sword , which was simply , as he had said , one he carried in his cane , was five inches <unk> than the general ’ s , and had no guard .
The general proposed to cast <unk> for the swords , but the president said it was he who had given the <unk> , and when he had given it he had supposed each would use his own arms .
The witnesses endeavored to insist , but the president bade them be silent .
The lantern was placed on the ground , the two <unk> took their <unk> , and the duel began .
The light made the two swords appear like <unk> of lightning ; as for the men , they were scarcely <unk> , the darkness was so great .
<unk> “ ‘ General d ’ Épinay passed for one of the best <unk> in the army , but he was pressed so closely in the <unk> that he missed his aim and fell .
The witnesses thought he was dead , but his <unk> , who knew he had not struck him , offered him the assistance of his hand to rise .
The circumstance irritated instead of <unk> the general , and he rushed on his <unk> .
But his <unk> did not allow his guard to be broken .
He received him on his sword and three times the general drew back on finding himself too closely engaged , and then returned to the charge .
At the third he fell again .
They thought he slipped , as at first , and the witnesses , seeing he did not move , approached and endeavored to raise him , but the one who passed his arm around the body found it was <unk> with blood .
The general , who had almost fainted , <unk> .
“ Ah , ” said he , “ they have sent some <unk> to fight with me . ” The president , without answering , approached the witness who held the lantern , and raising his <unk> , showed him two wounds he had received in his arm ; then opening his coat , and <unk> his waistcoat , displayed his side , pierced with a third wound .
Still he had not even uttered a sigh .
General d ’ Épinay died five minutes after . ’ ” Franz read these last words in a voice so <unk> that they were hardly audible , and then stopped , passing his hand over his eyes as if to <unk> a cloud ; but after a moment ’ s silence , he continued : “ ‘ The president went up the steps , after <unk> his sword into his cane ; a track of blood on the snow marked his course .
He had scarcely arrived at the top when he heard a heavy <unk> in the water — it was the general ’ s body , which the witnesses had just thrown into the river after <unk> that he was dead .
The general fell , then , in a <unk> duel , and not in <unk> as it might have been reported .
In proof of this we have signed this paper to <unk> the truth of the facts , lest the moment should arrive when either of the <unk> in this terrible scene should be accused of <unk> murder or of <unk> of the laws of honor .
“ ‘ <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . ’ ” When Franz had finished reading this account , so dreadful for a son ; when Valentine , pale with emotion , had wiped away a tear ; when Villefort , trembling , and <unk> in a corner , had endeavored to <unk> the storm by <unk> glances at the <unk> old man , — “ Sir , ” said d ’ Épinay to Noirtier , “ since you are well acquainted with all these details , which are <unk> by honorable <unk> , — since you appear to take some interest in me , although you have only manifested it hitherto by <unk> me sorrow , refuse me not one final satisfaction — tell me the name of the president of the club , that I may at least know who killed my father . ” Villefort mechanically felt for the handle of the door ; Valentine , who understood sooner than anyone her grandfather ’ s answer , and who had often seen two <unk> upon his right arm , drew back a few steps .
“ Mademoiselle , ” said Franz , turning towards Valentine , “ <unk> your efforts with mine to find out the name of the man who made me an <unk> at two years of age . ” Valentine remained <unk> and motionless .
“ Hold , sir , ” said Villefort , “ do not <unk> this dreadful scene .
The names have been <unk> concealed ; my father himself does not know who this president was , and if he knows , he cannot tell you ; proper names are not in the <unk> . ” “ Oh , misery , ” cried Franz : “ the only hope which sustained me and enabled me to read to the end was that of knowing , at least , the name of him who killed my father !
Sir , sir , ” cried he , turning to Noirtier , “ do what you can — make me understand in some way ! ” “ Yes , ” replied Noirtier .
“ Oh , mademoiselle , mademoiselle ! ” cried Franz , “ your grandfather says he can indicate the person .
<unk> me , — lend me your assistance ! ” Noirtier looked at the <unk> .
Franz took it with a nervous trembling , and repeated the letters of the <unk> <unk> , until he came to M. At that letter the old man signified “ Yes . ” “ <unk> , ” repeated Franz .
The young man ’ s finger , <unk> over the words , but at each one Noirtier answered by a <unk> sign .
Valentine hid her head between her hands .
At length , Franz arrived at the word <unk> .
<unk> “ Yes ! ” “ You ! ” cried Franz , whose hair stood on end ; “ you , M. Noirtier — you killed my father ? ” “ Yes ! ” replied Noirtier , fixing a <unk> look on the young man .
Franz fell <unk> on a chair ; Villefort opened the door and escaped , for the idea had entered his mind to <unk> the little remaining life in the heart of this terrible old man .
Chapter <unk> .
<unk> of Cavalcanti the <unk> Meanwhile M. Cavalcanti the elder had returned to his service , not in the army of his majesty the Emperor of <unk> , but at the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> , of which he was one of the most <unk> <unk> .
He had spent every <unk> that had been allowed for his journey as a <unk> for the <unk> and solemn manner in which he had <unk> his assumed character of father .
M. Andrea at his departure <unk> all the papers which proved that he had indeed the honor of being the son of the Marquis <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
He was now fairly <unk> in that Parisian society which gives such ready access to <unk> , and <unk> them , not as they really are , but as they wish to be considered .
Besides , what is required of a young man in Paris ?
To speak its language tolerably , to make a good appearance , to be a good <unk> , and to pay in <unk> .
They are certainly less particular with a <unk> than with a Frenchman .
Andrea had , then , in a fortnight , attained a very fair position .
He was called count , he was said to possess <unk> livres per <unk> ; and his father ’ s immense riches , buried in the <unk> of <unk> , were a constant <unk> .
A learned man , before whom the last circumstance was mentioned as a fact , declared he had seen the <unk> in question , which gave great weight to <unk> hitherto somewhat doubtful , but which now assumed the <unk> of reality .
Such was the state of society in Paris at the period we bring before our <unk> , when Monte Cristo went one evening to pay M. Danglars a visit .
M. Danglars was out , but the count was asked to go and see the baroness , and he accepted the invitation .
It was never without a nervous shudder , since the dinner at Auteuil , and the events which followed it , that Madame Danglars heard Monte Cristo ’ s name announced .
If he did not come , the painful sensation became most intense ; if , on the contrary , he appeared , his noble countenance , his brilliant eyes , his <unk> , his <unk> attention even towards Madame Danglars , soon <unk> every impression of fear .
It appeared impossible to the baroness that a man of such <unk> pleasing manners should entertain evil <unk> against her ; besides , the most <unk> minds only suspect evil when it would answer some interested end — useless <unk> is <unk> to every mind .
<unk> When Monte Cristo entered the <unk> , to which we have already once introduced our <unk> , and where the baroness was examining some <unk> , which her daughter passed to her after having looked at them with M. Cavalcanti , his presence soon produced its usual effect , and it was with smiles that the baroness received the count , although she had been a little <unk> at the <unk> of his name .
The latter took in the whole scene at a glance .
The baroness was <unk> <unk> on a sofa , Eugénie sat near her , and Cavalcanti was standing .
Cavalcanti , dressed in black , like one of <unk> ’ s heroes , with <unk> shoes and white silk <unk> stockings , passed a white and tolerably <unk> hand through his light hair , and so displayed a sparkling diamond , that in spite of Monte Cristo ’ s advice the vain young man had been unable to resist putting on his little finger .
This movement was accompanied by <unk> glances at Mademoiselle Danglars , and by <unk> <unk> in the same direction .
Mademoiselle Danglars was still the same — cold , beautiful , and <unk> .
Not one of these glances , nor one sigh , was lost on her ; they might have been said to fall on the <unk> of <unk> , which some philosophers <unk> protected sometimes the breast of <unk> .
Eugénie bowed coldly to the count , and <unk> herself of the first moment when the conversation became earnest to escape to her study , whence very soon two cheerful and <unk> voices being heard in connection with <unk> notes of the <unk> assured Monte Cristo that Mademoiselle Danglars preferred to his society and to that of M. Cavalcanti the company of Mademoiselle Louise d ’ <unk> , her singing <unk> .
It was then , especially while conversing with Madame Danglars , and apparently absorbed by the charm of the conversation , that the count noticed M. Andrea Cavalcanti ’ s solicitude , his manner of listening to the music at the door he dared not pass , and of <unk> his admiration .
The banker soon returned .
His first look was certainly directed towards Monte Cristo , but the second was for Andrea .
As for his wife , he bowed to her , as some <unk> do to their <unk> , but in a way that <unk> will never comprehend , until a very <unk> <unk> is <unk> on <unk> life .
“ Have not the ladies invited you to join them at the <unk> ? ” said Danglars to Andrea .
“ Alas , no , sir , ” replied Andrea with a sigh , still more remarkable than the former ones .
Danglars immediately advanced towards the door and opened it .
<unk> The two young ladies were seen seated on the same chair , at the <unk> , <unk> themselves , each with one hand , a fancy to which they had accustomed themselves , and performed admirably .
Mademoiselle d ’ <unk> , whom they then perceived through the open <unk> , formed with Eugénie one of the _ <unk> <unk> _ of which the <unk> are so fond .
She was somewhat beautiful , and <unk> formed — a little <unk> figure , with large <unk> falling on her neck , which was rather too long , as <unk> sometimes makes his <unk> , and her eyes dull from fatigue .
She was said to have a weak chest , and like <unk> in the _ <unk> <unk> _ , she would die one day while singing .
Monte Cristo cast one rapid and curious glance round this <unk> ; it was the first time he had ever seen Mademoiselle d ’ <unk> , of whom he had heard much .
“ Well , ” said the banker to his daughter , “ are we then all to be <unk> ? ” He then led the young man into the study , and either by chance or <unk> the door was <unk> closed after Andrea , so that from the place where they sat neither the Count nor the baroness could see anything ; but as the banker had accompanied Andrea , Madame Danglars appeared to take no notice of it .
The count soon heard Andrea ’ s voice , singing a Corsican song , accompanied by the <unk> .
While the count smiled at hearing this song , which made him lose sight of Andrea in the recollection of Benedetto , Madame Danglars was <unk> to Monte Cristo of her husband ’ s strength of mind , who that very morning had lost three or four hundred thousand francs by a failure at <unk> .
The praise was well deserved , for had not the count heard it from the baroness , or by one of those means by which he knew everything , the baron ’ s countenance would not have led him to suspect it .
“ <unk> , ” thought Monte Cristo , “ he begins to conceal his <unk> ; a month since he <unk> of them . ” Then aloud , — “ Oh , madame , M. Danglars is so skilful , he will soon <unk> at the <unk> what he <unk> elsewhere . ” “ I see that you <unk> in a <unk> error , ” said Madame Danglars .
“ What is it ? ” said Monte Cristo .
“ That M. Danglars <unk> , <unk> he never does . ” “ <unk> , madame , I recollect M. Debray told me — — <unk> , what has become of him ?
I have seen nothing of him the last three or four days . ” “ Nor I , ” said Madame Danglars ; “ but you began a sentence , sir , and did not finish . ” “ Which ? ” “ M.
Debray had told you — — ” “ Ah , yes ; he told me it was you who <unk> to the <unk> of <unk> . ” “ I was once very fond of it , but I do not indulge now . ” “ Then you are wrong , madame .
<unk> is <unk> ; and if I were a woman and fate had made me a banker ’ s wife , whatever might be my confidence in my husband ’ s good fortune , still in <unk> you know there is great risk .
Well , I would secure for myself a fortune independent of him , even if I acquired it by placing my interests in hands unknown to him . ” Madame Danglars <unk> , in spite of all her efforts .
“ Stay , ” said Monte Cristo , as though he had not observed her confusion , “ I have heard of a lucky <unk> that was made yesterday on the <unk> bonds . ” “ I have none — nor have I ever possessed any ; but really we have talked long enough of money , count , we are like two <unk> ; have you heard how fate is <unk> the poor <unk> ? ” “ What has happened ? ” said the count , <unk> total ignorance .
“ You know the Marquis of Saint-Méran died a few days after he had set out on his journey to Paris , and the <unk> a few days after her arrival ? ” “ Yes , ” said Monte Cristo , “ I have heard that ; but , as <unk> said to <unk> , ‘ it is a law of nature ; their fathers died before them , and they <unk> their loss ; they will die before their children , who will , in their turn , <unk> for them . ’ ” “ But that is not all . ” “ Not all ! ” “ No ; they were going to marry their daughter — — ” “ To M. Franz d ’ Épinay .
Is it broken off ? ” “ <unk> morning , it appears , Franz declined the honor . ” “ Indeed ?
And is the reason known ? ” “ No . ” “ How extraordinary !
And how does M. de Villefort bear it ? ” “ As usual .
Like a philosopher . ” Danglars returned at this moment alone .
“ Well , ” said the baroness , “ do you leave M. Cavalcanti with your daughter ? ” “ And Mademoiselle d ’ <unk> , ” said the banker ; “ do you consider her no one ? ” Then , turning to Monte Cristo , he said , “ Prince Cavalcanti is a charming young man , is he not ?
But is he really a prince ? ” “ I will not answer for it , ” said Monte Cristo .
“ His father was introduced to me as a marquis , so he ought to be a count ; but I do not think he has much claim to that title . ” “ Why ? ” said the banker .
“ If he is a prince , he is wrong not to <unk> his rank ; I do not like anyone to deny his origin . ” “ Oh , you are a thorough <unk> , ” said Monte Cristo , smiling .
“ But do you see to what you are <unk> yourself ? ” said the baroness .
“ If , <unk> , M. de Morcerf came , he would find M. Cavalcanti in that room , where he , the betrothed of Eugénie , has never been admitted . ” “ You may well say , <unk> , ” replied the banker ; “ for he comes so seldom , it would seem only chance that brings him . ” “ But should he come and find that young man with your daughter , he might be displeased . ” “ He ?
You are mistaken .
M. Albert would not do us the honor to be jealous ; he does not like Eugénie sufficiently .
Besides , I care not for his <unk> . ” “ Still , situated as we are — — ” “ Yes , do you know how we are situated ?
At his mother ’ s ball he danced once with Eugénie , and M. Cavalcanti three times , and he took no notice of it . ” The valet announced the <unk> Albert de Morcerf .
The baroness rose hastily , and was going into the study , when Danglars stopped her .
“ Let her alone , ” said he .
She looked at him in amazement .
Monte Cristo appeared to be unconscious of what passed .
Albert entered , looking very handsome and in high spirits .
He bowed <unk> to the baroness , <unk> to Danglars , and <unk> to Monte Cristo .
Then turning to the baroness : “ May I ask how Mademoiselle Danglars is ? ” said he .
“ She is quite well , ” replied Danglars quickly ; “ she is at the <unk> with M. Cavalcanti . ” Albert retained his calm and indifferent manner ; he might feel perhaps <unk> , but he knew Monte Cristo ’ s eye was on him .
“ M.
Cavalcanti has a fine <unk> voice , ” said he , “ and Mademoiselle Eugénie a splendid <unk> , and then she plays the <unk> like <unk> .
The <unk> must be a delightful one . ” “ They suit each other remarkably well , ” said Danglars .
Albert appeared not to notice this remark , which was , however , so rude that Madame Danglars <unk> .
“ I , too , ” said the young man , “ am a <unk> — at least , my masters used to tell me so ; but it is strange that my voice never would suit any other , and a <unk> less than any . ” Danglars smiled , and seemed to say , “ It is of no consequence . ” Then , hoping doubtless to effect his purpose , he said , — “ The prince and my daughter were <unk> admired yesterday .
You were not of the party , M. de Morcerf ? ” “ What prince ? ” asked Albert .
“ Prince Cavalcanti , ” said Danglars , who <unk> in giving the young man that title .
“ Pardon me , ” said Albert , “ I was not aware that he was a prince .
And Prince Cavalcanti sang with Mademoiselle Eugénie yesterday ?
It must have been charming , indeed .
I regret not having heard them .
But I was unable to accept your invitation , having promised to accompany my mother to a German <unk> given by the <unk> of Château-Renaud . ” This was followed by rather an awkward silence .
“ May I also be allowed , ” said Morcerf , “ to pay my respects to Mademoiselle Danglars ? ” “ Wait a moment , ” said the banker , stopping the young man ; “ do you hear that delightful <unk> ?
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ; it is charming , let them finish — one moment .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> ! ” The banker was enthusiastic in his <unk> .
<unk> “ Indeed , ” said Albert , “ it is exquisite ; it is impossible to understand the music of his country better than Prince Cavalcanti does .
You said prince , did you not ?
But he can easily become one , if he is not already ; it is no <unk> thing in Italy .
But to return to the charming <unk> — you should give us a treat , Danglars , without telling them there is a stranger .
<unk> them to sing one more song ; it is so delightful to hear music in the distance , when the <unk> are <unk> by observation . ” Danglars was quite <unk> by the young man ’ s indifference .
He took Monte Cristo aside .
“ What do you think of our lover ? ” said he .
“ He appears cool .
But , then your word is given . ” “ Yes , doubtless I have promised to give my daughter to a man who loves her , but not to one who does not .
See him there , cold as marble and proud like his father .
If he were rich , if he had Cavalcanti ’ s fortune , that might be <unk> .
_ Ma foi _ , I <unk> ’ t consulted my daughter ; but if she has good taste — — ” “ Oh , ” said Monte Cristo , “ my <unk> may blind me , but I assure you I consider Morcerf a charming young man who will render your daughter happy and will sooner or later <unk> a certain amount of distinction , and his father ’ s position is good . ” “ <unk> , ” said Danglars .
“ Why do you doubt ? ” “ The past — that obscurity on the past . ” “ But that does not affect the son . ” “ Very true . ” “ Now , I beg of you , don ’ t go off your head .
It ’ s a month now that you have been thinking of this marriage , and you must see that it <unk> some <unk> on me , for it was at my house you met this young Cavalcanti , whom I do not really know at all . ” “ But I do . ” “ Have you made inquiry ? ” “ Is there any need of that !
Does not his appearance speak for him ?
And he is very rich . ” “ I am not so sure of that . ” “ And yet you said he had money . ” “ <unk> thousand livres — a mere trifle . ” “ He is well <unk> . ” “ <unk> , ” said Monte Cristo in his turn .
“ He is a <unk> . ” “ So are all <unk> . ” “ Come , count , you do not do that young man justice . ” “ Well , I acknowledge it <unk> me , knowing your connection with the Morcerf family , to see him throw himself in the way . ” Danglars burst out laughing .
“ What a <unk> you are ! ” said he ; “ that happens every day . ” “ But you cannot break it off in this way ; the <unk> are <unk> on this union . ” “ Indeed . ” “ <unk> . ” “ Then let them explain themselves ; you should give the father a hint , you are so intimate with the family . ” “ I ? — where the devil did you find out that ? ” “ At their ball ; it was apparent enough .
Why , did not the countess , the proud Mercédès , the <unk> <unk> , who will scarcely open her lips to her <unk> <unk> , take your arm , lead you into the garden , into the private walks , and remain there for half an hour ? ” “ Ah , baron , baron , ” said Albert , “ you are not listening — what <unk> in a <unk> like you ! ” “ Oh , don ’ t <unk> about me , Sir <unk> , ” said Danglars ; then turning to Monte Cristo he said : “ But will you <unk> to speak to the father ? ” “ <unk> , if you wish it . ” “ But let it be done <unk> and positively .
If he demands my daughter let him fix the day — declare his conditions ; in short , let us either understand each other , or quarrel .
You understand — no more delay . ” “ Yes , sir , I will give my attention to the subject . ” “ I do not say that I await with pleasure his decision , but I do await it .
A banker must , you know , be a slave to his promise . ” And Danglars sighed as M. Cavalcanti had done half an hour before .
“ <unk> !
<unk> !
<unk> ! ” cried Morcerf , <unk> the banker , as the <unk> came to an end .
Danglars began to look <unk> at Morcerf , when someone came and whispered a few words to him .
“ I shall soon return , ” said the banker to Monte Cristo ; “ wait for me .
I shall , perhaps , have something to say to you . ” And he went out .
The baroness took advantage of her husband ’ s absence to <unk> open the door of her daughter ’ s study , and M. Andrea , who was sitting before the <unk> with Mademoiselle Eugénie , started up like a <unk> .
Albert bowed with a smile to Mademoiselle Danglars , who did not appear in the least disturbed , and returned his bow with her usual coolness .
Cavalcanti was evidently embarrassed ; he bowed to Morcerf , who replied with the most <unk> look possible .
Then Albert <unk> out in praise of Mademoiselle Danglars ’ voice , and on his regret , after what he had just heard , that he had been unable to be present the previous evening .
Cavalcanti , being left alone , turned to Monte Cristo .
“ Come , ” said Madame Danglars , “ leave music and compliments , and let us go and take tea . ” “ Come , Louise , ” said Mademoiselle Danglars to her friend .
They passed into the next drawing-room , where tea was prepared .
Just as they were beginning , in the English fashion , to leave the <unk> in their <unk> , the door again opened and Danglars entered , <unk> agitated .
Monte Cristo observed it particularly , and by a look asked the banker for an explanation .
“ I have just received my <unk> from Greece , ” said Danglars .
“ Ah , yes , ” said the count ; “ that was the reason of your running away from us . ” “ Yes . ” “ How is King <unk> getting on ? ” asked Albert in the most <unk> tone .
Danglars cast another suspicious look towards him without answering , and Monte Cristo turned away to conceal the expression of pity which passed over his features , but which was gone in a moment .
“ We shall go together , shall we not ? ” said Albert to the count .
“ If you like , ” replied the latter .
Albert could not understand the banker ’ s look , and turning to Monte Cristo , who understood it perfectly , — “ Did you see , ” said he , “ how he looked at me ? ” “ Yes , ” said the count ; “ but did you think there was anything particular in his look ? ” “ Indeed , I did ; and what does he mean by his news from Greece ? ” “ How can I tell you ? ” “ Because I imagine you have <unk> in that country . ” Monte Cristo smiled <unk> .
“ Stop , ” said Albert , “ here he comes .
I shall compliment Mademoiselle Danglars on her <unk> , while the father <unk> to you . ” “ If you compliment her at all , let it be on her voice , at least , ” said Monte Cristo .
“ No , everyone would do that . ” “ My dear viscount , you are dreadfully <unk> . ” Albert advanced towards Eugénie , smiling .
Meanwhile , Danglars , <unk> to Monte Cristo ’ s ear , “ Your advice was excellent , ” said he ; “ there is a whole history connected with the names Fernand and Yanina . ” “ Indeed ? ” said Monte Cristo .
“ Yes , I will tell you all ; but take away the young man ; I cannot endure his presence . ” “ He is going with me .
Shall I send the father to you ? ” “ <unk> . ” “ Very well . ” The count made a sign to Albert and they bowed to the ladies , and took their leave , Albert perfectly indifferent to Mademoiselle Danglars ’ contempt , Monte Cristo <unk> his advice to Madame Danglars on the prudence a banker ’ s wife should exercise in providing for the future .
M. Cavalcanti remained master of the field .
Chapter <unk> .
Haydée <unk> had the count ’ s horses cleared the angle of the boulevard , when Albert , turning towards the count , burst into a loud fit of laughter — much too loud in fact not to give the idea of its being rather forced and <unk> .
“ Well , ” said he , “ I will ask you the same question which Charles <unk> .
put to Catherine de ’ <unk> , after the <unk> of Saint <unk> : ‘ How have I played my little part ? ’ ” “ To what do you <unk> ? ” asked Monte Cristo .
“ To the <unk> of my <unk> at M. Danglars ’ . ” “ What <unk> ? ” “ _ Ma foi ! _ what <unk> ?
Why , your <unk> , M. Andrea Cavalcanti ! ” “ Ah , no <unk> , viscount , if you please ; I do not <unk> M. Andrea — at least , not as concerns M. Danglars . ” “ And you would be to blame for not <unk> him , if the young man really needed your help in that quarter , but , happily for me , he can <unk> with it . ” “ What , do you think he is paying his <unk> ? ” “ I am certain of it ; his <unk> looks and <unk> tones when addressing Mademoiselle Danglars fully <unk> his intentions .
He <unk> to the hand of the proud Eugénie . ” “ What does that signify , so long as they favor your suit ? ” “ But it is not the case , my dear count : on the contrary .
I am <unk> on all sides . ” “ What ! ” “ It is so indeed ; Mademoiselle Eugénie scarcely <unk> me , and Mademoiselle d ’ <unk> , her <unk> , does not speak to me at all . ” “ But the father has the greatest regard possible for you , ” said Monte Cristo .
“ He ?
Oh , no , he has plunged a thousand <unk> into my heart , <unk> , I own , which instead of <unk> <unk> their points in their own <unk> , but <unk> which he nevertheless believed to be real and deadly . ” “ <unk> <unk> affection . ” “ True ; but I am not jealous . ” “ He is . ” “ Of whom ? — of Debray ? ” “ No , of you . ” “ Of me ?
I will engage to say that before a week is past the door will be closed against me . ” “ You are mistaken , my dear viscount . ” “ <unk> it to me . ” “ Do you wish me to do so ? ” “ Yes . ” “ Well , I am charged with the commission of endeavoring to induce the Comte de Morcerf to make some <unk> arrangement with the baron . ” “ By whom are you charged ? ” “ By the baron himself . ” “ Oh , ” said Albert with all the <unk> of which he was capable .
“ You surely will not do that , my dear count ? ” “ Certainly I shall , Albert , as I have promised to do it . ” “ Well , ” said Albert , with a sigh , “ it seems you are determined to marry me . ” “ I am determined to try and be on good terms with everybody , at all events , ” said Monte Cristo .
“ But <unk> of Debray , how is it that I have not seen him lately at the baron ’ s house ? ” “ There has been a <unk> . ” “ What , with the baroness ? ” “ No , with the baron . ” “ Has he perceived anything ? ” “ Ah , that is a good joke ! ” “ Do you think he <unk> ? ” said Monte Cristo with charming <unk> .
“ Where have you come from , my dear count ? ” said Albert .
“ From <unk> , if you will . ” “ It must be farther off than even that . ” “ But what do I know of your Parisian <unk> ? ” “ Oh , my dear count , <unk> are pretty much the same everywhere ; an individual husband of any country is a pretty fair <unk> of the whole race . ” “ But then , what can have led to the quarrel between Danglars and Debray ?
They seemed to understand each other so well , ” said Monte Cristo with renewed energy .
“ Ah , now you are trying to penetrate into the mysteries of <unk> , in which I am not <unk> .
When M. Andrea Cavalcanti has become one of the family , you can ask him that question . ” The carriage stopped .
“ Here we are , ” said Monte Cristo ; “ it is only half-past ten o ’ clock , come in . ” “ Certainly , I will . ” “ My carriage shall take you back . ” “ No , thank you ; I gave orders for my _ <unk> _ to follow me . ” “ There it is , then , ” said Monte Cristo , as he stepped out of the carriage .
They both went into the house ; the drawing-room was lighted up — they went in there .
“ You will make tea for us , Baptistin , ” said the count .
Baptistin left the room without waiting to answer , and in two seconds reappeared , bringing on a <unk> , all that his master had ordered , ready prepared , and appearing to have sprung from the ground , like the <unk> which we read of in <unk> <unk> .
“ Really , my dear count , ” said Morcerf , “ what I admire in you is , not so much your riches , for perhaps there are people even <unk> than yourself , nor is it only your wit , for <unk> might have possessed as much , — but it is your manner of being served , without any questions , in a moment , in a second ; it is as if they guessed what you wanted by your manner of <unk> , and made a point of keeping everything you can possibly desire in constant readiness . ” “ What you say is perhaps true ; they know my habits .
For instance , you shall see ; how do you wish to occupy yourself during <unk> ? ” “ _ Ma foi _ , I should like to smoke . ” Monte Cristo took the <unk> and struck it once .
In about the space of a second a private door opened , and Ali appeared , bringing two <unk> filled with excellent <unk> .
“ It is quite wonderful , ” said Albert .
“ Oh no , it is as simple as possible , ” replied Monte Cristo .
“ Ali knows I generally smoke while I am taking my tea or coffee ; he has heard that I ordered tea , and he also knows that I brought you home with me ; when I summoned him he naturally guessed the reason of my doing so , and as he comes from a country where hospitality is especially manifested through the medium of smoking , he naturally <unk> that we shall smoke in company , and therefore brings two <unk> instead of one — and now the mystery is <unk> . ” “ Certainly you give a most <unk> air to your explanation , but it is not the less true that you — — Ah , but what do I hear ? ” and Morcerf inclined his head towards the door , through which sounds seemed to issue resembling those of a <unk> .
“ _ Ma foi _ , my dear viscount , you are <unk> to hear music this evening ; you have only escaped from Mademoiselle Danglars ’ <unk> , to be attacked by Haydée ’ s <unk> . ” “ Haydée — what an <unk> name !
Are there , then , really women who bear the name of Haydée anywhere but in <unk> ’ s <unk> ? ” “ Certainly there are .
Haydée is a very <unk> name in France , but is common enough in <unk> and <unk> ; it is as if you said , for example , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , — it is a kind of <unk> name , as you <unk> call it . ” “ Oh , that is charming , ” said Albert , “ how I should like to hear my <unk> called Mademoiselle <unk> , Mademoiselle Silence , Mademoiselle Christian <unk> !
Only think , then , if Mademoiselle Danglars , instead of being called <unk> , had been named Mademoiselle <unk> Danglars ; what a fine effect that would have produced on the <unk> of her marriage ! ” “ Hush , ” said the count , “ do not joke in so loud a tone ; Haydée may hear you , perhaps . ” “ And you think she would be angry ? ” “ No , certainly not , ” said the count with a haughty expression .
“ She is very amiable , then , is she not ? ” said Albert .
“ It is not to be called <unk> , it is her duty ; a slave does not <unk> to a master . ” “ Come ; you are <unk> yourself now .
Are there any more <unk> to be had who bear this beautiful name ? ” “ <unk> . ” “ Really , count , you do nothing , and have nothing like other people .
The slave of the Count of Monte Cristo !
Why , it is a rank of itself in France , and from the way in which you <unk> money , it is a place that must be worth a hundred thousand francs a year . ” “ A hundred thousand francs !
The poor girl <unk> possessed much more than that ; she was born to treasures in comparison with which those <unk> in the _ <unk> and One <unk> _ would seem but poverty . ” “ She must be a <unk> then . ” “ You are right ; and she is one of the greatest in her country too . ” “ I thought so .
But how did it happen that such a great <unk> became a slave ? ” “ How was it that <unk> the <unk> became a <unk> ?
The fortune of war , my dear viscount , — the <unk> of fortune ; that is the way in which these things are to be <unk> for . ” “ And is her name a secret ? ” “ As <unk> the <unk> of mankind it is ; but not for you , my dear viscount , who are one of my most intimate friends , and on whose silence I feel I may rely , if I consider it necessary to <unk> it — may I not do so ? ” “ Certainly ; on my word of honor . ” “ You know the history of the <unk> of Yanina , do you not ? ” “ Of Ali <unk> ? <unk> Oh , yes ; it was in his service that my father made his fortune . ” “ True , I had forgotten that . ” <unk> “ Well , what is Haydée to Ali <unk> ? ” “ <unk> his daughter . ” “ What ?
the daughter of Ali <unk> ? ” “ Of Ali <unk> and the beautiful <unk> . ” “ And your slave ? ” “ _ Ma foi _ , yes . ” “ But how did she become so ? ” “ Why , simply from the circumstance of my having bought her one day , as I was passing through the <unk> at <unk> . ” “ <unk> !
Really , my dear count , you seem to throw a sort of <unk> influence over all in which you are concerned ; when I listen to you , existence no longer seems reality , but a waking dream .
Now , I am perhaps going to make an imprudent and <unk> request , but — — ” “ Say on . ” “ But , since you go out with Haydée , and sometimes even take her to the Opera — — ” “ Well ? ” “ I think I may venture to ask you this favor . ” “ You may venture to ask me anything . ” “ Well then , my dear count , present me to your <unk> . ” “ I will do so ; but on two conditions . ” “ I accept them at once . ” “ The first is , that you will never tell anyone that I have granted the interview . ” “ Very well , ” said Albert , extending his hand ; “ I swear I will not . ” “ The second is , that you will not tell her that your father ever served hers . ” “ I give you my oath that I will not . ” “ <unk> , viscount ; you will remember those two <unk> , will you not ?
But I know you to be a man of honor . ” The count again struck the <unk> .
Ali reappeared .
“ Tell Haydée , ” said he , “ that I will take coffee with her , and give her to understand that I desire permission to present one of my friends to her . ” Ali bowed and left the room .
“ Now , understand me , ” said the count , “ no direct questions , my dear Morcerf ; if you wish to know anything , tell me , and I will ask her . ” “ <unk> . ” Ali reappeared for the third time , and drew back the <unk> hanging which concealed the door , to signify to his master and Albert that they were at liberty to pass on .
“ Let us go in , ” said Monte Cristo .
Albert passed his hand through his hair , and <unk> his <unk> , then , having satisfied himself as to his personal appearance , followed the count into the room , the latter having previously resumed his hat and gloves .
Ali was stationed as a kind of advanced guard , and the door was kept by the three French attendants , commanded by <unk> .
Haydée was awaiting her visitors in the first room of her apartments , which was the drawing-room .
Her large eyes were <unk> with surprise and expectation , for it was the first time that any man , except Monte Cristo , had been <unk> an entrance into her presence .
She was sitting on a sofa placed in an angle of the room , with her legs crossed under her in the <unk> fashion , and seemed to have made for herself , as it were , a kind of <unk> in the rich <unk> <unk> which enveloped her .
<unk> her was the instrument on which she had just been playing ; it was <unk> <unk> , and worthy of its mistress .
On perceiving Monte Cristo , she arose and welcomed him with a smile peculiar to herself , expressive at once of the most <unk> obedience and also of the <unk> love .
Monte Cristo advanced towards her and extended his hand , which she as usual raised to her lips .
<unk> Albert had proceeded no farther than the door , where he remained <unk> to the spot , being completely <unk> by the sight of such <unk> beauty , beheld as it was for the first time , and of which an <unk> of more <unk> <unk> could form no <unk> idea .
“ <unk> do you bring ? ” asked the young girl in <unk> , of Monte Cristo ; “ is it a friend , a brother , a simple acquaintance , or an enemy . ” “ A friend , ” said Monte Cristo in the same language .
“ What is his name ? ” “ Count Albert ; it is the same man whom I <unk> from the hands of the <unk> at Rome . ” “ In what language would you like me to <unk> with him ? ” Monte Cristo turned to Albert .
“ Do you know modern Greek , ” asked he .
“ Alas !
no , ” said Albert ; “ nor even ancient Greek , my dear count ; never had <unk> or <unk> a more unworthy <unk> than myself . ” “ Then , ” said Haydée , <unk> by her remark that she had quite understood Monte Cristo ’ s question and Albert ’ s answer , “ then I will speak either in French or Italian , if my lord so <unk> it . ” Monte Cristo reflected one instant .
“ You will speak in Italian , ” said he .
Then , turning towards Albert , — “ It is a pity you do not understand either ancient or modern Greek , both of which Haydée speaks so <unk> ; the poor child will be obliged to talk to you in Italian , which will give you but a very false idea of her powers of conversation . ” The count made a sign to Haydée to address his visitor .
“ Sir , ” she said to Morcerf , “ you are most welcome as the friend of my lord and master . ” This was said in excellent <unk> , and with that soft Roman accent which makes the language of <unk> as <unk> as that of <unk> .
Then , turning to Ali , she directed him to bring coffee and <unk> , and when he had left the room to <unk> the orders of his young mistress she <unk> Albert to approach nearer to her .
Monte Cristo and Morcerf drew their <unk> towards a small table , on which were arranged music , <unk> , and <unk> of flowers .
Ali then entered bringing coffee and <unk> ; as to M. Baptistin , this portion of the building was <unk> to him .
Albert refused the <unk> which the <unk> offered him .
“ Oh , take it — take it , ” said the count ; “ Haydée is almost as <unk> as a Parisian ; the smell of a <unk> is disagreeable to her , but the <unk> of the East is a most <unk> perfume , you know . ” Ali left the room .
The <unk> of coffee were all prepared , with the addition of <unk> , which had been brought for Albert .
Monte Cristo and Haydée took the <unk> in the original Arabian manner , that is to say , without <unk> .
Haydée took the <unk> cup in her little <unk> fingers and conveyed it to her mouth with all the innocent <unk> of a child when eating or drinking something which it likes .
At this moment two women entered , bringing <unk> filled with <unk> and <unk> , which they placed on two small tables <unk> to that purpose .
“ My dear host , and you , <unk> , ” said Albert , in Italian , “ excuse my apparent <unk> .
I am quite bewildered , and it is natural that it should be so .
Here I am in the heart of Paris ; but a moment ago I heard the <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , and now I feel as if I were suddenly <unk> to the East ; not such as I have seen it , but such as my dreams have painted it .
Oh , <unk> , if I could but speak Greek , your conversation , added to the <unk> which <unk> me , would furnish an evening of such delight as it would be impossible for me ever to forget . ” “ I speak sufficient Italian to <unk> me to <unk> with you , sir , ” said Haydée quietly ; “ and if you like what is <unk> , I will do my best to secure the <unk> of your <unk> while you are here . ” “ On what subject shall I <unk> with her ? ” said Albert , in a low tone to Monte Cristo .
“ Just what you please ; you may speak of her country and of her youthful <unk> , or if you like it better you can talk of Rome , Naples , or <unk> . ” “ Oh , ” said Albert , “ it is of no use to be in the company of a Greek if one <unk> just in the same style as with a Parisian ; let me speak to her of the East . ” “ Do so then , for of all <unk> which you could choose that will be the most agreeable to her taste . ” Albert turned towards Haydée .
“ At what age did you leave Greece , <unk> ? ” asked he .
“ I left it when I was but five years old , ” replied Haydée .
“ And have you any recollection of your country ? ” “ When I shut my eyes and think , I seem to see it all again .
The mind can see as well as the body .
The body <unk> sometimes ; but the mind always <unk> . ” “ And how far back into the past do your recollections <unk> ? ” “ I could scarcely walk when my mother , who was called <unk> , which means royal , ” said the young girl , <unk> her head <unk> , “ took me by the hand , and after putting in our purse all the money we possessed , we went out , both covered with <unk> , to <unk> <unk> for the prisoners , saying , ‘ He who <unk> to the poor <unk> to the Lord . ’ Then when our purse was full we returned to the palace , and without saying a word to my father , we sent it to the convent , where it was divided amongst the prisoners . ” “ And how old were you at that time ? ” “ I was three years old , ” said Haydée .
“ Then you remember everything that went on about you from the time when you were three years old ? ” said Albert .
“ Everything . ” “ Count , ” said Albert , in a low tone to Monte Cristo , “ do allow the <unk> to tell me something of her history .
You <unk> my <unk> my father ’ s name to her , but perhaps she will <unk> to him of her own accord in the course of the <unk> , and you have no idea how delighted I should be to hear our name pronounced by such beautiful lips . ” Monte Cristo turned to Haydée , and with an expression of countenance which commanded her to pay the most <unk> attention to his words , he said in Greek , “ <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , ” — that is , “ Tell us the fate of your father ; but neither the name of the <unk> nor the <unk> . ” Haydée sighed deeply , and a shade of sadness <unk> her beautiful brow .
“ What are you saying to her ? ” said Morcerf in an <unk> .
“ I again reminded her that you were a friend , and that she need not conceal anything from you . ” “ Then , ” said Albert , “ this <unk> <unk> in <unk> of the prisoners was your first remembrance ; what is the next ? ” “ Oh , then I remember as if it were but yesterday sitting under the shade of some <unk> , on the <unk> of a lake , in the waters of which the trembling <unk> was reflected as in a mirror .
Under the <unk> and <unk> of these trees , <unk> on <unk> , sat my father ; my mother was at his feet , and I , <unk> , amused myself by playing with his long white beard which descended to his <unk> , or with the <unk> of the <unk> attached to his <unk> .
Then from time to time there came to him an <unk> who said something to which I paid no attention , but which he always answered in the same tone of voice , either ‘ <unk> , ’ or ‘ Pardon . ’ ” “ It is very strange , ” said Albert , “ to hear such words proceed from the mouth of anyone but an <unk> on the stage , and one needs constantly to be saying to one ’ s self , ‘ This is no <unk> , it is all reality , ’ in order to believe it .
And how does France appear in your eyes , accustomed as they have been to gaze on such <unk> scenes ? ” “ I think it is a fine country , ” said Haydée , “ but I see France as it really is , because I look on it with the eyes of a woman ; <unk> my own country , which I can only judge of from the impression produced on my <unk> mind , always seems enveloped in a vague <unk> , which is luminous or otherwise , according as my <unk> of it are sad or joyous . ” “ So young , ” said Albert , forgetting at the moment the Count ’ s command that he should ask no questions of the slave herself , “ is it possible that you can have known what suffering is except by name ? ” Haydée turned her eyes towards Monte Cristo , who , making at the same time some imperceptible sign , murmured : “ <unk> — speak . ” “ Nothing is ever so firmly impressed on the mind as the memory of our early childhood , and with the exception of the two scenes I have just described to you , all my <unk> <unk> are <unk> with <unk> sadness . ” <unk> “ Speak , speak , <unk> , ” said Albert , “ I am listening with the most intense delight and interest to all you say . ” Haydée answered his remark with a melancholy smile .
“ You wish me , then , to relate the history of my past sorrows ? ” said she .
“ I beg you to do so , ” replied Albert .
“ Well , I was but four years old when one night I was suddenly awakened by my mother .
We were in the palace of Yanina ; she <unk> me from the <unk> on which I was sleeping , and on opening my eyes I saw hers filled with tears .
She took me away without speaking .
When I saw her weeping I began to cry too .
‘ Hush , child ! ’ said she .
At other times in spite of <unk> <unk> or <unk> , I had with a child ’ s <unk> been accustomed to indulge my feelings of sorrow or anger by crying as much as I felt inclined ; but on this occasion there was an <unk> of such extreme terror in my mother ’ s voice when she <unk> me to silence , that I ceased crying as soon as her command was given .
She bore me rapidly away .
“ I saw then that we were descending a large staircase ; around us were all my mother ’ s servants carrying <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , jewels , <unk> of gold , with which they were hurrying away in the greatest <unk> .
“ Behind the women came a guard of twenty men armed with long guns and pistols , and dressed in the costume which the <unk> have assumed since they have again become a nation .
You may imagine there was something startling and <unk> , ” said Haydée , shaking her head and turning pale at the mere remembrance of the scene , “ in this long file of <unk> and women only <unk> from sleep , or at least so they appeared to me , who was myself scarcely awake .
Here and there on the walls of the staircase , were reflected gigantic shadows , which trembled in the <unk> light of the <unk> till they seemed to reach to the <unk> roof above .
“ ‘ <unk> ! ’ said a voice at the end of the gallery .
This voice made everyone bow before it , resembling in its effect the wind passing over a field of <unk> , by its superior strength <unk> every ear to yield <unk> .
As for me , it made me tremble .
This voice was that of my father .
He came last , clothed in his splendid <unk> and holding in his hand the <unk> which your emperor presented him .
He was leaning on the shoulder of his favorite Selim , and he drove us all before him , as a shepherd would his <unk> <unk> .
My father , ” said Haydée , raising her head , “ was that illustrious man known in Europe under the name of Ali <unk> , <unk> of Yanina , and before whom <unk> trembled . ” Albert , without knowing why , started on hearing these words pronounced with such a haughty and <unk> accent ; it appeared to him as if there was something <unk> gloomy and terrible in the expression which <unk> from the brilliant eyes of Haydée at this moment ; she appeared like a <unk> <unk> a spectre , as she recalled to his mind the remembrance of the fearful death of this man , to the news of which all Europe had listened with horror .
“ Soon , ” said Haydée , “ we halted on our march , and found ourselves on the <unk> of a lake .
My mother pressed me to her <unk> heart , and at the distance of a few paces I saw my father , who was glancing anxiously around .
Four marble steps led down to the water ’ s edge , and below them was a boat floating on the tide .
<unk> “ From where we stood I could see in the middle of the lake a large <unk> mass ; it was the <unk> to which we were going .
This <unk> appeared to me to be at a considerable distance , perhaps on account of the darkness of the night , which prevented any object from being more than <unk> <unk> .
We stepped into the boat .
I remember well that the <unk> made no noise whatever in striking the water , and when I leaned over to ascertain the cause I saw that they were <unk> with the <unk> of our <unk> Besides the <unk> , the boat contained only the women , my father , mother , Selim , and myself .
The <unk> had remained on the shore of the lake , ready to cover our retreat ; they were kneeling on the <unk> of the marble steps , and in that manner intended making a <unk> of the three others , in case of pursuit .
Our <unk> flew before the wind .
‘ Why does the boat go so fast ? ’ asked I of my mother .
“ ‘ Silence , child !
Hush , we are flying ! ’ I did not understand .
Why should my father fly ? — he , the <unk> — he , before whom others were accustomed to fly — he , who had taken for his <unk> , ‘ They hate me ; then they fear me ! ’ “ It was , indeed , a flight which my father was trying to effect .
I have been told since that the <unk> of the castle of Yanina , fatigued with long service — — ” Here Haydée cast a significant glance at Monte Cristo , whose eyes had been <unk> on her countenance during the whole course of her <unk> .
The young girl then continued , speaking slowly , like a person who is either <unk> or <unk> some <unk> of the history which he is relating .
“ You were saying , <unk> , ” said Albert , who was paying the most <unk> attention to the <unk> , “ that the <unk> of Yanina , fatigued with long service — — ” “ Had treated with the <unk> <unk> , who had been sent by the <unk> to gain possession of the person of my father ; it was then that Ali <unk> — after having sent to the <unk> a French officer in whom he <unk> great confidence — resolved to retire to the asylum which he had long before prepared for himself , and which he called _ <unk> _ , or the refuge . ” “ And this officer , ” asked Albert , “ do you remember his name , <unk> ? ” Monte Cristo exchanged a rapid glance with the young girl , which was quite <unk> by Albert .
“ No , ” said she , “ I do not remember it just at this moment ; but if it should occur to me presently , I will tell you . ” Albert was on the point of <unk> his father ’ s name , when Monte Cristo gently held up his finger in <unk> of reproach ; the young man recollected his promise , and was silent .
“ It was towards this <unk> that we were <unk> .
A ground floor , ornamented with <unk> , <unk> its <unk> in the water , and another floor , looking on the lake , was all which was visible to the eye .
But beneath the ground floor , <unk> out into the island , was a large subterranean cavern , to which my mother , myself , and the women were conducted .
In this place were together <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> ; the <unk> contained <unk> of money in gold , and the <unk> were filled with <unk> pounds of <unk> .
“ <unk> the <unk> stood Selim , my father ’ s favorite , whom I mentioned to you just now .
He stood watch day and night with a <unk> provided with a lighted <unk> in his hand , and he had orders to blow up everything — <unk> , guards , women , gold , and Ali <unk> himself — at the first signal given by my father .
I remember well that the <unk> , convinced of the <unk> <unk> on which they held their lives , passed whole days and nights in praying , crying , and <unk> .
As for me , I can never forget the pale complexion and black eyes of the young soldier , and whenever the angel of death <unk> me to another world , I am quite sure I shall recognize Selim .
I cannot tell you how long we remained in this state ; at that period I did not even know what time meant .
Sometimes , but very rarely , my father summoned me and my mother to the <unk> of the palace ; these were hours of <unk> for me , as I never saw anything in the <unk> cavern but the gloomy <unk> of the <unk> and Selim ’ s <unk> <unk> .
My father was endeavoring to <unk> with his eager looks the <unk> verge of the horizon , examining attentively every black <unk> which appeared on the lake , while my mother , <unk> by his side , rested her head on his shoulder , and I played at his feet , <unk> everything I saw with that <unk> innocence of childhood which <unk> a charm round objects <unk> in themselves , but which in its eyes are <unk> with the greatest importance .
The <unk> of <unk> <unk> above us ; the castle of Yanina rose white and <unk> from the blue waters of the lake , and the immense masses of black <unk> which , viewed in the distance , gave the idea of <unk> <unk> to the rocks , were in reality gigantic <unk> and <unk> .
“ One morning my father sent for us ; my mother had been crying all the night , and was very wretched ; we found the <unk> calm , but <unk> than usual .
‘ Take courage , <unk> , ’ said he ; ‘ today arrives the <unk> of the master , and my fate will be decided .
If my pardon be complete , we shall return triumphant to Yanina ; if the news be <unk> , we must fly this night . ’ — ‘ But supposing our enemy should not allow us to do so ? ’ said my mother .
‘ Oh , make yourself easy on that head , ’ said Ali , smiling ; ‘ Selim and his <unk> <unk> will settle that matter .
They would be glad to see me dead , but they would not like themselves to die with me . ’ “ My mother only answered by <unk> to <unk> which she knew did not come from my father ’ s heart .
She prepared the <unk> water which he was in the habit of constantly drinking , — for since his <unk> at the <unk> he had been <unk> by the most violent fever , — after which she <unk> his white beard with <unk> <unk> , and lighted his <unk> , which he sometimes <unk> for hours together , quietly watching the <unk> of <unk> that ascended in <unk> clouds and gradually <unk> away in the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> he made such a sudden movement that I was <unk> with fear .
Then , without taking his eyes from the object which had first attracted his attention , he asked for his <unk> .
My mother gave it him , and as she did so , looked <unk> than the marble against which she leaned .
I saw my father ’ s hand tremble .
‘ A boat ! — two ! — three ! ’ murmured my , father ; — ‘ four ! ’ He then arose , seizing his arms and <unk> his pistols .
‘ <unk> , ’ said he to my mother , trembling <unk> , ‘ the instant <unk> which will decide everything .
In the space of half an hour we shall know the emperor ’ s answer .
Go into the cavern with Haydée . ’ — ‘ I will not quit you , ’ said <unk> ; ‘ if you die , my lord , I will die with you . ’ — ‘ Go to Selim ! ’ cried my father .
‘ Adieu , my lord , ’ murmured my mother , <unk> quietly to await the approach of death .
‘ Take away <unk> ! ’ said my father to his <unk> .
“ As for me , I had been forgotten in the general confusion ; I ran toward Ali <unk> ; he saw me hold out my arms to him , and he <unk> down and pressed my forehead with his lips .
Oh , how distinctly I remember that kiss ! — it was the last he ever gave me , and I feel as if it were still warm on my forehead .
On descending , we saw through the <unk> several <unk> which were gradually becoming more distinct to our view .
At first they appeared like black <unk> , and now they looked like birds <unk> the surface of the waves .
During this time , in the <unk> at my father ’ s feet , were seated twenty <unk> , concealed from view by an angle of the wall and watching with eager eyes the arrival of the <unk> .
They were armed with their long guns <unk> with <unk> and silver , and cartridges in great numbers were lying scattered on the floor .
My father looked at his watch , and <unk> up and down with a countenance expressive of the greatest anguish .
This was the scene which presented itself to my view as I quitted my father after that last kiss .
“ My mother and I traversed the gloomy passage leading to the cavern .
Selim was still at his post , and smiled sadly on us as we entered .
We <unk> our <unk> from the other end of the cavern , and sat down by Selim .
In great <unk> the devoted ones <unk> to each other ; and , young as I was , I quite understood that some <unk> danger was hanging over our heads . ” Albert had often heard — not from his father , for he never spoke on the subject , but from strangers — the description of the last moments of the <unk> of Yanina ; he had read different accounts of his death , but the story seemed to <unk> fresh meaning from the voice and expression of the young girl , and her <unk> accent and the melancholy expression of her countenance at once <unk> and <unk> him .
As to Haydée , these terrible <unk> seemed to have <unk> her for a moment , for she ceased speaking , her head leaning on her hand like a beautiful flower bowing beneath the violence of the storm ; and her eyes gazing on <unk> indicated that she was <unk> <unk> the green summit of the <unk> and the blue waters of the lake of Yanina , which , like a <unk> mirror , seemed to reflect the sombre picture which she <unk> .
Monte Cristo looked at her with an indescribable expression of interest and pity .
“ Go on , my child , ” said the count in the <unk> language .
<unk> Haydée looked up abruptly , as if the <unk> tones of Monte Cristo ’ s voice had awakened her from a dream ; and she resumed her <unk> .
“ It was about four o ’ clock in the afternoon , and although the day was brilliant <unk> , we were enveloped in the gloomy darkness of the cavern .
One single , solitary light was burning there , and it appeared like a star set in a heaven of <unk> ; it was Selim ’ s <unk> <unk> .
My mother was a Christian , and she <unk> .
Selim repeated from time to time the sacred words : ‘ God is great ! ’ However , my mother had still some hope .
As she was coming down , she thought she recognized the French officer who had been sent to <unk> , and in whom my father placed so much confidence ; for he knew that all the soldiers of the French emperor were naturally noble and generous .
She advanced some steps towards the staircase , and listened .
‘ They are approaching , ’ said she ; ‘ perhaps they bring us peace and liberty ! ’ “ ‘ What do you fear , <unk> ? ’ said Selim , in a voice at once so gentle and yet so proud .
‘ If they do not bring us peace , we will give them war ; if they do not bring life , we will give them death . ’ And he renewed the flame of his <unk> with a gesture which made one think of <unk> of old <unk> But I , being only a little child , was terrified by this <unk> courage , which appeared to me both ferocious and <unk> , and I recoiled with horror from the idea of the frightful death <unk> fire and flames which probably awaited us .
“ My mother experienced the same sensations , for I felt her tremble .
‘ <unk> , <unk> , ’ said I , ‘ are we really to be killed ? ’ And at the sound of my voice the <unk> redoubled their cries and prayers and <unk> .
‘ My child , ’ said <unk> , ‘ may God preserve you from ever wishing for that death which today you so much dread ! ’ Then , whispering to Selim , she asked what were her master ’ s orders .
‘ If he send me his <unk> , it will signify that the emperor ’ s intentions are not favorable , and I am to set fire to the powder ; if , on the contrary , he send me his ring , it will be a sign that the emperor <unk> him , and I am to <unk> the match and leave the <unk> <unk> . ’ — ‘ My friend , ’ said my mother , ‘ when your master ’ s orders arrive , if it is the <unk> which he sends , instead of <unk> us by that horrible death which we both so much dread , you will <unk> kill us with this same <unk> , will you not ? ’ — ‘ Yes , <unk> , ’ replied Selim <unk> .
“ Suddenly we heard loud cries ; and , listening , <unk> that they were cries of joy .
The name of the French officer who had been sent to <unk> <unk> on all sides amongst our <unk> ; it was evident that he brought the answer of the emperor , and that it was favorable . ” “ And do you not remember the Frenchman ’ s name ? ” said Morcerf , quite ready to aid the memory of the <unk> .
Monte Cristo made a sign to him to be silent .
“ I do not recollect it , ” said Haydée .
“ The noise increased ; steps were heard approaching nearer and nearer ; they were descending the steps leading to the cavern .
Selim made ready his <unk> .
Soon a figure appeared in the gray twilight at the entrance of the <unk> , formed by the reflection of the few rays of daylight which had found their way into this gloomy retreat .
‘ Who are you ? ’ cried Selim .
‘ But <unk> you may be , I charge you not to advance another step . ’ — ‘ Long live the emperor ! ’ said the figure .
‘ He <unk> a full pardon to the <unk> Ali , and not only gives him his life , but <unk> to him his fortune and his <unk> . ’ My mother uttered a cry of joy , and clasped me to her bosom .
‘ Stop , ’ said Selim , seeing that she was about to go out ; ‘ you see I have not yet received the ring , ’ — ‘ True , ’ said my mother .
And she fell on her knees , at the same time holding me up towards heaven , as if she desired , while praying to God in my <unk> , to raise me actually to his presence . ” And for the second time Haydée stopped , overcome by such violent emotion that the perspiration stood upon her pale brow , and her stifled voice seemed hardly able to find utterance , so <unk> and dry were her throat and lips .
<unk> Monte Cristo poured a little <unk> water into a glass , and presented it to her , saying with a <unk> in which was also a shade of command , — “ <unk> . ” Haydée dried her eyes , and continued : “ By this time our eyes , <unk> to the darkness , had recognized the messenger of the <unk> , — it was a friend .
Selim had also recognized him , but the brave young man only acknowledged one duty , which was to obey .
‘ In whose name do you come ? ’ said he to him .
‘ I come in the name of our master , Ali <unk> . ’ — ‘ If you come from Ali himself , ’ said Selim , ‘ you know what you were charged to <unk> to me ? ’ — ‘ Yes , ’ said the messenger , ‘ and I bring you his ring . ’ At these words he raised his hand above his head , to show the <unk> ; but it was too far off , and there was not light enough to <unk> Selim , where he was standing , to distinguish and recognize the object presented to his view .
‘ I do not see what you have in your hand , ’ said Selim .
‘ <unk> then , ’ said the messenger , ‘ or I will come nearer to you , if you prefer it . ’ — ‘ I will agree to neither one nor the other , ’ replied the young soldier ; ‘ place the object which I desire to see in the ray of light which <unk> there , and retire while I examine it . ’ — ‘ Be it so , ’ said the <unk> ; and he retired , after having first deposited the <unk> agreed on in the place pointed out to him by Selim .
“ Oh , how our hearts <unk> ; for it did , indeed , seem to be a ring which was placed there .
But was it my father ’ s ring ?
that was the question .
Selim , still holding in his hand the lighted match , walked towards the opening in the cavern , and , <unk> by the faint light which <unk> in through the mouth of the <unk> , picked up the <unk> .
“ ‘ It is well , ’ said he , <unk> it ; ‘ it is my master ’ s ring ! ’ And throwing the match on the ground , he <unk> on it and extinguished it .
The messenger uttered a cry of joy and <unk> his hands .
At this signal four soldiers of the <unk> <unk> suddenly appeared , and Selim fell , pierced by five blows .
Each man had <unk> him <unk> , and , intoxicated by their crime , though still pale with fear , they sought all over the cavern to discover if there was any fear of fire , after which they amused themselves by rolling on the <unk> of gold .
At this moment my mother seized me in her arms , and hurrying <unk> along numerous <unk> and <unk> known only to ourselves , she arrived at a private staircase of the <unk> , where was a scene of frightful tumult and confusion .
The lower rooms were entirely filled with <unk> ’ s troops ; that is to say , with our enemies .
Just as my mother was on the point of <unk> open a small door , we heard the voice of the <unk> <unk> in a loud and threatening tone .
My mother applied her eye to the <unk> between the <unk> ; I <unk> found a small opening which afforded me a view of the apartment and what was passing within .
‘ What do you want ? ’ said my father to some people who were holding a paper <unk> with characters of gold .
‘ What we want , ’ replied one , ‘ is to communicate to you the will of his <unk> .
Do you see this <unk> ? ’ — ‘ I do , ’ said my father .
‘ Well , read it ; he demands your head . ’ <unk> “ My father answered with a loud laugh , which was more frightful than even <unk> would have been , and he had not ceased when two reports of a pistol were heard ; he had fired them himself , and had killed two men .
The <unk> , who were <unk> at my father ’ s feet , now sprang up and fired , and the room was filled with fire and smoke .
At the same instant the firing began on the other side , and the balls penetrated the <unk> all round us .
Oh , how noble did the grand <unk> my father look at that moment , in the midst of the flying bullets , his <unk> in his hand , and his face <unk> with the powder of his enemies !
and how he terrified them , even then , and made them fly before him !
‘ Selim , Selim ! ’ cried he , ‘ <unk> of the fire , do your duty ! ’ — ‘ Selim is dead , ’ replied a voice which seemed to come from the depths of the earth , ‘ and you are lost , Ali ! ’ At the same moment an <unk> was heard , and the <unk> of the room in which my father was sitting was suddenly torn up and <unk> to <unk> — the troops were firing from <unk> .
Three or four <unk> fell with their bodies <unk> <unk> with wounds .
“ My father <unk> aloud , plunged his fingers into the holes which the balls had made , and tore up one of the planks entire .
But immediately through this opening twenty more <unk> were fired , and the flame , rushing up like fire from the <unk> of a <unk> , soon reached the <unk> , which it quickly <unk> .
In the midst of all this frightful tumult and these <unk> cries , two reports , <unk> distinct , followed by two <unk> more <unk> than all , <unk> me with terror .
These two <unk> had <unk> wounded my father , and it was he who had given utterance to these frightful cries .
However , he remained standing , <unk> to a window .
My mother tried to force the door , that she might go and die with him , but it was fastened on the inside .
All around him were lying the <unk> , <unk> in <unk> <unk> , while two or three who were only slightly wounded were trying to escape by <unk> from the windows .
At this crisis the whole <unk> suddenly gave way , my father fell on one knee , and at the same moment twenty hands were thrust forth , armed with <unk> , pistols , and <unk> — twenty blows were <unk> directed against one man , and my father disappeared in a <unk> of fire and smoke <unk> by these <unk> , and which seemed like hell itself opening beneath his feet .
I felt myself fall to the ground , my mother had fainted . ” Haydée ’ s arms fell by her side , and she uttered a deep groan , at the same time looking towards the count as if to ask if he were satisfied with her obedience to his <unk> .
Monte Cristo arose and approached her , took her hand , and said to her in <unk> : “ <unk> yourself , my dear child , and take courage in <unk> that there is a God who will <unk> <unk> . ” “ It is a frightful story , count , ” said Albert , terrified at the <unk> of Haydée ’ s countenance , “ and I reproach myself now for having been so cruel and <unk> in my request . ” “ Oh , it is nothing , ” said Monte Cristo .
Then , <unk> the young girl on the head , he continued , “ Haydée is very <unk> , and she sometimes even finds consolation in the <unk> of her misfortunes . ” “ Because , my lord , ” said Haydée eagerly , “ my miseries recall to me the remembrance of your goodness . ” Albert looked at her with curiosity , for she had not yet related what he most desired to know , — how she had become the slave of the count .
Haydée saw at a glance the same expression <unk> the <unk> of her two <unk> ; she continued : “ When my mother recovered her senses we were before the <unk> .
‘ <unk> , ’ said she , ‘ but spare the honor of the widow of Ali . ’ — ‘ It is not to me to whom you must address yourself , ’ said <unk> .
“ ‘ To whom , then ? ’ — ‘ To your new master . ’ “ ‘ Who and where is he ? ’ — ‘ He is here . ’ “ And <unk> pointed out one who had more than any <unk> to the death of my father , ” said Haydée , in a tone of <unk> anger .
“ Then , ” said Albert , “ you became the property of this man ? ” <unk> “ No , ” replied Haydée , “ he did not dare to keep us , so we were sold to some <unk> who were going to <unk> .
We traversed Greece , and arrived half dead at the <unk> gates .
They were surrounded by a crowd of people , who opened a way for us to pass , when suddenly my mother , having looked closely at an object which was <unk> their attention , uttered a piercing cry and fell to the ground , pointing as she did so to a head which was placed over the gates , and beneath which were <unk> these words : ‘ _ This is the head of Ali <unk> , <unk> of Yanina . _ ’ “ I cried bitterly , and tried to raise my mother from the earth , but she was dead !
I was taken to the <unk> , and was purchased by a rich <unk> .
He caused me to be <unk> , gave me masters , and when I was <unk> years of age he sold me to the <unk> <unk> . ” “ Of whom I bought her , ” said Monte Cristo , “ as I told you , Albert , with the <unk> which formed a match to the one I had made into a box for the purpose of holding my <unk> <unk> . ” “ Oh , you are good , you are great , my lord ! ” said Haydée , <unk> the count ’ s hand , “ and I am very fortunate in belonging to such a master ! ” Albert remained quite bewildered with all that he had seen and heard .
“ Come , finish your cup of coffee , ” said Monte Cristo ; “ the history is ended . ” Chapter <unk> .
We hear From Yanina If Valentine could have seen the trembling step and agitated countenance of Franz when he quitted the chamber of M. Noirtier , even she would have been <unk> to pity him .
Villefort had only just given utterance to a few <unk> <unk> , and then retired to his study , where he received about two hours afterwards the following letter : “ After all the <unk> which were made this morning , M. Noirtier de Villefort must see the utter <unk> of any alliance being formed between his family and that of M. Franz d ’ Épinay .
M. d ’ Épinay must say that he is shocked and astonished that M. de Villefort , who appeared to be aware of all the circumstances <unk> this morning , should not have anticipated him in this <unk> . ” No one who had seen the magistrate at this moment , so thoroughly <unk> by the recent <unk> <unk> of circumstances , would have supposed for an instant that he had anticipated the <unk> ; although it certainly never had occurred to him that his father would carry <unk> , or rather <unk> , so far as to relate such a history .
And in justice to Villefort , it must be understood that M. Noirtier , who never cared for the opinion of his son on any subject , had always <unk> to explain the affair to Villefort , so that he had all his life entertained the belief that General de <unk> , or the Baron d ’ Épinay , as he was <unk> <unk> , according as the <unk> wished to <unk> him by his own family name , or by the title which had been <unk> on him , fell the victim of <unk> , and not that he was killed fairly in a duel .
This harsh letter , coming as it did from a man generally so <unk> and respectful , struck a mortal blow at the pride of Villefort .
<unk> had he read the letter , when his wife entered .
The sudden departure of Franz , after being summoned by M. Noirtier , had so much astonished everyone , that the position of Madame de Villefort , left alone with the notary and the witnesses , became every moment more <unk> .
<unk> to bear it no longer , she arose and left the room ; saying she would go and make some inquiries into the cause of his sudden disappearance .
M. de Villefort ’ s <unk> on the subject were very limited and <unk> ; he told her , in fact , that an explanation had taken place between M. Noirtier , M. d ’ Épinay , and himself , and that the marriage of Valentine and Franz would consequently be broken off .
This was an awkward and unpleasant thing to have to report to those who were waiting .
She therefore contented herself with saying that M. Noirtier having at the <unk> of the discussion been attacked by a sort of <unk> fit , the affair would necessarily be <unk> for some days longer .
This news , false as it was following so <unk> in the train of the two similar misfortunes which had so recently occurred , evidently astonished the <unk> , and they retired without a word .
During this time Valentine , at once terrified and happy , after having embraced and thanked the feeble old man for thus breaking with a single blow the chain which she had been accustomed to consider as <unk> , asked leave to retire to her own room , in order to recover her composure .
Noirtier looked the permission which she <unk> .
But instead of going to her own room , Valentine , having once gained her liberty , entered the gallery , and , opening a small door at the end of it , found herself at once in the garden .
In the midst of all the strange events which had <unk> one on the other , an <unk> sentiment of dread had taken possession of Valentine ’ s mind .
She expected every moment that she should see Morrel appear , pale and trembling , to <unk> the <unk> of the contract , like the <unk> of <unk> in _ The <unk> of <unk> _ .
It was high time for her to make her appearance at the gate , for Maximilian had long awaited her coming .
He had half guessed what was going on when he saw Franz quit the cemetery with M. de Villefort .
He followed M. d ’ Épinay , saw him enter , afterwards go out , and then <unk> with Albert and Château-Renaud .
He had no longer any doubts as to the nature of the <unk> ; he therefore quickly went to the gate in the <unk> , prepared to hear the result of the <unk> , and very certain that Valentine would hasten to him the first moment she should be set at liberty .
He was not mistaken ; <unk> through the <unk> of the wooden <unk> , he soon discovered the young girl , who cast aside all her usual precautions and walked at once to the barrier .
The first glance which Maximilian directed towards her entirely reassured him , and the first words she spoke made his heart bound with delight .
“ We are saved ! ” said Valentine .
“ <unk> ? ” repeated Morrel , not being able to conceive such intense happiness ; “ by whom ? ” “ By my grandfather .
Oh , Morrel , pray love him for all his goodness to us ! ” Morrel <unk> to love him with all his soul ; and at that moment he could safely promise to do so , for he felt as though it were not enough to love him merely as a friend or even as a father , he <unk> him as a <unk> .
“ But tell me , Valentine , how has it all been effected ?
What strange means has he used to <unk> this blessed end ? ” Valentine was on the point of relating all that had passed , but she suddenly remembered that in doing so she must reveal a terrible secret which concerned others as well as her grandfather , and she said : “ At some future time I will tell you all about it . ” “ But when will that be ? ” “ When I am your wife . ” The conversation had now turned upon a <unk> so pleasing to Morrel , that he was ready to <unk> to anything that Valentine thought fit to propose , and he likewise felt that a piece of intelligence such as he just heard ought to be more than sufficient to content him for one day .
However , he would not leave without the promise of seeing Valentine again the next night .
Valentine promised all that Morrel required of her , and certainly it was less difficult now for her to believe that she should marry Maximilian than it was an hour ago to assure herself that she should not marry Franz .
During the time occupied by the interview we have just <unk> , Madame de Villefort had gone to visit M. Noirtier .
The old man looked at her with that stern and <unk> expression with which he was accustomed to receive her .
“ Sir , ” said she , “ it is <unk> for me to tell you that Valentine ’ s marriage is broken off , since it was here that the affair was concluded . ” Noirtier ’ s countenance remained <unk> .
“ But one thing I can tell you , of which I do not think you are aware ; that is , that I have always been opposed to this marriage , and that the contract was entered into entirely without my consent or approbation . ” Noirtier regarded his <unk> with the look of a man <unk> an explanation .
“ Now that this marriage , which I know you so much <unk> , is done away with , I come to you on an <unk> which neither M. de Villefort nor Valentine could <unk> <unk> . ” Noirtier ’ s eyes demanded the nature of her mission .
“ I come to entreat you , sir , ” continued Madame de Villefort , “ as the only one who has the right of doing so , <unk> as I am the only one who will receive no personal benefit from the <unk> , — I come to entreat you to restore , not your love , for that she has always possessed , but to restore your fortune to your <unk> . ” There was a doubtful expression in Noirtier ’ s eyes ; he was evidently trying to discover the motive of this proceeding , and he could not succeed in doing so .
“ May I hope , sir , ” said Madame de Villefort , “ that your intentions accord with my request ? ” Noirtier made a sign that they did .
“ In that case , sir , ” <unk> Madame de Villefort , “ I will leave you overwhelmed with gratitude and happiness at your <unk> <unk> to my wishes . ” She then bowed to M. Noirtier and retired .
The next day M. Noirtier sent for the notary ; the first will was torn up and a second made , in which he left the whole of his fortune to Valentine , on condition that she should never be separated from him .
It was then generally reported that Mademoiselle de Villefort , the <unk> of the marquis and <unk> of Saint-Méran , had regained the good <unk> of her grandfather , and that she would <unk> be in possession of an income of <unk> livres .
While all the <unk> relative to the <unk> of the <unk> were being carried on at the house of M. de Villefort , Monte Cristo had paid his visit to the Count of Morcerf , who , in order to lose no time in <unk> to M. Danglars ’ wishes , and at the same time to pay all due <unk> to his position in society , <unk> his uniform of <unk> , which he ornamented with all his <unk> , and thus <unk> , ordered his <unk> horses and drove to the Rue de la <unk> d ’ <unk> .
Danglars was <unk> his <unk> accounts , and it was perhaps not the most favorable moment for finding him in his best <unk> .
At the first sight of his old friend , Danglars assumed his <unk> air , and settled himself in his <unk> .
Morcerf , usually so stiff and formal , <unk> the banker in an <unk> and smiling manner , and , feeling sure that the <unk> he was about to make would be well received , he did not consider it necessary to <unk> any <unk> in order to gain his end , but went at once straight to the point .
<unk> “ Well , baron , ” said he , “ here I am at last ; some time has elapsed since our plans were formed , and they are not yet executed . ” Morcerf paused at these words , quietly waiting till the cloud should have <unk> which had gathered on the brow of Danglars , and which he attributed to his silence ; but , on the contrary , to his great surprise , it grew <unk> and <unk> .
“ To what do you <unk> , monsieur ? ” said Danglars ; as if he were trying in vain to guess at the possible meaning of the general ’ s words .
“ Ah , ” said Morcerf , “ I see you are a <unk> for forms , my dear sir , and you would remind me that the <unk> <unk> should not be <unk> .
_ Ma foi _ , I beg your pardon , but as I have but one son , and it is the first time I have ever thought of marrying him , I am still <unk> my <unk> , you know ; come , I will <unk> . ” And Morcerf with a forced smile arose , and , making a low bow to M. Danglars , said : “ Baron , I have the honor of asking of you the hand of Mademoiselle Eugénie Danglars for my son , the <unk> Albert de Morcerf . ” But Danglars , instead of receiving this address in the favorable manner which Morcerf had expected , <unk> his brow , and without <unk> the count , who was still standing , to take a seat , he said : “ Monsieur , it will be necessary to reflect before I give you an answer . ” “ To reflect ? ” said Morcerf , more and more astonished ; “ have you not had enough time for reflection during the eight years which have elapsed since this marriage was first <unk> between us ? ” “ Count , ” said the banker , “ things are constantly <unk> in the world to induce us to lay aside our most established opinions , or at all events to cause us to <unk> them according to the change of circumstances , which may have placed affairs in a totally different light to that in which we at first viewed them . ” “ I do not understand you , baron , ” said Morcerf .
“ What I mean to say is this , sir , — that during the last fortnight <unk> circumstances have occurred — — ” “ Excuse me , ” said Morcerf , “ but is it a play we are acting ? ” “ A play ? ” “ Yes , for it is like one ; pray let us come more to the point , and endeavor thoroughly to understand each other . ” “ That is quite my desire . ” “ You have seen M. de Monte Cristo have you not ? ” “ I see him very often , ” said Danglars , drawing himself up ; “ he is a particular friend of mine . ” “ Well , in one of your late <unk> with him , you said that I appeared to be <unk> and <unk> concerning this marriage , did you not ? ” “ I did say so . ” “ Well , here I am , <unk> at once that I am really neither the one nor the other , by <unk> you to keep your promise on that <unk> . ” Danglars did not answer .
“ Have you so soon changed your mind , ” added Morcerf , “ or have you only <unk> my request that you may have the pleasure of seeing me <unk> ? ” Danglars , seeing that if he continued the conversation in the same tone in which he had begun it , the whole thing might turn out to his own <unk> , turned to Morcerf , and said : “ Count , you must doubtless be surprised at my reserve , and I assure you it costs me much to act in such a manner towards you ; but , believe me when I say that <unk> necessity has imposed the painful task upon me . ” “ These are all so many empty words , my dear sir , ” said Morcerf : “ they might satisfy a new acquaintance , but the Comte de Morcerf does not rank in that list ; and when a man like him comes to another , <unk> to him his <unk> word , and this man <unk> to <unk> the <unk> , he has at least a right to exact from him a good reason for so doing . ” Danglars was a coward , but did not wish to appear so ; he was <unk> at the tone which Morcerf had just assumed .
“ I am not without a good reason for my conduct , ” replied the banker .
“ What do you mean to say ? ” “ I mean to say that I have a good reason , but that it is difficult to explain . ” “ You must be aware , at all events , that it is impossible for me to understand motives before they are explained to me ; but one thing at least is clear , which is , that you <unk> <unk> yourself with my family . ” “ No , sir , ” said Danglars ; “ I merely <unk> my decision , that is all . ” “ And do you really <unk> yourself that I shall yield to all your <unk> , and quietly and <unk> await the time of again being received into your good <unk> ? ” “ Then , count , if you will not wait , we must look upon these projects as if they had never been entertained . ” The count bit his lips till the blood almost started , to prevent the <unk> of anger which his proud and <unk> temper scarcely allowed him to restrain ; understanding , however , that in the present state of things the laugh would decidedly be against him , he turned from the door , towards which he had been <unk> his steps , and again <unk> the banker .
A cloud settled on his brow , <unk> decided anxiety and uneasiness , instead of the expression of offended pride which had lately reigned there .
“ My dear Danglars , ” said Morcerf , “ we have been acquainted for many years , and consequently we ought to make some <unk> for each other ’ s <unk> .
You owe me an explanation , and really it is but fair that I should know what circumstance has occurred to <unk> my son of your favor . ” “ It is from no personal <unk> towards the viscount , that is all I can say , sir , ” replied Danglars , who resumed his <unk> manner as soon as he perceived that Morcerf was a little softened and <unk> down .
“ And towards whom do you bear this personal <unk> , then ? ” said Morcerf , turning pale with anger .
The expression of the count ’ s face had not remained <unk> by the banker ; he fixed on him a look of greater assurance than before , and said : “ You may , perhaps , be better satisfied that I should not go farther into particulars . ” A <unk> of <unk> rage shook the whole frame of the count , and making a violent effort over himself , he said : “ I have a right to insist on your giving me an explanation .
Is it Madame de Morcerf who has displeased you ?
Is it my fortune which you find <unk> ?
Is it because my opinions <unk> from yours ? ” “ Nothing of the kind , sir , ” replied Danglars : “ if such had been the case , I only should have been to blame , <unk> as I was aware of all these things when I made the engagement .
No , do not seek any longer to discover the reason .
I really am quite ashamed to have been the cause of your <unk> such severe <unk> ; let us drop the subject , and <unk> the middle course of delay , which <unk> neither a <unk> nor an engagement .
_ Ma foi _ , there is no hurry .
My daughter is only seventeen years old , and your son <unk> .
While we wait , time will be <unk> , events will succeed each other ; things which in the evening look dark and obscure , appear but too clearly in the light of morning , and sometimes the utterance of one word , or the <unk> of a single day , will reveal the most cruel <unk> . ” “ <unk> , did you say , sir ? ” cried Morcerf , turning livid with rage .
“ Does anyone dare to <unk> me ? ” “ Monsieur , I told you that I considered it best to avoid all explanation . ” “ Then , sir , I am <unk> to submit to your refusal ? ” “ Yes , sir , although I assure you the refusal is as painful for me to give as it is for you to receive , for I had <unk> on the honor of your alliance , and the breaking off of a marriage contract always <unk> the lady more than the gentleman . ” “ <unk> , sir , ” said Morcerf , “ we will speak no more on the subject . ” And <unk> his gloves in anger , he left the apartment .
Danglars observed that during the whole conversation Morcerf had never once dared to ask if it was on his own account that Danglars recalled his word .
That evening he had a long <unk> with several friends ; and M. Cavalcanti , who had remained in the drawing-room with the ladies , was the last to leave the banker ’ s house .
The next morning , as soon as he awoke , Danglars asked for the newspapers ; they were brought to him ; he laid aside three or four , and at last fixed on _ l ’ <unk> _ , the paper of which Beauchamp was the chief <unk> .
He hastily tore off the cover , opened the journal with nervous <unk> , passed <unk> over the Paris <unk> , and arriving at the <unk> intelligence , stopped with a malicious smile , at a paragraph <unk> _ We hear from Yanina . _ “ Very good , ” observed Danglars , after having read the paragraph ; “ here is a little article on Colonel Fernand , which , if I am not mistaken , would render the explanation which the Comte de Morcerf required of me perfectly unnecessary . ” At the same moment , that is , at nine o ’ clock in the morning , Albert de Morcerf , dressed in a black coat <unk> up to his chin , might have been seen walking with a quick and agitated step in the direction of Monte Cristo ’ s house in the Champs-Élysées .
When he presented himself at the gate the porter informed him that the Count had gone out about half an hour previously .
“ Did he take Baptistin with him ? ” “ No , my lord . ” “ <unk> him , then ; I wish to speak to him . ” The concierge went to seek the valet de chambre , and returned with him in an instant .
“ My good friend , ” said Albert , “ I beg pardon for my <unk> , but I was anxious to know from your own mouth if your master was really out or not . ” “ He is really out , sir , ” replied Baptistin .
“ <unk> , even to me ? ” “ I know how happy my master always is to receive the <unk> , ” said Baptistin ; “ and I should therefore never think of including him in any general order . ” “ You are right ; and now I wish to see him on an affair of great importance .
Do you think it will be long before he comes in ? ” “ No , I think not , for he ordered his breakfast at ten o ’ clock . ” “ Well , I will go and take a turn in the Champs-Élysées , and at ten o ’ clock I will return here ; meanwhile , if the count should come in , will you beg him not to go out again without seeing me ? ” “ You may depend on my doing so , sir , ” said Baptistin .
Albert left the cab in which he had come at the count ’ s door , intending to take a turn on foot .
As he was passing the <unk> des <unk> , he thought he saw the count ’ s horses standing at <unk> ’ s <unk> ; he approached , and soon recognized the coachman .
“ Is the count <unk> in the gallery ? ” said Morcerf .
“ Yes , sir , ” replied the coachman .
While he was speaking , Albert had heard the report of two or three <unk> .
He entered , and on his way met the waiter .
“ Excuse me , my lord , ” said the lad ; “ but will you have the kindness to wait a moment ? ” “ What for , <unk> ? ” asked Albert , who , being a constant visitor there , did not understand this opposition to his entrance .
“ Because the person who is now in the gallery <unk> being alone , and never <unk> in the presence of anyone . ” “ Not even before you , <unk> ?
Then who <unk> his pistol ? ” “ His servant . ” “ A <unk> ? ” “ A <unk> . ” “ It is he , then . ” “ Do you know this gentleman ? ” “ Yes , and I am come to look for him ; he is a friend of mine . ” “ Oh , that is quite another thing , then .
I will go immediately and inform him of your arrival . ” And <unk> , urged by his own curiosity , entered the gallery ; a second afterwards , Monte Cristo appeared on the threshold .
“ I ask your pardon , my dear count , ” said Albert , “ for following you here , and I must first tell you that it was not the fault of your servants that I did so ; I alone am to blame for the <unk> .
I went to your house , and they told me you were out , but that they expected you home at ten o ’ clock to breakfast .
I was walking about in order to pass away the time till ten o ’ clock , when I caught sight of your carriage and horses . ” “ What you have just said <unk> me to hope that you intend <unk> with me . ” <unk> “ No , thank you , I am thinking of other things besides breakfast just now ; perhaps we may take that <unk> at a later hour and in worse company . ” “ What on earth are you talking of ? ” “ I am to fight today . ” “ For what ? ” “ For the sake of fighting ! ” “ Yes , I understand that , but what is the quarrel ?
People fight for all sorts of reasons , you know . ” “ I fight in the cause of honor . ” “ Ah , that is something serious . ” “ So serious , that I come to beg you to render me a service . ” “ What is it ? ” “ To be my second . ” “ That is a serious matter , and we will not <unk> it here ; let us speak of nothing till we get home .
Ali , bring me some water . ” The count turned up his <unk> , and passed into the little <unk> where the gentlemen were accustomed to <unk> their hands after <unk> .
“ Come in , my lord , ” said <unk> in a low tone , “ and I will show you something <unk> . ” Morcerf entered , and in place of the usual <unk> , he saw some <unk> fixed against the wall .
At a distance Albert thought it was a complete suit , for he counted from the <unk> to the ten .
“ Ah , <unk> , ” said Albert , “ I see you were preparing for a game of cards . ” “ No , ” said the count , “ I was making a suit . ” “ How ? ” said Albert .
“ Those are really <unk> and <unk> which you see , but my <unk> have turned them into <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . ” Albert approached .
In fact , the bullets had actually pierced the cards in the exact places which the painted signs would otherwise have occupied , the lines and <unk> being as <unk> kept as if they had been <unk> with <unk> .
In going up to the <unk> Morcerf picked up two or three <unk> that had been <unk> enough to come within the <unk> of the count ’ s pistol .
“ _ <unk> ! _ ” said Morcerf .
“ What would you have , my dear viscount ? ” said Monte Cristo , <unk> his hands on the <unk> which Ali had brought him ; “ I must occupy my leisure moments in some way or other .
But come , I am waiting for you . ” Both men entered Monte Cristo ’ s carriage , which in the course of a few minutes deposited them safely at No .
30 .
Monte Cristo took Albert into his study , and pointing to a seat , placed another for himself .
“ Now let us talk the matter over quietly , ” said the count .
“ You see I am perfectly composed , ” said Albert .
“ With whom are you going to fight ? ” “ With Beauchamp . ” “ One of your friends ! ” “ Of course ; it is always with friends that one <unk> . ” “ I suppose you have some cause of quarrel ? ” “ I have . ” <unk> “ What has he done to you ? ” “ There appeared in his journal last night — but wait , and read for yourself . ” And Albert handed over the paper to the count , who read as follows : “ A correspondent at Yanina <unk> us of a fact of which until now we had remained in ignorance .
The castle which formed the protection of the town was given up to the <unk> by a French officer named Fernand , in whom the grand <unk> , Ali <unk> , had <unk> the greatest confidence . ” “ Well , ” said Monte Cristo , “ what do you see in that to <unk> you ? ” “ What do I see in it ? ” “ Yes ; what does it signify to you if the castle of Yanina was given up by a French officer ? ” “ It <unk> to my father , the Count of Morcerf , whose Christian name is Fernand ! ” “ Did your father serve under Ali <unk> ? ” “ Yes ; that is to say , he fought for the independence of the <unk> , and hence <unk> the <unk> . ” “ Oh , my dear viscount , do talk reason ! ” “ I do not desire to do otherwise . ” “ Now , just tell me who the devil should know in France that the officer Fernand and the Count of Morcerf are one and the same person ?
and who cares now about Yanina , which was taken as long ago as the year <unk> or <unk> ? ” “ That just shows the <unk> of this <unk> .
They have allowed all this time to <unk> , and then all of a sudden <unk> up events which have been forgotten to furnish <unk> for <unk> , in order to <unk> the <unk> of our high position .
I <unk> my father ’ s name , and I do not choose that the shadow of disgrace should <unk> it .
I am going to Beauchamp , in whose journal this paragraph appears , and I shall insist on his <unk> the <unk> before two witnesses . ” “ Beauchamp will never <unk> . ” “ Then we must fight . ” “ No you will not , for he will tell you , what is very true , that perhaps there were fifty officers in the Greek army bearing the same name . ” “ We will fight , nevertheless .
I will <unk> that <unk> on my father ’ s character .
My father , who was such a brave soldier , whose career was so brilliant — — ” “ Oh , well , he will add , ‘ We are <unk> in believing that this Fernand is not the illustrious Count of Morcerf , who also bears the same Christian name . ’ ” “ I am determined not to be content with anything short of an entire <unk> . ” “ And you intend to make him do it in the presence of two witnesses , do you ? ” “ Yes . ” “ You do wrong . ” “ Which means , I suppose , that you refuse the service which I asked of you ? ” “ You know my theory regarding <unk> ; I told you my opinion on that subject , if you remember , when we were at Rome . ” “ Nevertheless , my dear count , I found you this morning engaged in an occupation but little <unk> with the <unk> you <unk> to entertain . ” “ Because , my dear fellow , you understand one must never be eccentric .
If one ’ s lot is cast among <unk> , it is necessary to study folly .
I shall perhaps find myself one day called out by some <unk> <unk> , who has no more real cause of quarrel with me than you have with Beauchamp ; he may take me to task for some foolish trifle or other , he will bring his witnesses , or will insult me in some public place , and I am expected to kill him for all that . ” “ You admit that you would fight , then ?
Well , if so , why do you object to my doing so ? ” “ I do not say that you ought not to fight , I only say that a duel is a serious thing , and ought not to be <unk> without due reflection . ” “ Did he reflect before he <unk> my father ? ” “ If he spoke hastily , and <unk> that he did so , you ought to be satisfied . ” “ Ah , my dear count , you are far too <unk> . ” “ And you are far too <unk> .
<unk> , for instance , and do not be angry at what I am going to say — — ” “ Well . ” “ <unk> the <unk> to be really true ? ” “ A son ought not to submit to such a <unk> on his father ’ s honor . ” “ _ Ma foi ! _ we live in times when there is much to which we must submit . ” “ That is precisely the fault of the age . ” “ And do you <unk> to <unk> it ? ” “ Yes , as far as I am <unk> concerned . ” “ Well , you are indeed <unk> , my dear fellow ! ” “ Yes , I own it . ” “ Are you quite <unk> to good advice ? ” “ Not when it comes from a friend . ” “ And do you account me that title ? ” “ Certainly I do . ” “ Well , then , before going to Beauchamp with your witnesses , seek further information on the subject . ” “ From whom ? ” “ From Haydée . ” “ Why , what can be the use of <unk> a woman up in the affair ? — what can she do in it ? ” “ She can declare to you , for example , that your father had no hand whatever in the <unk> and death of the <unk> ; or if by chance he had , indeed , the misfortune to — — ” “ I have told you , my dear count , that I would not for one moment admit of such a <unk> . ” “ You <unk> this means of information , then ? ” “ I do — most decidedly . ” “ Then let me offer one more word of advice . ” “ Do so , then , but let it be the last . ” “ You do not wish to hear it , perhaps ? ” “ On the contrary , I request it . ” “ Do not take any witnesses with you when you go to Beauchamp — visit him alone . ” “ That would be contrary to all custom . ” “ Your case is not an ordinary one . ” “ And what is your reason for <unk> me to go alone ? ” “ Because then the affair will rest between you and Beauchamp . ” “ <unk> yourself . ” “ I will do so .
If Beauchamp be disposed to <unk> , you ought at least to give him the opportunity of doing it of his own free will , — the satisfaction to you will be the same .
If , on the contrary , he <unk> to do so , it will then be quite time enough to admit two strangers into your secret . ” “ They will not be strangers , they will be friends . ” “ Ah , but the friends of today are the enemies of tomorrow ; Beauchamp , for instance . ” “ So you recommend — — ” “ I recommend you to be prudent . ” “ Then you advise me to go alone to Beauchamp ? ” “ I do , and I will tell you why .
When you wish to obtain some <unk> from a man ’ s <unk> , you must avoid even the appearance of wishing to wound it . ” “ I believe you are right . ” “ I am glad of it . ” “ Then I will go alone . ” “ Go ; but you would do better still by not going at all . ” “ That is impossible . ” “ Do so , then ; it will be a <unk> plan than the first which you proposed . ” “ But if , in spite of all my precautions , I am at last obliged to fight , will you not be my second ? ” “ My dear viscount , ” said Monte Cristo gravely , “ you must have seen before today that at all times and in all places I have been at your disposal , but the service which you have just demanded of me is one which it is out of my power to render you . ” “ Why ? ” “ Perhaps you may know at some future period , and in the mean time I request you to excuse my <unk> to put you in possession of my reasons . ” “ Well , I will have Franz and Château-Renaud ; they will be the very men for it . ” “ Do so , then . ” “ But if I do fight , you will surely not object to giving me a lesson or two in <unk> and <unk> ? ” “ That , too , is impossible . ” “ What a singular being you are ! — you will not interfere in anything . ” “ You are right — that is the principle on which I wish to act . ” “ We will say no more about it , then .
Good-bye , count . ” Morcerf took his hat , and left the room .
He found his carriage at the door , and doing his utmost to restrain his anger he went at once to find Beauchamp , who was in his office .
It was a gloomy , <unk> apartment , such as <unk> ’ <unk> have always been from time <unk> .
The servant announced M. Albert de Morcerf .
Beauchamp repeated the name to himself , as though he could scarcely believe that he had heard <unk> , and then gave orders for him to be admitted .
Albert entered .
Beauchamp uttered an exclamation of surprise on seeing his friend <unk> over and <unk> under foot all the newspapers which were <unk> about the room .
“ This way , this way , my dear Albert ! ” said he , holding out his hand to the young man .
“ Are you out of your senses , or do you come <unk> to take breakfast with me ?
<unk> and find a seat — there is one by that <unk> , which is the only thing in the room to remind me that there are other leaves in the world besides leaves of paper . ” “ Beauchamp , ” said Albert , “ it is of your journal that I come to speak . ” “ Indeed ?
What do you wish to say about it ? ” “ I desire that a statement contained in it should be <unk> . ” “ To what do you <unk> ?
But pray sit down . ” “ Thank you , ” said Albert , with a cold and formal bow .
“ Will you now have the kindness to explain the nature of the statement which has displeased you ? ” “ An <unk> has been made which <unk> the honor of a member of my family . ” “ What is it ? ” said Beauchamp , much surprised ; “ surely you must be mistaken . ” “ The story sent you from Yanina . ” “ Yanina ? ” “ Yes ; really you appear to be totally ignorant of the cause which brings me here . ” “ Such is really the case , I assure you , upon my honor !
<unk> , give me yesterday ’ s paper , ” cried Beauchamp .
“ Here , I have brought mine with me , ” replied Albert .
Beauchamp took the paper , and read the article to which Albert pointed in an <unk> .
“ You see it is a serious <unk> , ” said Morcerf , when Beauchamp had finished the <unk> of the paragraph .
“ Is the officer <unk> to a relation of yours , then ? ” demanded the <unk> .
“ Yes , ” said Albert , <unk> .
“ Well , what do you wish me to do for you ? ” said Beauchamp <unk> .
“ My dear Beauchamp , I wish you to <unk> this statement . ” Beauchamp looked at Albert with a benevolent expression .
“ Come , ” said he , “ this matter will want a good deal of talking over ; a <unk> is always a serious thing , you know .
<unk> down , and I will read it again . ” Albert resumed his seat , and Beauchamp read , with more attention than at first , the lines <unk> by his friend .
“ Well , ” said Albert in a determined tone , “ you see that your paper has <unk> a member of my family , and I insist on a <unk> being made . ” “ You insist ? ” “ Yes , I insist . ” “ <unk> me to remind you that you are not in the Chamber , my dear viscount . ” “ Nor do I wish to be there , ” replied the young man , rising .
“ I repeat that I am determined to have the <unk> of yesterday <unk> .
You have known me long enough , ” continued Albert , <unk> his lips convulsively , for he saw that Beauchamp ’ s anger was beginning to rise , — “ you have been my friend , and therefore sufficiently intimate with me to be aware that I am likely to <unk> my resolution on this point . ” “ If I have been your friend , Morcerf , your present manner of speaking would almost lead me to forget that I ever bore that title .
But wait a moment , do not let us get angry , or at least not yet .
You are irritated and vexed — tell me how this Fernand is related to you ? ” “ He is merely my father , ” said Albert — “ M.
Fernand <unk> , Count of Morcerf , an old soldier who has fought in twenty <unk> and whose honorable <unk> they would <unk> as <unk> of disgrace . ” “ Is it your father ? ” said Beauchamp ; “ that is quite another thing .
Then I can well understand your indignation , my dear Albert .
I will look at it again ; ” and he read the paragraph for the third time , laying a <unk> on each word as he proceeded .
“ But the paper <unk> <unk> this Fernand with your father . ” <unk> “ No ; but the connection will be seen by others , and therefore I will have the article <unk> . ” At the words _ I will _ , Beauchamp <unk> raised his eyes to Albert ’ s countenance , and then as gradually <unk> them , he remained thoughtful for a few moments .
“ You will <unk> this <unk> , will you not , Beauchamp ? ” said Albert with increased though stifled anger .
“ Yes , ” replied Beauchamp .
“ <unk> ? ” said Albert .
“ When I am convinced that the statement is false . ” “ What ? ” “ The thing is worth looking into , and I will take pains to <unk> the matter thoroughly . ” “ But what is there to <unk> , sir ? ” said Albert , <unk> beyond measure at Beauchamp ’ s last remark .
“ If you do not believe that it is my father , say so immediately ; and if , on the contrary , you believe it to be him , state your reasons for doing so . ” Beauchamp looked at Albert with the smile which was so peculiar to him , and which in its numerous <unk> served to express every varied emotion of his mind .
“ Sir , ” replied he , “ if you came to me with the idea of <unk> satisfaction , you should have gone at once to the point , and not have entertained me with the idle conversation to which I have been <unk> listening for the last half hour .
Am I to put this construction on your visit ? ” “ Yes , if you will not consent to <unk> that infamous <unk> . ” “ Wait a moment — no <unk> , if you please , M. Fernand <unk> , <unk> de Morcerf ; I never allow them from my enemies , and therefore shall not put up with them from my friends .
You insist on my <unk> the article relating to General Fernand , an article with which , I assure you on my word of honor , I had nothing whatever to do ? ” “ Yes , I insist on it , ” said Albert , whose mind was beginning to get bewildered with the excitement of his feelings .
“ And if I refuse to <unk> , you wish to fight , do you ? ” said Beauchamp in a calm tone .
“ Yes , ” replied Albert , raising his voice .
“ Well , ” said Beauchamp , “ here is my answer , my dear sir .
The article was not <unk> by me — I was not even aware of it ; but you have , by the step you have taken , called my attention to the paragraph in question , and it will remain until it shall be either <unk> or confirmed by someone who has a right to do so . ” “ Sir , ” said Albert , rising , “ I will do myself the honor of sending my seconds to you , and you will be kind enough to arrange with them the place of meeting and the weapons . ” “ Certainly , my dear sir . ” “ And this evening , if you please , or tomorrow at the <unk> , we will meet . ” “ No , no , I will be on the ground at the proper time ; but in my opinion ( and I have a right to <unk> the <unk> , as it is I who have received the <unk> ) — in my opinion the time ought not to be yet .
I know you to be well <unk> in the <unk> of the sword , while I am only <unk> so ; I know , too , that you are a good <unk> — there we are about equal .
I know that a duel between us two would be a serious affair , because you are brave , and I am brave also .
I do not therefore wish either to kill you , or to be killed myself without a cause .
Now , I am going to put a question to you , and one very much to the purpose too .
Do you insist on this <unk> so far as to kill me if I do not make it , although I have repeated more than once , and <unk> on my honor , that I was ignorant of the thing with which you charge me , and although I still declare that it is impossible for anyone but you to recognize the Count of Morcerf under the name of Fernand ? ” “ I <unk> my original resolution . ” “ Very well , my dear sir ; then I consent to cut <unk> with you .
But I require three weeks ’ preparation ; at the end of that time I shall come and say to you , ‘ The <unk> is false , and I <unk> it , ’ or ‘ The <unk> is true , ’ when I shall immediately draw the sword from its <unk> , or the pistols from the case , <unk> you please . ” “ Three weeks ! ” cried Albert ; “ they will pass as slowly as three centuries when I am all the time suffering <unk> . ” “ Had you continued to remain on <unk> terms with me , I should have said , ‘ <unk> , my friend ; ’ but you have constituted yourself my enemy , therefore I say , ‘ What does that signify to me , sir ? ’ ” “ Well , let it be three weeks then , ” said Morcerf ; “ but remember , at the expiration of that time no delay or <unk> will <unk> you in — — ” “ M.
Albert de Morcerf , ” said Beauchamp , rising in his turn , “ I cannot throw you out of window for three weeks — that is to say , for <unk> days to come — nor have you any right to <unk> my <unk> open till that time has elapsed .
<unk> is the <unk> of August ; the <unk> of September will , therefore , be the conclusion of the <unk> agreed on , and till that time arrives — and it is the advice of a gentleman which I am about to give you — till then we will refrain from <unk> and <unk> like two dogs <unk> within sight of each other . ” When he had concluded his speech , Beauchamp bowed coldly to Albert , turned his back upon him , and went to the <unk> .
Albert <unk> his anger on a pile of newspapers , which he sent flying all over the office by <unk> them violently with his stick ; after which <unk> he departed — not , however , without walking several times to the door of the <unk> , as if he had half a mind to enter .
<unk> While Albert was <unk> the front of his carriage in the same manner that he had the newspapers which were the innocent agents of his <unk> , as he was crossing the barrier he perceived Morrel , who was walking with a quick step and a bright eye .
He was passing the <unk> <unk> , and appeared to have come from the direction of the <unk> <unk> , and to be going towards the Madeleine .
“ Ah , ” said Morcerf , “ there goes a happy man ! ” And it so happened Albert was not mistaken in his opinion .
Chapter <unk> .
The <unk> Morrel was , in fact , very happy .
M. Noirtier had just sent for him , and he was in such haste to know the reason of his doing so that he had not stopped to take a cab , placing infinitely more <unk> on his own two legs than on the four legs of a <unk> .
He had therefore set off at a furious rate from the Rue <unk> , and was <unk> with rapid <unk> in the direction of the Faubourg <unk> .
Morrel advanced with a firm , <unk> tread , and poor Barrois followed him as he best might .
Morrel was only <unk> , Barrois was sixty years of age ; Morrel was deeply in love , and Barrois was dying with heat and exertion .
These two men , thus opposed in age and interests , resembled two parts of a <unk> , presenting the <unk> of separation , yet nevertheless <unk> their point of union .
This point of union was Noirtier , and it was he who had just sent for Morrel , with the request that the latter would lose no time in coming to him — a command which Morrel obeyed to the letter , to the great <unk> of Barrois .
On arriving at the house , Morrel was not even out of breath , for love <unk> wings to our desires ; but Barrois , who had long forgotten what it was to love , was <unk> fatigued by the <unk> he had been <unk> to use .
The old servant introduced Morrel by a private entrance , closed the door of the study , and soon the <unk> of a dress announced the arrival of Valentine .
She looked <unk> beautiful in her deep mourning dress , and Morrel experienced such intense delight in gazing upon her that he felt as if he could almost have <unk> with the conversation of her grandfather .
But the <unk> of the old man was heard rolling along the floor , and he soon made his appearance in the room .
Noirtier acknowledged by a look of extreme kindness and <unk> the thanks which Morrel <unk> on him for his <unk> <unk> on <unk> of Valentine and himself — an <unk> which had saved them from despair .
Morrel then cast on the invalid an <unk> look as to the new favor which he <unk> to bestow on him .
Valentine was sitting at a little distance from them , <unk> awaiting the moment when she should be obliged to speak .
Noirtier fixed his eyes on her .
“ Am I to say what you told me ? ” asked Valentine .
Noirtier made a sign that she was to do so .
“ Monsieur Morrel , ” said Valentine to the young man , who was regarding her with the most intense interest , “ my grandfather , M. Noirtier , had a thousand things to say , which he told me three days ago ; and now , he has sent for you , that I may repeat them to you .
I will repeat them , then ; and since he has chosen me as his <unk> , I will be faithful to the trust , and will not alter a word of his intentions . ” “ Oh , I am listening with the greatest impatience , ” replied the young man ; “ speak , I beg of you . ” Valentine cast down her eyes ; this was a good <unk> for Morrel , for he knew that nothing but happiness could have the power of thus <unk> Valentine .
“ My grandfather <unk> leaving this house , ” said she , “ and Barrois is looking out for suitable apartments for him in another . ” “ But you , Mademoiselle de Villefort , — you , who are necessary to M. Noirtier ’ s happiness — — ” “ I ? ” interrupted Valentine ; “ I shall not leave my grandfather , — that is an understood thing between us .
My apartment will be close to his .
Now , M. de Villefort must either give his consent to this plan or his refusal ; in the first case , I shall leave directly , and in the second , I shall wait till I am of age , which will be in about ten months .
Then I shall be free , I shall have an independent fortune , and ” — “ And what ? ” demanded Morrel .
“ And with my grandfather ’ s consent I shall fulfil the promise which I have made you . ” Valentine pronounced these last few words in such a low tone , that nothing but Morrel ’ s intense interest in what she was saying could have enabled him to hear them .
“ Have I not explained your wishes , grandpapa ? ” said Valentine , addressing Noirtier .
“ Yes , ” looked the old man .
“ Once under my grandfather ’ s roof , M. Morrel can visit me in the presence of my good and worthy protector , if we still feel that the union we contemplated will be likely to <unk> our future comfort and happiness ; in that case I shall expect M. Morrel to come and claim me at my own hands .
But , alas , I have heard it said that hearts <unk> by <unk> to their desire grew cold in time of security ; I trust we shall never find it so in our experience ! ” “ Oh , ” cried Morrel , almost tempted to throw himself on his knees before Noirtier and Valentine , and to adore them as two superior beings , “ what have I ever done in my life to merit such <unk> happiness ? ” “ <unk> that time , ” continued the young girl in a calm and <unk> tone of voice , “ we will <unk> to circumstances , and be guided by the wishes of our friends , so long as those wishes do not <unk> finally to separate us ; in a word , and I repeat it , because it <unk> all I wish to convey , — we will wait . ” “ And I swear to make all the <unk> which this word <unk> , sir , ” said Morrel , “ not only with resignation , but with cheerfulness . ” “ <unk> , ” continued Valentine , looking <unk> at Maximilian , “ no more <unk> actions — no more <unk> projects ; for you surely would not wish to <unk> one who from this day <unk> herself as destined , <unk> and happily , to bear your name ? ” Morrel looked obedience to her <unk> .
Noirtier regarded the lovers with a look of ineffable tenderness , while Barrois , who had remained in the room in the character of a man <unk> to know everything that passed , smiled on the youthful couple as he wiped the perspiration from his <unk> forehead .
“ How hot you look , my good Barrois , ” said Valentine .
“ Ah , I have been running very fast , mademoiselle , but I must do M. Morrel the justice to say that he ran still <unk> . ” Noirtier directed their attention to a waiter , on which was placed a <unk> containing <unk> and a glass .
The <unk> was nearly full , with the exception of a little , which had been already drunk by M. Noirtier .
“ Come , Barrois , ” said the young girl , “ take some of this <unk> ; I see you are <unk> a good draught of it . ” “ The fact is , mademoiselle , ” said Barrois , “ I am dying with thirst , and since you are so kind as to offer it me , I cannot say I should at all object to drinking your health in a glass of it . ” “ Take some , then , and come back immediately . ” Barrois took away the waiter , and hardly was he outside the door , which in his haste he forgot to shut , than they saw him throw back his head and empty to the very <unk> the glass which Valentine had filled .
Valentine and Morrel were <unk> their <unk> in the presence of Noirtier when a ring was heard at the <unk> .
It was the signal of a visit .
Valentine looked at her watch .
“ It is past noon , ” said she , “ and today is Saturday ; I dare say it is the doctor , grandpapa . ” Noirtier looked his conviction that she was right in her <unk> .
“ He will come in here , and M. Morrel had better go , — do you not think so , grandpapa ? ” “ Yes , ” signed the old man .
“ Barrois , ” cried Valentine , “ Barrois ! ” “ I am coming , mademoiselle , ” replied he .
“ Barrois will open the door for you , ” said Valentine , addressing Morrel .
“ And now remember one thing , Monsieur <unk> , that my grandfather <unk> you not to take any <unk> or <unk> step which would be likely to <unk> our happiness . ” <unk> “ I promised him to wait , ” replied Morrel ; “ and I will wait . ” At this moment Barrois entered .
“ Who rang ? ” asked Valentine .
“ <unk> d ’ Avrigny , ” said Barrois , <unk> as if he would fall .
“ What is the matter , Barrois ? ” said Valentine .
The old man did not answer , but looked at his master with wild staring eyes , while with his <unk> hand he grasped a piece of furniture to <unk> him to stand upright .
“ He is going to fall ! ” cried Morrel .
The <unk> which had attacked Barrois gradually increased , the features of the face became quite altered , and the <unk> movement of the <unk> appeared to indicate the approach of a most serious nervous disorder .
Noirtier , seeing Barrois in this <unk> condition , showed by his looks all the various emotions of sorrow and sympathy which can <unk> the heart of man .
Barrois made some steps towards his master .
“ Ah , sir , ” said he , “ tell me what is the matter with me .
I am suffering — I cannot see .
A thousand <unk> <unk> are piercing my brain .
Ah , don ’ t touch me , pray don ’ t . ” By this time his haggard eyes had the appearance of being ready to start from their <unk> ; his head fell back , and the lower <unk> of the body began to <unk> .
Valentine uttered a cry of horror ; Morrel took her in his arms , as if to defend her from some unknown danger .
“ M.
d ’ Avrigny , M. d ’ Avrigny , ” cried she , in a stifled voice .
“ <unk> , help ! ” Barrois turned round and with a great effort <unk> a few steps , then fell at the feet of Noirtier , and resting his hand on the knee of the invalid , exclaimed : “ My master , my good master ! ” At this moment M. de Villefort , attracted by the noise , appeared on the threshold .
Morrel <unk> his hold of Valentine , and retreating to a distant corner of the room remained half hidden behind a curtain .
<unk> as if he had been gazing on a <unk> , he fixed his terrified eye on the <unk> <unk> .
Noirtier , burning with impatience and terror , was in despair at his utter <unk> to help his old domestic , whom he regarded more in the light of a friend than a servant .
One might by the fearful <unk> of the veins of his forehead and the <unk> of the <unk> round the eye , trace the terrible conflict which was going on between the living energetic mind and the <unk> and helpless body .
Barrois , his features <unk> , his eyes <unk> with blood , and his head thrown back , was lying at full length , beating the floor with his hands , while his legs had become so stiff , that they looked as if they would break rather than bend .
A slight appearance of <unk> was visible around the mouth , and he breathed <unk> , and with extreme difficulty .
Villefort seemed stupefied with astonishment , and remained gazing intently on the scene before him without uttering a word .
He had not seen Morrel .
After a moment of <unk> contemplation , during which his face became pale and his hair seemed to stand on end , he sprang towards the door , crying out : “ <unk> , doctor !
come instantly , pray come ! ” “ Madame , madame ! ” cried Valentine , calling her <unk> , and running upstairs to meet her ; “ come quick , quick ! — and bring your bottle of <unk> with you . ” “ What is the matter ? ” said Madame de Villefort in a harsh and <unk> tone .
“ Oh !
come !
come ! ” “ But where is the doctor ? ” exclaimed Villefort ; “ where is he ? ” Madame de Villefort now <unk> descended the staircase .
In one hand she held her handkerchief , with which she appeared to be <unk> her face , and in the other a bottle of English <unk> .
Her first look on entering the room was at Noirtier , whose face , independent of the emotion which such a scene could not fail of <unk> , <unk> him to be in possession of his usual health ; her second glance was at the dying man .
She turned pale , and her eye passed quickly from the servant and rested on the master .
“ In the name of heaven , madame , ” said Villefort , “ where is the doctor ?
He was with you just now .
You see this is a fit of <unk> , and he might be saved if he could but be <unk> ! ” “ Has he eaten anything lately ? ” asked Madame de Villefort , <unk> her husband ’ s question .
“ Madame , ” replied Valentine , “ he has not even <unk> .
He has been running very fast on an <unk> with which my grandfather charged him , and when he returned , took nothing but a glass of <unk> . ” “ Ah , ” said Madame de Villefort , “ why did he not take wine ?
<unk> was a very bad thing for him . ” “ <unk> ’ s bottle of <unk> was standing just by his side ; poor Barrois was very <unk> , and was <unk> to drink anything he could find . ” Madame de Villefort started .
Noirtier looked at her with a glance of the most profound <unk> .
“ He has such a short neck , ” said she .
“ Madame , ” said Villefort , “ I ask where is M. d ’ Avrigny ?
In God ’ s name answer me ! ” “ He is with Edward , who is not quite well , ” replied Madame de Villefort , no longer being able to avoid answering .
Villefort rushed upstairs to fetch him .
“ Take this , ” said Madame de Villefort , giving her <unk> to Valentine .
“ They will , no doubt , <unk> him ; therefore I will retire , for I cannot endure the sight of blood ; ” and she followed her husband upstairs .
Morrel now emerged from his <unk> , where he had remained quite <unk> , so great had been the general confusion .
“ Go away as quick as you can , Maximilian , ” said Valentine , “ and stay till I send for you .
Go . ” Morrel looked towards Noirtier for permission to retire .
The old man , who had preserved all his usual coolness , made a sign to him to do so .
The young man pressed Valentine ’ s hand to his lips , and then left the house by a back staircase .
At the same moment that he quitted the room , Villefort and the doctor entered by an opposite door .
Barrois was now showing signs of returning consciousness .
The crisis seemed past , a low <unk> was heard , and he raised himself on one knee .
D ’ Avrigny and Villefort laid him on a <unk> .
“ What do you <unk> , doctor ? ” demanded Villefort .
“ Give me some water and <unk> .
You have some in the house , have you not ? ” “ Yes . ” “ <unk> for some <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> . ” Villefort immediately <unk> a messenger .
“ And now let everyone retire . ” “ <unk> I go too ? ” asked Valentine <unk> .
“ Yes , mademoiselle , you especially , ” replied the doctor abruptly .
Valentine looked at M. d ’ Avrigny with astonishment , kissed her grandfather on the forehead , and left the room .
The doctor closed the door after her with a gloomy air .
“ Look , look , doctor , ” said Villefort , “ he is quite coming round again ; I really do not think , after all , it is anything of consequence . ” M. d ’ Avrigny answered by a melancholy smile .
“ How do you feel , Barrois ? ” asked he .
“ A little better , sir . ” “ Will you drink some of this <unk> and water ? ” “ I will try ; but don ’ t touch me . ” “ Why not ? ” “ Because I feel that if you were only to touch me with the <unk> of your finger the fit would return . ” “ <unk> . ” Barrois took the glass , and , raising it to his purple lips , took about half of the <unk> offered him .
“ Where do you suffer ? ” asked the doctor .
“ <unk> .
I feel <unk> over my whole body . ” “ Do you find any dazzling sensation before the eyes ? ” “ Yes . ” “ Any noise in the ears ? ” “ <unk> . ” <unk> “ When did you first feel that ? ” “ Just now . ” “ Suddenly ? ” “ Yes , like a <unk> of thunder . ” “ Did you feel nothing of it yesterday or the day before ? ” “ Nothing . ” “ No <unk> ? ” “ None . ” “ What have you eaten today ? ” “ I have eaten nothing ; I only drank a glass of my master ’ s <unk> — that ’ s all . ” And Barrois turned towards Noirtier , who , <unk> fixed in his armchair , was <unk> this terrible scene without allowing a word or a movement to escape him .
“ Where is this <unk> ? ” asked the doctor eagerly .
“ <unk> in the <unk> . ” “ <unk> downstairs ? ” “ In the kitchen . ” “ Shall I go and fetch it , doctor ? ” inquired Villefort .
“ No , stay here and try to make Barrois drink the rest of this glass of <unk> and water .
I will go myself and fetch the <unk> . ” D ’ Avrigny bounded towards the door , flew down the back staircase , and almost knocked down Madame de Villefort , in his haste , who was herself going down to the kitchen .
She cried out , but d ’ Avrigny paid no attention to her ; possessed with but one idea , he cleared the last four steps with a bound , and rushed into the kitchen , where he saw the <unk> about three parts empty still standing on the waiter , where it had been left .
He darted upon it as an eagle would seize upon its prey .
<unk> with loss of breath , he returned to the room he had just left .
Madame de Villefort was slowly <unk> the steps which led to her room .
“ Is this the <unk> you spoke of ? ” asked d ’ Avrigny .
“ Yes , doctor . ” “ Is this the same <unk> of which you <unk> ? ” “ I believe so . ” “ What did it taste like ? ” “ It had a bitter taste . ” The doctor poured some drops of the <unk> into the <unk> of his hand , put his lips to it , and after having <unk> his mouth as a man does when he is <unk> wine , he <unk> the <unk> into the fireplace .
“ It is no doubt the same , ” said he .
“ Did you drink some too , M. Noirtier ? ” “ Yes . ” “ And did you also discover a bitter taste ? ” “ Yes . ” “ Oh , doctor , ” cried Barrois , “ the fit is coming on again .
Oh , do something for me . ” The doctor flew to his patient .
“ That <unk> , Villefort — see if it is coming . ” Villefort sprang into the passage , <unk> , “ The <unk> !
the <unk> ! — is it come yet ? ” No one answered .
The most profound terror reigned throughout the house .
“ If I had anything by means of which I could <unk> the <unk> , ” said d ’ Avrigny , looking around him , “ perhaps I might prevent <unk> .
But there is nothing which would do ! — nothing ! ” <unk> “ Oh , sir , ” cried Barrois , “ are you going to let me die without help ?
Oh , I am dying !
Oh , save me ! ” “ A pen , a pen ! ” said the doctor .
There was one lying on the table ; he endeavored to introduce it into the mouth of the patient , who , in the midst of his <unk> , was making vain attempts to <unk> ; but the <unk> were so clenched that the pen could not pass them .
This second attack was much more violent than the first , and he had slipped from the <unk> to the ground , where he was <unk> in agony .
The doctor left him in this <unk> , knowing that he could do nothing to <unk> it , and , going up to Noirtier , said abruptly : “ How do you find yourself ? — well ? ” “ Yes . ” “ Have you any weight on the chest ; or does your stomach feel light and comfortable — <unk> ? ” “ Yes . ” “ Then you feel pretty much as you generally do after you have had the <unk> which I am accustomed to give you every Sunday ? ” “ Yes . ” “ Did Barrois make your <unk> ? ” “ Yes . ” “ Was it you who asked him to drink some of it ? ” “ No . ” “ Was it M. de Villefort ? ” “ No . ” “ Madame ? ” “ No . ” “ It was your <unk> , then , was it not ? ” “ Yes . ” A groan from Barrois , accompanied by a <unk> which seemed to <unk> the very <unk> , attracted the attention of M. d ’ Avrigny ; he left M. Noirtier , and returned to the sick man .
“ Barrois , ” said the doctor , “ can you speak ? ” Barrois muttered a few <unk> words .
“ <unk> and make an effort to do so , my good man . ” said d ’ Avrigny .
Barrois <unk> his <unk> eyes .
“ Who made the <unk> ? ” “ I did . ” “ Did you bring it to your master directly it was made ? ” “ No . ” “ You left it somewhere , then , in the meantime ? ” “ Yes ; I left it in the <unk> , because I was called away . ” “ Who brought it into this room , then ? ” “ Mademoiselle Valentine . ” D ’ Avrigny struck his forehead with his hand .
“ <unk> heaven , ” exclaimed he .
“ <unk> , doctor ! ” cried Barrois , who felt another fit coming .
“ Will they never bring that <unk> ? ” asked the doctor .
“ Here is a glass with one already prepared , ” said Villefort , entering the room .
“ Who prepared it ? ” “ The <unk> who came here with me . ” <unk> “ <unk> it , ” said the doctor to Barrois .
“ Impossible , doctor ; it is too late ; my throat is closing up .
I am <unk> !
Oh , my heart !
Ah , my head ! — Oh , what agony ! — Shall I suffer like this long ? ” “ No , no , friend , ” replied the doctor , “ you will soon cease to suffer . ” “ Ah , I understand you , ” said the unhappy man .
“ My God , have mercy upon me ! ” and , uttering a fearful cry , Barrois fell back as if he had been struck by lightning .
D ’ Avrigny put his hand to his heart , and placed a glass before his lips .
“ Well ? ” said Villefort .
“ Go to the kitchen and get me some <unk> of <unk> . ” Villefort went immediately .
“ Do not be alarmed , M. Noirtier , ” said d ’ Avrigny ; “ I am going to take my patient into the next room to <unk> him ; this sort of attack is very frightful to witness . ” And taking Barrois under the arms , he dragged him into an adjoining room ; but almost immediately he returned to fetch the <unk> .
Noirtier closed his right eye .
“ You want Valentine , do you not ?
I will tell them to send her to you . ” Villefort returned , and d ’ Avrigny met him in the passage .
“ Well , how is he now ? ” asked he .
“ Come in here , ” said d ’ Avrigny , and he took him into the chamber where the sick man lay .
“ Is he still in a fit ? ” said the procureur .
“ He is dead . ” Villefort drew back a few steps , and , <unk> his hands , exclaimed , with real amazement and sympathy , “ <unk> ? — and so soon too ! ” “ Yes , it is very soon , ” said the doctor , looking at the corpse before him ; “ but that ought not to <unk> you ; Monsieur and Madame de Saint-Méran died as soon .
People die very suddenly in your house , M. de Villefort . ” “ What ? ” cried the magistrate , with an accent of horror and <unk> , “ are you still <unk> on that terrible idea ? ” “ Still , sir ; and I shall always do so , ” replied d ’ Avrigny , “ for it has never for one instant ceased to retain possession of my mind ; and that you may be quite sure I am not mistaken this time , listen well to what I am going to say , M. de Villefort . ” The magistrate trembled convulsively .
“ There is a poison which <unk> life almost without leaving any <unk> traces .
I know it well ; I have studied it in all its forms and in the effects which it produces .
I recognized the presence of this poison in the case of poor Barrois as well as in that of Madame de Saint-Méran .
There is a way of <unk> its presence .
It <unk> the blue color of <unk> <unk> by an <unk> , and it turns <unk> of <unk> green .
We have no <unk> , but , see , here they come with the <unk> of <unk> . ” The doctor was right ; steps were heard in the passage .
M. d ’ Avrigny opened the door , and took from the hands of the <unk> a cup which contained two or three <unk> of the <unk> , he then carefully closed the door .
“ Look , ” said he to the procureur , whose heart beat so loudly that it might almost be heard , “ here is in this cup some <unk> of <unk> , and this <unk> contains the <unk> of the <unk> of which M. Noirtier and Barrois <unk> .
If the <unk> be pure and <unk> , the <unk> will retain its color ; if , on the contrary , the <unk> be <unk> with poison , the <unk> will become green .
Look closely ! ” The doctor then slowly poured some drops of the <unk> from the <unk> into the cup , and in an instant a light <unk> <unk> began to form at the bottom of the cup ; this <unk> first took a blue shade , then from the color of <unk> it passed to that of <unk> , and from <unk> to <unk> .
<unk> at this last hue , it changed no more .
The result of the <unk> left no doubt whatever on the mind .
“ The unfortunate Barrois has been <unk> , ” said d ’ Avrigny , “ and I will <unk> this <unk> before God and man . ” Villefort said nothing , but he clasped his hands , opened his haggard eyes , and , overcome with his emotion , sank into a chair .
Chapter <unk> .
The <unk> M. d ’ Avrigny soon restored the magistrate to consciousness , who had looked like a second corpse in that chamber of death .
“ Oh , death is in my house ! ” cried Villefort .
“ Say , rather , crime ! ” replied the doctor .
“ M.
d ’ Avrigny , ” cried Villefort , “ I cannot tell you all I feel at this moment , — terror , grief , madness . ” “ Yes , ” said M. d ’ Avrigny , with an <unk> calmness , “ but I think it is now time to act .
I think it is time to stop this <unk> of <unk> .
I can no longer bear to be in possession of these secrets without the hope of seeing the <unk> and society generally <unk> . ” Villefort cast a gloomy look around him .
“ In my house , ” murmured he , “ in my house ! ” “ Come , magistrate , ” said M. d ’ Avrigny , “ show yourself a man ; as an <unk> of the law , do honor to your profession by <unk> your selfish interests to it . ” “ You make me shudder , doctor .
Do you talk of a sacrifice ? ” “ I do . ” “ Do you then suspect anyone ? ” “ I suspect no one ; death <unk> at your door — it enters — it goes , not <unk> , but <unk> , from room to room .
Well , I follow its course , I track its passage ; I <unk> the wisdom of the <unk> , and feel my way , for my friendship for your family and my respect for you are as a <unk> <unk> over my eyes ; well — — ” “ Oh , speak , speak , doctor ; I shall have courage . ” “ Well , sir , you have in your establishment , or in your family , perhaps , one of the frightful <unk> of which each century produces only one .
<unk> and <unk> , living at the same time , were an exception , and proved the determination of Providence to effect the entire ruin of the Roman <unk> , <unk> by so many crimes .
<unk> and <unk> were the results of the painful struggle of civilization in its <unk> , when man was <unk> to <unk> mind , were it even by an <unk> from the <unk> of darkness .
All these women had been , or were , beautiful .
The same flower of innocence had <unk> , or was still <unk> , on their brow , that is seen on the brow of the <unk> in your house . ” <unk> Villefort <unk> , clasped his hands , and looked at the doctor with a <unk> air .
But the latter went on without pity : “ ‘ <unk> whom the crime will profit , ’ says an <unk> of <unk> . ” “ <unk> , ” cried Villefort , “ alas , doctor , how often has man ’ s justice been deceived by those fatal words .
I know not why , but I feel that this crime — — ” “ You acknowledge , then , the existence of the crime ? ” “ Yes , I see too plainly that it does exist .
But it seems that it is intended to affect me <unk> .
I fear an attack myself , after all these <unk> . ” “ Oh , man ! ” murmured d ’ Avrigny , “ the most selfish of all animals , the most personal of all creatures , who <unk> the earth turns , the sun <unk> , and death strikes for him alone , — an <unk> <unk> God from the top of a <unk> of grass !
And have those who have lost their lives lost nothing ? — M.
de Saint-Méran , Madame de Saint-Méran , M. Noirtier — — ” “ How ?
M. Noirtier ? ” “ Yes ; think you it was the poor servant ’ s life was <unk> ?
No , no ; like <unk> ’ s <unk> , he died for another .
It was Noirtier the <unk> was intended for — it is Noirtier , <unk> speaking , who drank it .
The other drank it only by accident , and , although Barrois is dead , it was Noirtier whose death was wished for . ” “ But why did it not kill my father ? ” “ I told you one evening in the garden after Madame de Saint-Méran ’ s death — because his system is accustomed to that very poison , and the <unk> was trifling to him , which would be fatal to another ; because no one knows , not even the assassin , that , for the last twelve months , I have given M. Noirtier <unk> for his <unk> affection , while the assassin is not ignorant , for he has proved that <unk> is a violent poison . ” “ Oh , have pity — have pity ! ” murmured Villefort , <unk> his hands .
“ <unk> the <unk> ’ s steps ; he first <unk> M. de Saint-Méran — — ” “ Oh , doctor ! ” “ I would swear to it ; what I heard of his symptoms <unk> too well with what I have seen in the other cases . ” Villefort ceased to <unk> ; he only <unk> .
“ He first <unk> M. de Saint-Méran , ” repeated the doctor , “ then Madame de Saint-Méran , — a double fortune to <unk> . ” Villefort wiped the perspiration from his forehead .
“ Listen attentively . ” “ Alas , ” stammered Villefort , “ I do not lose a single word . ” “ M.
Noirtier , ” resumed M. d ’ Avrigny in the same <unk> tone , — “ M.
Noirtier had once made a will against you — against your family — in favor of the poor , in fact ; M. Noirtier is spared , because nothing is expected from him .
But he has no sooner destroyed his first will and made a second , than , for fear he should make a third , he is struck down .
The will was made the day before yesterday , I believe ; you see there has been no time lost . ” “ Oh , mercy , M. d ’ Avrigny ! ” “ No mercy , sir !
The physician has a sacred mission on earth ; and to fulfil it he begins at the source of life , and goes down to the mysterious darkness of the tomb .
When crime has been committed , and God , doubtless in anger , turns away his face , it is for the physician to bring the <unk> to justice . ” <unk> “ Have mercy on my child , sir , ” murmured Villefort .
“ You see it is yourself who have first named her — you , her father . ” “ Have pity on Valentine !
Listen , it is impossible .
I would as willingly <unk> myself !
Valentine , whose heart is pure as a diamond or a <unk> ! ” “ No pity , procureur ; the crime is <unk> .
Mademoiselle herself <unk> all the <unk> which were sent to M. de Saint-Méran ; and M. de Saint-Méran is dead .
Mademoiselle de Villefort prepared all the <unk> <unk> which Madame de Saint-Méran took , and Madame de Saint-Méran is dead .
Mademoiselle de Villefort took from the hands of Barrois , who was sent out , the <unk> which M. Noirtier had every morning , and he has escaped by a miracle .
Mademoiselle de Villefort is the <unk> — she is the <unk> !
To you , as the king ’ s attorney , I <unk> Mademoiselle de Villefort , do your duty . ” “ <unk> , I resist no longer — I can no longer defend myself — I believe you ; but , for pity ’ s sake , spare my life , my honor ! ” “ M.
de Villefort , ” replied the doctor , with increased <unk> , “ there are occasions when I <unk> with all foolish human <unk> .
If your daughter had committed only one crime , and I saw her <unk> another , I would say ‘ <unk> her , <unk> her , let her pass the <unk> of her life in a convent , weeping and praying . ’ If she had committed two crimes , I would say , ‘ Here , M. de Villefort , is a poison that the prisoner is not acquainted with , — one that has no known <unk> , quick as thought , rapid as lightning , mortal as the <unk> ; give her that poison , <unk> her soul to God , and save your honor and your life , for it is yours she <unk> at ; and I can picture her approaching your pillow with her <unk> smiles and her sweet <unk> .
<unk> to you , M. de Villefort , if you do not strike first ! ’ This is what I would say had she only killed two persons but she has seen three <unk> , — has contemplated three murdered persons , — has knelt by three corpses !
To the scaffold with the <unk> — to the scaffold !
Do you talk of your honor ?
Do what I tell you , and <unk> <unk> you ! ” Villefort fell on his knees .
“ Listen , ” said he ; “ I have not the strength of mind you have , or rather that which you would not have , if instead of my daughter Valentine your daughter Madeleine were concerned . ” The doctor turned pale .
“ <unk> , every son of woman is born to suffer and to die ; I am content to suffer and to await death . ” “ <unk> , ” said M. d ’ Avrigny , “ it may come slowly ; you will see it approach after having struck your father , your wife , perhaps your son . ” Villefort , <unk> , pressed the doctor ’ s arm .
<unk> “ Listen , ” cried he ; “ pity me — help me !
No , my daughter is not guilty .
If you drag us both before a <unk> I will still say , ‘ No , my daughter is not guilty ; — there is no crime in my house .
I will not acknowledge a crime in my house ; for when crime enters a dwelling , it is like death — it does not come alone . ’ Listen .
What does it signify to you if I am murdered ?
Are you my friend ?
Are you a man ?
Have you a heart ?
No , you are a physician !
Well , I tell you I will not drag my daughter before a <unk> , and give her up to the executioner !
The bare idea would kill me — would drive me like a madman to <unk> my heart out with my <unk> !
And if you were mistaken , doctor — if it were not my daughter — if I should come one day , pale as a spectre , and say to you , ‘ <unk> , you have killed my child ! ’ — hold — if that should happen , although I am a Christian , M. d ’ Avrigny , I should kill myself . ” “ Well , ” said the doctor , after a moment ’ s silence , “ I will wait . ” Villefort looked at him as if he had doubted his words .
“ Only , ” continued M. d ’ Avrigny , with a slow and solemn tone , “ if anyone falls ill in your house , if you feel yourself attacked , do not send for me , for I will come no more .
I will consent to share this dreadful secret with you , but I will not allow shame and remorse to grow and increase in my conscience , as crime and misery will in your house . ” “ Then you abandon me , doctor ? ” “ Yes , for I can follow you no farther , and I only stop at the foot of the scaffold .
Some further discovery will be made , which will bring this dreadful tragedy to a close .
Adieu . ” “ I entreat you , doctor ! ” “ All the horrors that disturb my thoughts make your house <unk> and fatal .
Adieu , sir . ” “ One word — one single word more , doctor !
You go , leaving me in all the horror of my situation , after increasing it by what you have revealed to me .
But what will be reported of the sudden death of the poor old servant ? ” “ True , ” said M. d ’ Avrigny ; “ we will return . ” The doctor went out first , followed by M. de Villefort .
The terrified servants were on the stairs and in the passage where the doctor would pass .
“ Sir , ” said d ’ Avrigny to Villefort , so loud that all might hear , “ poor Barrois has led too <unk> a life of late ; accustomed formerly to ride on horseback , or in the carriage , to the four corners of Europe , the <unk> walk around that armchair has killed him — his blood has <unk> .
He was <unk> , had a short , thick neck ; he was attacked with <unk> , and I was called in too late .
By the way , ” added he in a low tone , “ take care to throw away that cup of <unk> of <unk> in the ashes . ” The doctor , without shaking hands with Villefort , without <unk> a word to what he had said , went out , amid the tears and <unk> of the whole household .
The same evening all Villefort ’ s servants , who had assembled in the kitchen , and had a long <unk> , came to tell Madame de Villefort that they wished to leave .
No <unk> , no <unk> of increased <unk> , could induce them to remain ; to every <unk> they replied , “ We must go , for death is in this house . ” They all left , in spite of prayers and <unk> , <unk> their regret at leaving so good a master and mistress , and especially Mademoiselle Valentine , so good , so kind , and so gentle .
Villefort looked at Valentine as they said this .
She was in tears , and , strange as it was , in spite of the emotions he felt at the sight of these tears , he looked also at Madame de Villefort , and it appeared to him as if a slight gloomy smile had passed over her thin lips , like a <unk> seen passing <unk> between two clouds in a stormy sky .
Chapter <unk> .
The <unk> of the <unk> <unk> The evening of the day on which the Count of Morcerf had left Danglars ’ house with feelings of shame and anger at the <unk> of the projected alliance , M. Andrea Cavalcanti , with <unk> hair , <unk> in perfect order , and white gloves which fitted admirably , had entered the courtyard of the banker ’ s house in Rue de la <unk> d ’ <unk> .
He had not been more than ten minutes in the drawing-room before he drew Danglars aside into the <unk> of a <unk> , and , after an ingenious <unk> , related to him all his <unk> and cares since his noble father ’ s departure .
He acknowledged the extreme kindness which had been shown him by the banker ’ s family , in which he had been received as a son , and where , besides , his <unk> affections had found an object on which to centre in Mademoiselle Danglars .
Danglars listened with the most profound attention ; he had expected this declaration for the last two or three days , and when at last it came his eyes <unk> as much as they had lowered on listening to Morcerf .
He would not , however , yield immediately to the young man ’ s request , but made a few <unk> objections .
“ Are you not rather young , M. Andrea , to think of marrying ? ” “ I think not , sir , ” replied M. Cavalcanti ; “ in Italy the nobility generally marry young .
Life is so <unk> , that we ought to secure happiness while it is within our reach . ” “ Well , sir , ” said Danglars , “ in case your <unk> , which do me honor , are accepted by my wife and daughter , by whom shall the <unk> arrangements be settled ?
So important a <unk> should , I think , be conducted by the <unk> fathers of the young people . ” “ Sir , my father is a man of great <unk> and prudence .
<unk> that I might wish to settle in France , he left me at his departure , together with the papers <unk> my identity , a letter <unk> , if he approved of my choice , <unk> livres per <unk> from the day I was married .
So far as I can judge , I suppose this to be a quarter of my father ’ s <unk> . ” “ I , ” said Danglars , “ have always intended giving my daughter <unk> francs as her <unk> ; she is , besides , my sole <unk> . ” “ All would then be easily arranged if the baroness and her daughter are willing .
We should command an <unk> of <unk> livres .
<unk> , also , I should persuade the marquis to give me my capital , which is not likely , but still is possible , we would place these two or three millions in your hands , whose talent might make it realize ten per <unk> . ” “ I never give more than four per <unk> , and generally only three and a half ; but to my <unk> I would give five , and we would share the <unk> . ” “ Very good , <unk> , ” said Cavalcanti , <unk> to his <unk> nature , which would escape sometimes through the <unk> <unk> with which he sought to conceal it .
<unk> himself immediately , he said , “ Excuse me , sir ; hope alone makes me almost mad , — what will not reality do ? ” “ But , ” said Danglars , who , on his part , did not perceive how soon the conversation , which was at first <unk> , was turning to a business <unk> , “ there is , doubtless , a part of your fortune your father could not refuse you ? ” “ Which ? ” asked the young man .
“ That you <unk> from your mother . ” “ <unk> , from my mother , <unk> <unk> . ” “ How much may it amount to ? ” “ Indeed , sir , ” said Andrea , “ I assure you I have never given the subject a thought , but I suppose it must have been at least two millions . ” Danglars felt as much overcome with joy as the <unk> who finds a lost treasure , or as the <unk> <unk> who feels himself on solid ground instead of in the abyss which he expected would <unk> him up .
“ Well , sir , ” said Andrea , bowing to the banker <unk> , “ may I hope ? ” “ You may not only hope , ” said Danglars , “ but consider it a settled thing , if no obstacle <unk> on your part . ” “ I am , indeed , rejoiced , ” said Andrea .
“ But , ” said Danglars <unk> , “ how is it that your patron , M. de Monte Cristo , did not make his proposal for you ? ” Andrea <unk> <unk> .
“ I have just left the count , sir , ” said he ; “ he is , doubtless , a delightful man but <unk> peculiar in his ideas .
He <unk> me highly .
He even told me he had not the slightest doubt that my father would give me the capital instead of the interest of my property .
He has promised to use his influence to obtain it for me ; but he also declared that he never had taken on himself the <unk> of making <unk> for another , and he never would .
I must , however , do him the justice to add that he assured me if ever he had regretted the <unk> he felt to such a step it was on this occasion , because he thought the projected union would be a happy and suitable one .
Besides , if he will do nothing <unk> , he will answer any questions you propose to him .
And now , ” continued he , with one of his most charming smiles , “ having finished talking to the <unk> , I must address myself to the banker . ” “ And what may you have to say to him ? ” said Danglars , laughing in his turn .
“ That the day after tomorrow I shall have to draw upon you for about four thousand francs ; but the count , expecting my <unk> ’ s <unk> could not suffice for the coming month ’ s <unk> , has offered me a <unk> for twenty thousand francs .
It bears his signature , as you see , which is <unk> . ” “ <unk> me a million such as that , ” said Danglars , “ I shall be well pleased , ” putting the <unk> in his pocket .
“ <unk> your own hour for tomorrow , and my <unk> shall call on you with a check for eighty thousand francs . ” “ At ten o ’ clock then , if you please ; I should like it early , as I am going into the country tomorrow . ” “ Very well , at ten o ’ clock ; you are still at the Hôtel des <unk> ? ” “ Yes . ” The following morning , with the banker ’ s usual <unk> , the eighty thousand francs were placed in the young man ’ s hands , as he was on the point of starting , after having left two hundred francs for Caderousse .
He went out chiefly to avoid this dangerous enemy , and returned as late as possible in the evening .
But scarcely had he stepped out of his carriage when the porter met him with a <unk> in his hand .
“ Sir , ” said he , “ that man has been here . ” “ What man ? ” said Andrea <unk> , apparently forgetting him whom he but too well recollected .
“ <unk> to whom your excellency <unk> that little <unk> . ” “ Oh , ” said Andrea , “ my father ’ s old servant .
Well , you gave him the two hundred francs I had left for him ? ” “ Yes , your excellency . ” Andrea had expressed a wish to be thus addressed .
“ But , ” continued the porter , “ he would not take them . ” Andrea turned pale , but as it was dark his pallor was not <unk> .
“ What ?
he would not take them ? ” said he with slight emotion .
<unk> “ No , he wished to speak to your excellency ; I told him you were gone out , and after some <unk> he believed me and gave me this letter , which he had brought with him already sealed . ” “ Give it me , ” said Andrea , and he read by the light of his <unk> : “ ‘ You know where I live ; I expect you tomorrow morning at nine o ’ clock . ’ ” Andrea examined it carefully , to ascertain if the letter had been opened , or if any <unk> eyes had seen its contents ; but it was so carefully folded , that no one could have read it , and the <unk> was perfect .
“ Very well , ” said he .
“ Poor man , he is a worthy creature . ” He left the porter to <unk> on these words , not knowing which most to admire , the master or the servant .
“ Take out the horses quickly , and come up to me , ” said Andrea to his <unk> .
In two seconds the young man had reached his room and burnt Caderousse ’ s letter .
The servant entered just as he had finished .
“ You are about my height , <unk> , ” said he .
“ I have that honor , your excellency . ” “ You had a new <unk> yesterday ? ” “ Yes , sir . ” “ I have an engagement with a pretty little girl for this evening , and do not wish to be known ; lend me your <unk> till tomorrow .
I may sleep , perhaps , at an inn . ” <unk> obeyed .
Five minutes after , Andrea left the hotel , completely <unk> , took a cabriolet , and ordered the driver to take him to the <unk> <unk> , at <unk> .
The next morning he left that inn as he had left the Hôtel des <unk> , without being noticed , walked down the Faubourg Saint-Antoine , along the boulevard to Rue <unk> , and stopping at the door of the third house on the left looked for someone of whom to make inquiry in the porter ’ s absence .
“ For whom are you looking , my fine fellow ? ” asked the <unk> on the opposite side .
“ Monsieur <unk> , if you please , my good woman , ” replied Andrea .
“ A retired baker ? ” asked the <unk> .
“ Exactly . ” “ He lives at the end of the yard , on the left , on the third story . ” <unk> Andrea went as she directed him , and on the third floor he found a <unk> ’ s <unk> , which , by the hasty <unk> of the bell , it was evident he pulled with considerable <unk> .
A moment after Caderousse ’ s face appeared at the grating in the door .
“ Ah !
you are <unk> , ” said he , as he drew back the door .
“ <unk> you and your <unk> ! ” said Andrea , throwing himself into a chair in a manner which <unk> that he would rather have flung it at the head of his host .
“ Come , come , my little fellow , don ’ t be angry .
See , I have thought about you — look at the good breakfast we are going to have ; nothing but what you are fond of . ” Andrea , indeed , <unk> the scent of something <unk> which was not <unk> to him , hungry as he was ; it was that mixture of fat and <unk> peculiar to <unk> <unk> of an inferior order , added to that of dried fish , and above all , the <unk> smell of <unk> and <unk> .
These <unk> escaped from two deep <unk> which were covered and placed on a stove , and from a <unk> <unk> placed in an old iron <unk> .
In an adjoining room Andrea saw also a tolerably clean table prepared for two , two bottles of wine sealed , the one with green , the other with yellow , a supply of brandy in a <unk> , and a measure of fruit in a <unk> , <unk> arranged on an <unk> plate .
“ What do you think of it , my little fellow ? ” said Caderousse .
“ <unk> , that <unk> good !
You know I used to be a good <unk> ; do you recollect how you used to <unk> your fingers ?
You were among the first who <unk> any of my <unk> , and I think you <unk> them tolerably . ” While speaking , Caderousse went on <unk> a fresh supply of <unk> .
“ But , ” said Andrea , <unk> , “ by my faith , if it was only to breakfast with you , that you disturbed me , I wish the devil had taken you ! ” “ My boy , ” said Caderousse <unk> , “ one can talk while eating .
And then , you <unk> being , you are not pleased to see an old friend ?
I am weeping with joy . ” He was truly crying , but it would have been difficult to say whether joy or the <unk> produced the greatest effect on the <unk> <unk> of the old innkeeper of the <unk> .
“ Hold your tongue , <unk> , ” said Andrea ; “ you love me ! ” “ Yes , I do , or may the devil take me .
I know it is a weakness , ” said Caderousse , “ but it <unk> me . ” “ And yet it has not prevented your sending for me to play me some <unk> . ” “ Come , ” said Caderousse , <unk> his large knife on his <unk> , “ if I did not like you , do you think I should endure the wretched life you lead me ?
Think for a moment .
You have your servant ’ s clothes on — you therefore keep a servant ; I have none , and am obliged to prepare my own <unk> .
You <unk> my <unk> because you dine at the table d ’ <unk> of the Hôtel des <unk> , or the Café de Paris .
Well , I too could keep a servant ; I too could have a tilbury ; I too could dine where I like ; but why do I not ?
Because I would not <unk> my little Benedetto .
Come , just acknowledge that I could , <unk> ? ” This address was accompanied by a look which was by no means difficult to understand .
“ Well , ” said Andrea , “ <unk> your love , why do you want me to breakfast with you ? ” “ That I may have the pleasure of seeing you , my little fellow . ” “ What is the use of seeing me after we have made all our arrangements ? ” “ <unk> , dear friend , ” said Caderousse , “ are <unk> ever made without <unk> ?
But you first came to breakfast , did you not ?
Well , sit down , and let us begin with these <unk> , and this fresh <unk> ; which I have put on some <unk> to please you , wicked one .
Ah , yes ; you look at my room , my four straw chairs , my <unk> , three francs each .
But what do you expect ?
This is not the Hôtel des <unk> . ” “ Come , you are growing <unk> , you are no longer happy ; you , who only wish to live like a retired baker . ” Caderousse sighed .
“ Well , what have you to say ?
you have seen your dream realized . ” “ I can still say it is a dream ; a retired baker , my poor Benedetto , is rich — he has an <unk> . ” “ Well , you have an <unk> . ” “ I have ? ” <unk> “ Yes , since I bring you your two hundred francs . ” Caderousse shrugged his shoulders .
“ It is <unk> , ” said he , “ thus to receive money given <unk> , — an <unk> supply which may soon fail .
You see I am obliged to <unk> , in case your prosperity should cease .
Well , my friend , fortune is <unk> , as the <unk> of the regiment said .
I know your prosperity is great , you rascal ; you are to marry the daughter of Danglars . ” “ What ?
of Danglars ? ” “ Yes , to be sure ; must I say Baron Danglars ?
I might as well say Count Benedetto .
He was an old friend of mine and if he had not so bad a memory he ought to invite me to your wedding , seeing he came to mine .
Yes , yes , to mine ; <unk> , he was not so proud then , — he was an <unk> to the good M. Morrel .
I have dined many times with him and the Count of Morcerf , so you see I have some high <unk> and were I to <unk> them a little , we might meet in the same <unk> . ” “ Come , your jealousy <unk> everything to you in the wrong light . ” “ That is all very fine , Benedetto <unk> , but I know what I am saying .
Perhaps I may one day put on my best coat , and presenting myself at the great gate , introduce myself .
Meanwhile let us sit down and eat . ” Caderousse set the example and attacked the breakfast with good appetite , <unk> each <unk> he set before his visitor .
The latter seemed to have resigned himself ; he drew the <unk> , and <unk> <unk> of the fish with the <unk> and fat .
“ Ah , mate , ” said Caderousse , “ you are getting on better terms with your old landlord ! ” “ <unk> , yes , ” replied Andrea , whose hunger prevailed over every other feeling .
“ So you like it , you <unk> ? ” “ So much that I wonder how a man who can <unk> thus can complain of hard living . ” “ Do you see , ” said Caderousse , “ all my happiness is <unk> by one thought ? ” “ What is that ? ” “ That I am <unk> on another , I who have always gained my own <unk> <unk> . ” “ Do not let that disturb you , I have enough for two . ” “ No , truly ; you may believe me if you will ; at the end of every month I am <unk> by remorse . ” “ Good Caderousse ! ” “ So much so , that yesterday I would not take the two hundred francs . ” “ Yes , you wished to speak to me ; but was it indeed remorse , tell me ? ” “ True remorse ; and , besides , an idea had struck me . ” Andrea shuddered ; he always did so at Caderousse ’ s ideas .
“ It is miserable — do you see ? — always to wait till the end of the month . ” “ Oh , ” said Andrea <unk> , determined to watch his companion <unk> , “ does not life pass in waiting ?
Do I , for instance , <unk> better ?
Well , I wait <unk> , do I not ? ” “ Yes ; because instead of expecting two hundred wretched francs , you expect five or six thousand , perhaps ten , perhaps even twelve , for you take care not to let anyone know the utmost .
<unk> there , you always had little presents and <unk> , which you tried to hide from your poor friend Caderousse .
Fortunately he is a cunning fellow , that friend Caderousse . ” “ There you are beginning again to <unk> , to talk again and again of the past !
But what is the use of <unk> me with going all over that again ? ” “ Ah , you are only <unk> , and can forget the past ; I am fifty , and am obliged to recollect it .
But let us return to business . ” “ Yes . ” “ I was going to say , if I were in your place — — ” “ Well . ” “ I would realize — — ” “ How would you realize ? ” “ I would ask for six months ’ in advance , under <unk> of being able to purchase a farm , then with my six months I would <unk> . ” “ Well , well , ” said Andrea , “ that <unk> ’ t a bad idea . ” “ My dear friend , ” said Caderousse , “ eat of my bread , and take my advice ; you will be none the worse off , <unk> or <unk> . ” “ But , ” said Andrea , “ why do you not act on the advice you gave me ?
Why do you not realize a six months ’ , a year ’ s advance even , and retire to <unk> ?
<unk> of living the retired baker , you might live as a <unk> , using his <unk> ; that would be very good . ” “ But how the devil would you have me retire on twelve hundred francs ? ” “ Ah , Caderousse , ” said Andrea , “ how <unk> you are !
Two months ago you were dying with hunger . ” “ The appetite grows by what it <unk> on , ” said Caderousse , <unk> and showing his teeth , like a <unk> laughing or a tiger <unk> .
“ And , ” added he , <unk> off with his large white teeth an enormous <unk> of bread , “ I have formed a plan . ” Caderousse ’ s plans alarmed Andrea still more than his ideas ; ideas were but the <unk> , the plan was reality .
“ Let me see your plan ; I dare say it is a pretty one . ” “ Why not ?
Who formed the plan by which we left the establishment of <unk> — — !
<unk> ?
was it not I ?
and it was no bad one I believe , since here we are ! ” “ I do not say , ” replied Andrea , “ that you never make a good one ; but let us see your plan . ” “ Well , ” pursued Caderousse , “ can you without <unk> one sou , put me in the way of getting fifteen thousand francs ?
No , fifteen thousand are not enough , — I cannot again become an honest man with less than thirty thousand francs . ” “ No , ” replied Andrea , <unk> , “ no , I cannot . ” “ I do not think you understand me , ” replied Caderousse , calmly ; “ I said without your laying out a sou . ” “ Do you want me to commit a <unk> , to <unk> all my good fortune — and yours with mine — and both of us to be dragged down there again ? ” “ It would make very little difference to me , ” said Caderousse , “ if I were <unk> , I am a poor creature to live alone , and sometimes <unk> for my old comrades ; not like you , <unk> creature , who would be glad never to see them again . ” Andrea did more than tremble this time , he turned pale .
“ Come , Caderousse , no nonsense ! ” said he .
“ Don ’ t alarm yourself , my little Benedetto , but just point out to me some means of <unk> those thirty thousand francs without your assistance , and I will <unk> it . ” “ Well , I ’ ll see — I ’ ll try to <unk> some way , ” said Andrea .
“ Meanwhile you will raise my <unk> <unk> to five hundred francs , my little fellow ?
I have a fancy , and mean to get a housekeeper . ” “ Well , you shall have your five hundred francs , ” said Andrea ; “ but it is very hard for me , my poor Caderousse — you take advantage — — ” “ Bah , ” said Caderousse , “ when you have access to <unk> <unk> . ” One would have said Andrea anticipated his companion ’ s words , so did his eye flash like lightning , but it was but for a moment .
“ True , ” he replied , “ and my protector is very kind . ” “ That dear protector , ” said Caderousse ; “ and how much does he give you <unk> ? ” “ Five thousand francs . ” “ As many thousands as you give me <unk> !
<unk> , it is only <unk> who are thus fortunate .
Five thousand francs per month !
What the devil can you do with all that ? ” “ Oh , it is no trouble to spend that ; and I am like you , I want capital . ” “ <unk> ? — yes — I understand — everyone would like capital . ” “ Well , and I shall get it . ” “ Who will give it to you — your prince ? ” “ Yes , my prince .
But unfortunately I must wait . ” <unk> “ You must wait for what ? ” asked Caderousse .
“ For his death . ” “ The death of your prince ? ” “ Yes . ” “ How so ? ” “ Because he has made his will in my favor . ” “ Indeed ? ” “ On my honor . ” “ For how much ? ” “ For five hundred thousand . ” “ Only that ?
It ’ s little enough . ” “ But so it is . ” “ No , it cannot be ! ” “ Are you my friend , Caderousse ? ” “ Yes , in life or death . ” “ Well , I will tell you a secret . ” “ What is it ? ” “ But remember — — ” “ Ah !
_ <unk> ! _ mute as a <unk> . ” “ Well , I think — — ” Andrea stopped and looked around .
“ You think ?
Do not fear ; _ <unk> ! _ we are alone . ” “ I think I have discovered my father . ” “ Your true father ? ” “ Yes . ” “ Not old Cavalcanti ? ” “ No , for he has gone again ; the true one , as you say . ” “ And that father is — — ” “ Well , Caderousse , it is Monte Cristo . ” “ Bah ! ” “ Yes , you understand , that <unk> all .
He cannot acknowledge me <unk> , it appears , but he does it through M. Cavalcanti , and gives him fifty thousand francs for it . ” “ <unk> thousand francs for being your father ?
I would have done it for half that , for twenty thousand , for fifteen thousand ; why did you not think of me , <unk> man ? ” “ Did I know anything about it , when it was all done when I was down there ? ” “ Ah , truly ?
And you say that by his will — — ” “ He leaves me five hundred thousand livres . ” “ Are you sure of it ? ” “ He showed it me ; but that is not all — there is a <unk> , as I said just now . ” “ <unk> . ” “ And in that <unk> he <unk> me . ” “ Oh , the good father , the brave father , the very honest father ! ” said Caderousse , <unk> a plate in the air between his two hands .
“ Now , say if I conceal anything from you ? ” “ No , and your confidence makes you honorable in my opinion ; and your <unk> father , is he rich , very rich ? ” “ Yes , he is that ; he does not himself know the amount of his fortune . ” “ Is it possible ? ” “ It is evident enough to me , who am always at his house .
The other day a banker ’ s clerk brought him fifty thousand francs in a <unk> about the size of your plate ; yesterday his banker brought him a hundred thousand francs in gold . ” Caderousse was filled with wonder ; the young man ’ s words sounded to him like <unk> , and he thought he could hear the rushing of <unk> of louis .
“ And you go into that house ? ” cried he <unk> .
“ When I like . ” Caderousse was thoughtful for a moment .
It was easy to perceive he was <unk> some unfortunate idea in his mind .
Then suddenly , — “ How I should like to see all that , ” cried he ; “ how beautiful it must be ! ” “ It is , in fact , magnificent , ” said Andrea .
“ And does he not live in the Champs-Élysées ? ” “ Yes , No .
30 . ” “ Ah , ” said Caderousse , “ No .
30 . ” “ Yes , a fine house standing alone , between a courtyard and a garden , — you must know it . ” “ <unk> ; but it is not the <unk> I care for , it is the interior .
What beautiful furniture there must be in it ! ” “ Have you ever seen the Tuileries ? ” “ No . ” “ Well , it <unk> that . ” “ It must be worth one ’ s while to <unk> , Andrea , when that good M. Monte Cristo <unk> fall his purse . ” “ It is not <unk> to wait for that , ” said Andrea ; “ money is as <unk> in that house as fruit in an <unk> . ” “ But you should take me there one day with you . ” “ How can I ?
On what <unk> ? ” “ You are right ; but you have made my mouth water .
I must absolutely see it ; I shall find a way . ” “ No nonsense , Caderousse ! ” “ I will offer myself as <unk> . ” “ The rooms are all <unk> . ” “ Well , then , I must be contented to imagine it . ” “ That is the best plan , believe me . ” “ <unk> , at least , to give me an idea of what it is . ” “ How can I ? ” “ Nothing is <unk> .
Is it large ? ” “ <unk> . ” “ How is it arranged ? ” “ <unk> , I should require pen , ink , and paper to make a plan . ” “ They are all here , ” said Caderousse , <unk> .
He <unk> from an old <unk> a sheet of white paper and pen and ink .
“ Here , ” said Caderousse , “ draw me all that on the paper , my boy . ” Andrea took the pen with an imperceptible smile and began .
“ The house , as I said , is between the court and the garden ; in this way , do you see ? ” Andrea drew the garden , the court and the house .
<unk> “ <unk> walls ? ” “ Not more than eight or ten feet . ” “ That is not prudent , ” said Caderousse .
“ In the court are <unk> in <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> of flowers . ” “ And no <unk> ? ” “ No . ” “ The <unk> ? ” “ Are on either side of the gate , which you see there . ” And Andrea continued his plan .
“ Let us see the ground floor , ” said Caderousse .
“ On the ground floor , dining-room , two <unk> , <unk> , staircase in the hall , and a little back staircase . ” “ <unk> ? ” “ <unk> windows , so beautiful , so large , that I believe a man of your size should pass through each frame . ” “ Why the devil have they any stairs with such windows ? ” “ <unk> has everything . ” “ But shutters ? ” “ Yes , but they are never used .
That Count of Monte Cristo is an original , who loves to look at the sky even at night . ” “ And where do the servants sleep ? ” “ Oh , they have a house to themselves .
<unk> to yourself a pretty <unk> at the <unk> side where the <unk> are kept .
Well , over that <unk> are the servants ’ rooms , with <unk> <unk> with the different apartments . ” “ Ah , _ <unk> ! _ <unk> did you say ? ” “ What do you mean ? ” “ Oh , nothing !
I only say they cost a <unk> of money to hang , and what is the use of them , I should like to know ? ” “ There used to be a dog let loose in the yard at night , but it has been taken to the house at Auteuil , to that you went to , you know . ” “ Yes . ” “ I was saying to him only yesterday , ‘ You are imprudent , Monsieur Count ; for when you go to Auteuil and take your servants the house is left <unk> . ’ ‘ Well , ’ said he , ‘ what next ? ’ ‘ Well , next , some day you will be robbed . ’ ” “ What did he answer ? ” “ He quietly said , ‘ What do I care if I am ? ’ ” “ Andrea , he has some <unk> with a spring . ” “ How do you know ? ” “ Yes , which <unk> the thief in a trap and plays a <unk> .
I was told there were such at the last <unk> . ” “ He has simply a <unk> <unk> , in which the key is always kept . ” “ And he is not robbed ? ” “ No ; his servants are all devoted to him . ” “ There ought to be some money in that <unk> ? ” “ There may be .
No one knows what there is . ” “ And where is it ? ” “ On the first floor . ” “ <unk> me the plan of that floor , as you have done of the ground floor , my boy . ” “ That is very simple . ” Andrea took the pen .
“ On the first story , do you see , there is the <unk> and the drawing-room ; to the right of the drawing-room , a library and a study ; to the left , a bedroom and a dressing-room .
The famous <unk> is in the dressing-room . ” “ Is there a window in the dressing-room ? ” “ Two , — one here and one there . ” Andrea <unk> two windows in the room , which formed an angle on the plan , and appeared as a small square added to the <unk> of the bedroom .
Caderousse became thoughtful .
“ Does he often go to Auteuil ? ” added he .
“ Two or three times a week .
<unk> , for instance , he is going to spend the day and night there . ” “ Are you sure of it ? ” “ He has invited me to dine there . ” “ There ’ s a life for you , ” said Caderousse ; “ a town house and a country house . ” “ That is what it is to be rich . ” “ And shall you dine there ? ” “ <unk> . ” “ When you dine there , do you sleep there ? ” “ If I like ; I am at home there . ” Caderousse looked at the young man , as if to get at the truth from the bottom of his heart .
But Andrea drew a <unk> from his pocket , took a <unk> , quietly lit it , and began smoking .
“ When do you want your twelve hundred francs ? ” said he to Caderousse .
“ Now , if you have them . ” Andrea took <unk> louis from his pocket .
“ <unk> boys ? ” said Caderousse ; “ no , I thank you . ” “ Oh , you <unk> them . ” “ On the contrary , I esteem them , but will not have them . ” “ You can change them , <unk> ; gold is worth five sous . ” “ Exactly ; and he who changes them will follow friend Caderousse , lay hands on him , and demand what <unk> pay him their rent in gold .
No nonsense , my good fellow ; silver simply , round <unk> with the head of some <unk> or other on them .
<unk> may possess a <unk> piece . ” “ But do you suppose I carry five hundred francs about with me ?
I should want a porter . ” “ Well , leave them with your porter ; he is to be trusted .
I will call for them . ” “ <unk> ? ” “ No , tomorrow ; I shall not have time today . ” “ Well , tomorrow I will leave them when I go to Auteuil . ” “ May I depend on it ? ” “ Certainly . ” “ Because I shall secure my housekeeper on the strength of it . ” “ Now see here , will that be all ?
<unk> ?
And will you not <unk> me any more ? ” “ Never . ” Caderousse had become so gloomy that Andrea feared he should be obliged to notice the change .
He redoubled his gayety and <unk> .
“ How <unk> you are , ” said Caderousse ; “ One would say you were already in possession of your property . ” “ No , unfortunately ; but when I do obtain it — — ” “ Well ? ” “ I shall remember old friends , I can tell you that . ” “ Yes , since you have such a good memory . ” “ What do you want ?
It looks as if you were trying to <unk> me ? ” “ I ?
What an idea !
I , who am going to give you another piece of good advice . ” “ What is it ? ” “ To leave behind you the diamond you have on your finger .
We shall both get into trouble .
You will ruin both yourself and me by your folly . ” “ How so ? ” said Andrea .
“ How ?
You put on a <unk> , you disguise yourself as a servant , and yet keep a diamond on your finger worth four or five thousand francs . ” “ You guess well . ” “ I know something of diamonds ; I have had some . ” “ You do well to boast of it , ” said Andrea , who , without becoming angry , as Caderousse feared , at this new <unk> , quietly resigned the ring .
Caderousse looked so closely at it that Andrea well knew that he was examining to see if all the <unk> were perfect .
“ It is a false diamond , ” said Caderousse .
“ You are <unk> now , ” replied Andrea .
“ Do not be angry , we can try it . ” Caderousse went to the window , touched the glass with it , and found it would cut .
“ _ <unk> ! _ ” said Caderousse , putting the diamond on his little finger ; “ I was mistaken ; but those thieves of <unk> <unk> so well that it is no longer <unk> to <unk> a jeweller ’ s shop — it is another branch of <unk> <unk> . ” “ Have you finished ? ” said Andrea , — “ do you want anything more ? — will you have my waistcoat or my hat ?
Make free , now you have begun . ” “ No ; you are , after all , a good companion ; I will not <unk> you , and will try to cure myself of my ambition . ” “ But take care the same thing does not happen to you in <unk> the diamond you feared with the gold . ” “ I shall not sell it — do not fear . ” “ Not at least till the day after tomorrow , ” thought the young man .
“ <unk> <unk> , ” said Caderousse ; “ you are going to find your servants , your horses , your carriage , and your betrothed ! ” “ Yes , ” said Andrea .
“ Well , I hope you will make a handsome <unk> the day you marry Mademoiselle Danglars . ” “ I have already told you it is a fancy you have taken in your head . ” “ What fortune has she ? ” “ But I tell you — — ” “ A million ? ” Andrea shrugged his shoulders .
“ Let it be a million , ” said Caderousse ; “ you can never have so much as I wish you . ” “ Thank you , ” said the young man .
“ Oh , I wish it you with all my heart ! ” added Caderousse with his hoarse laugh .
“ Stop , let me show you the way . ” “ It is not <unk> . ” “ Yes , it is . ” “ Why ? ” “ Because there is a little secret , a precaution I thought it desirable to take , one of <unk> &amp; <unk> ’ s locks , <unk> and <unk> by <unk> Caderousse ; I will <unk> you a similar one when you are a <unk> . ” “ Thank you , ” said Andrea ; “ I will let you know a week beforehand . ” They parted .
Caderousse remained on the landing until he had not only seen Andrea go down the three stories , but also cross the court .
Then he returned hastily , shut his door carefully , and began to study , like a clever <unk> , the plan Andrea had left him .
“ Dear Benedetto , ” said he , “ I think he will not be sorry to <unk> his fortune , and he who <unk> the day when he can touch his five hundred thousand will not be his worst friend . ” Chapter <unk> .
The <unk> The day following that on which the conversation we have related took place , the Count of Monte Cristo set out for Auteuil , accompanied by Ali and several attendants , and also taking with him some horses whose qualities he was desirous of <unk> .
He was induced to <unk> this journey , of which the day before he had not even thought and which had not occurred to Andrea either , by the arrival of Bertuccio from <unk> with intelligence respecting the house and <unk> .
The house was ready , and the <unk> which had arrived a week before lay at anchor in a small <unk> with her crew of six men , who had observed all the requisite <unk> and were ready again to put to sea .
The count <unk> Bertuccio ’ s <unk> , and ordered him to prepare for a <unk> departure , as his stay in France would not be prolonged more than a month .
“ Now , ” said he , “ I may require to go in one night from Paris to <unk> ; let eight fresh horses be in readiness on the road , which will <unk> me to go fifty leagues in ten hours . ” “ Your <unk> had already expressed that wish , ” said Bertuccio , “ and the horses are ready .
I have bought them , and stationed them myself at the most desirable <unk> , that is , in <unk> , where no one generally <unk> . ” “ That ’ s well , ” said Monte Cristo ; “ I remain here a day or two — arrange accordingly . ” As Bertuccio was leaving the room to give the requisite orders , Baptistin opened the door : he held a letter on a silver waiter .
“ What are you doing here ? ” asked the count , seeing him covered with dust ; “ I did not send for you , I think ? ” Baptistin , without answering , approached the count , and presented the letter .
“ <unk> and <unk> , ” said he .
The count opened the letter , and read : “ ‘ M.
de Monte Cristo is <unk> that this night a man will enter his house in the Champs-Élysées with the intention of carrying off some papers supposed to be in the <unk> in the dressing-room .
The count ’ s <unk> courage will render unnecessary the aid of the police , whose interference might seriously affect him who sends this advice .
The count , by any opening from the bedroom , or by <unk> himself in the dressing-room , would be able to defend his property himself .
Many attendants or apparent precautions would prevent the <unk> from the attempt , and M. de Monte Cristo would lose the opportunity of <unk> an enemy whom chance has revealed to him who now sends this warning to the count , — a warning he might not be able to send another time , if this first attempt should fail and another be made . ’ ” The count ’ s first idea was that this was an <unk> — a <unk> <unk> , to draw his attention from a <unk> danger in order to <unk> him to a greater .
He was on the point of sending the letter to the <unk> of police , notwithstanding the advice of his <unk> friend , or perhaps because of that advice , when suddenly the idea occurred to him that it might be some personal enemy , whom he alone should recognize and over whom , if such were the case , he alone would gain any advantage , as <unk> had done over the <unk> who would have killed him .
We know the count ’ s <unk> and daring mind , <unk> anything to be impossible , with that energy which marks the great man .
From his past life , from his resolution to <unk> from nothing , the count had acquired an <unk> <unk> for the <unk> in which he had engaged , sometimes against nature , that is to say , against God , and sometimes against the world , that is , against the devil .
“ They do not want my papers , ” said Monte Cristo , “ they want to kill me ; they are no <unk> , but <unk> .
I will not allow the prefect of police to interfere with my private affairs .
I am rich enough , <unk> , to distribute his authority on this occasion . ” The count recalled Baptistin , who had left the room after <unk> the letter .
“ <unk> to Paris , ” said he ; “ <unk> the servants who remain there .
I want all my household at Auteuil . ” “ But will no one remain in the house , my lord ? ” asked Baptistin .
“ Yes , the porter . ” “ My lord will remember that the lodge is at a distance from the house . ” “ Well ? ” “ The house might be <unk> without his hearing the least noise . ” “ By whom ? ” “ By thieves . ” “ You are a fool , M. Baptistin .
<unk> might <unk> the house — it would <unk> me less than to be <unk> . ” Baptistin bowed .
<unk> “ You understand me ? ” said the count .
“ <unk> your comrades here , one and all ; but let everything remain as usual , only close the shutters of the ground floor . ” “ And those of the first floor ? ” “ You know they are never closed .
Go ! ” The count signified his intention of <unk> alone , and that no one but Ali should attend him .
Having dined with his usual tranquillity and <unk> , the count , making a signal to Ali to follow him , went out by the <unk> and on reaching the <unk> de <unk> turned , apparently without design towards Paris and at twilight ; found himself opposite his house in the Champs-Élysées .
All was dark ; one solitary , feeble light was burning in the porter ’ s lodge , about forty paces distant from the house , as Baptistin had said .
Monte Cristo leaned against a tree , and with that <unk> glance which was so rarely deceived , looked up and down the <unk> , examined the passers-by , and carefully looked down the neighboring streets , to see that no one was concealed .
Ten minutes passed thus , and he was convinced that no one was watching him .
He hastened to the <unk> with Ali , entered <unk> , and by the servants ’ staircase , of which he had the key , gained his bedroom without opening or <unk> a single curtain , without even the porter having the slightest suspicion that the house , which he supposed empty , contained its chief <unk> .
<unk> in his bedroom , the count motioned to Ali to stop ; then he passed into the dressing-room , which he examined .
Everything appeared as usual — the precious <unk> in its place , and the key in the <unk> .
He double locked it , took the key , returned to the bedroom door , removed the double <unk> of the bolt , and went in .
Meanwhile Ali had procured the arms the count required — <unk> , a short <unk> and a pair of <unk> pistols , with which as sure an aim might be taken as with a <unk> one .
Thus armed , the count held the lives of five men in his hands .
It was about half-past nine .
The count and Ali ate in haste a <unk> of bread and drank a glass of Spanish wine ; then Monte Cristo slipped aside one of the <unk> <unk> , which enabled him to see into the adjoining room .
He had within his reach his pistols and <unk> , and Ali , standing near him , held one of the small Arabian <unk> , whose form has not varied since the <unk> .
Through one of the windows of the bedroom , on a line with that in the dressing-room , the count could see into the street .
Two hours passed thus .
It was <unk> dark ; still Ali , thanks to his wild nature , and the count , thanks doubtless to his long <unk> , could distinguish in the darkness the slightest movement of the trees .
The little light in the lodge had long been <unk> .
It might be expected that the attack , if indeed an attack was projected , would be made from the staircase of the ground floor , and not from a window ; in Monte Cristo ’ s opinion , the <unk> sought his life , not his money .
It would be his bedroom they would attack , and they must reach it by the back staircase , or by the window in the dressing-room .
The clock of the <unk> struck a quarter to twelve ; the <unk> wind bore on its <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> of the three <unk> .
<unk> As the last stroke died away , the count thought he heard a slight noise in the dressing-room ; this first sound , or rather this first <unk> , was followed by a second , then a third ; at the fourth , the count knew what to expect .
A firm and <unk> hand was engaged in cutting the four sides of a <unk> of glass with a diamond .
The count felt his heart beat more rapidly .
<unk> as men may be to danger , <unk> as they may be of peril , they understand , by the <unk> of the heart and the shuddering of the frame , the enormous difference between a dream and a reality , between the project and the execution .
However , Monte Cristo only made a sign to <unk> Ali , who , understanding that danger was approaching from the other side , drew nearer to his master .
Monte Cristo was eager to ascertain the strength and number of his enemies .
The window whence the noise proceeded was opposite the opening by which the count could see into the dressing-room .
He fixed his eyes on that window — he distinguished a shadow in the darkness ; then one of the <unk> became quite <unk> , as if a sheet of paper were <unk> on the outside , then the square cracked without falling .
Through the opening an arm was passed to find the <unk> , then a second ; the window turned on its hinges , and a man entered .
He was alone .
“ That ’ s a daring rascal , ” whispered the count .
At that moment Ali touched him slightly on the shoulder .
He turned ; Ali pointed to the window of the room in which they were , facing the street .
“ I see ! ” said he , “ there are two of them ; one does the work while the other stands guard . ” He made a sign to Ali not to lose sight of the man in the street , and turned to the one in the dressing-room .
The <unk> had entered , and was feeling his way , his arms stretched out before him .
At last he appeared to have made himself familiar with his <unk> .
There were two doors ; he <unk> them both .
When he drew near to the bedroom door , Monte Cristo expected that he was coming in , and raised one of his pistols ; but he simply heard the sound of the bolts <unk> in their <unk> <unk> .
It was only a precaution .
The nocturnal visitor , ignorant of the fact that the count had removed the <unk> , might now think himself at home , and pursue his purpose with full security .
<unk> and free to act as he wished , the man then drew from his pocket something which the count could not <unk> , placed it on a stand , then went straight to the <unk> , felt the lock , and contrary to his expectation found that the key was missing .
But the <unk> was a prudent man who had provided for all <unk> .
The count soon heard the <unk> of a bunch of <unk> keys , such as the <unk> brings when called to force a lock , and which thieves call <unk> , doubtless from the music of their <unk> song when they <unk> against the bolt .
“ Ah , <unk> , ” whispered Monte Cristo with a smile of disappointment , “ he is only a thief . ” But the man in the dark could not find the right key .
He reached the instrument he had placed on the stand , touched a spring , and immediately a pale light , just bright enough to render objects distinct , was reflected on his hands and countenance .
“ By heavens , ” exclaimed Monte Cristo , starting back , “ it is — — ” Ali raised his <unk> .
“ Don ’ t stir , ” whispered Monte Cristo , “ and put down your <unk> ; we shall require no arms . ” <unk> Then he added some words in a low tone , for the exclamation which surprise had drawn from the count , faint as it had been , had startled the man who remained in the <unk> of the old <unk> .
It was an order the count had just given , for immediately Ali went <unk> , and returned , bearing a black dress and a <unk> hat .
Meanwhile Monte Cristo had rapidly taken off his <unk> , waistcoat , and shirt , and one might distinguish by the <unk> through the open <unk> that he wore a <unk> <unk> of steel <unk> , of which the last in France , where <unk> are no longer dreaded , was worn by King Louis <unk> . , who feared the <unk> at his breast , and whose head was <unk> with a <unk> .
The <unk> soon disappeared under a long <unk> , as did his hair under a priest ’ s <unk> ; the <unk> hat over this <unk> <unk> the count into an abbé .
The man , hearing nothing more , stood erect , and while Monte Cristo was <unk> his disguise had advanced straight to the <unk> , whose lock was beginning to <unk> under his <unk> .
“ <unk> again , ” whispered the count , who depended on the secret spring , which was unknown to the <unk> , clever as he might be — “ try again , you have a few minutes ’ work there . ” And he advanced to the window .
The man whom he had seen seated on a fence had got down , and was still <unk> the street ; but , strange as it appeared , he cared not for those who might pass from the <unk> of the Champs-Élysées or by the Faubourg <unk> ; his attention was <unk> with what was passing at the count ’ s , and his only aim appeared to be to <unk> every movement in the dressing-room .
Monte Cristo suddenly struck his finger on his forehead and a smile passed over his lips ; then drawing near to Ali , he whispered : “ <unk> here , concealed in the dark , and whatever noise you hear , whatever passes , only come in or show yourself if I call you . ” Ali bowed in <unk> of strict obedience .
Monte Cristo then drew a lighted <unk> from a <unk> , and when the thief was deeply engaged with his lock , silently opened the door , taking care that the light should <unk> directly on his face .
The door opened so quietly that the thief heard no sound ; but , to his astonishment , the room was suddenly illuminated .
He turned .
“ Ah , <unk> , my dear M. Caderousse , ” said Monte Cristo ; “ what are you doing here , at such an hour ? ” <unk> “ The Abbé Busoni ! ” exclaimed Caderousse ; and , not knowing how this strange apparition could have entered when he had <unk> the doors , he let fall his bunch of keys , and remained motionless and stupefied .
The count placed himself between Caderousse and the window , thus cutting off from the thief his only chance of retreat .
“ The Abbé Busoni ! ” repeated Caderousse , fixing his haggard gaze on the count .
“ Yes , undoubtedly , the Abbé Busoni himself , ” replied Monte Cristo .
“ And I am very glad you recognize me , dear M. Caderousse ; it <unk> you have a good memory , for it must be about ten years since we last met . ” This calmness of Busoni , combined with his <unk> and <unk> , <unk> Caderousse .
“ The abbé , the abbé ! ” murmured he , <unk> his <unk> , and his teeth <unk> .
“ So you would <unk> the Count of Monte Cristo ? ” continued the false abbé .
“ <unk> sir , ” murmured Caderousse , seeking to <unk> the window , which the count <unk> <unk> — “ reverend sir , I don ’ t know — believe me — I take my oath — — ” “ A <unk> of glass out , ” continued the count , “ a dark lantern , a bunch of false keys , a <unk> half forced — it is tolerably evident — — ” Caderousse was <unk> ; he looked around for some corner to hide in , some way of escape .
“ Come , come , ” continued the count , “ I see you are still the same , — an assassin . ” “ <unk> sir , since you know everything , you know it was not I — it was La Carconte ; that was proved at the trial , since I was only condemned to the galleys . ” “ Is your time , then , <unk> , since I find you in a fair way to return there ? ” “ No , reverend sir ; I have been <unk> by someone . ” “ That someone has done society a great kindness . ” “ Ah , ” said Caderousse , “ I had promised — — ” “ And you are breaking your promise ! ” interrupted Monte Cristo .
“ Alas , yes ! ” said Caderousse very <unk> .
“ A bad <unk> , that will lead you , if I mistake not , to the Place de <unk> .
So much the worse , so much the worse — _ <unk> ! _ as they say in my country . ” “ <unk> sir , I am <unk> — — ” “ Every criminal says the same thing . ” “ <unk> — — ” “ <unk> ! ” said Busoni <unk> ; “ poverty may make a man beg , <unk> a <unk> of bread at a baker ’ s door , but not cause him to open a <unk> in a house supposed to be inhabited .
And when the jeweller <unk> had just paid you <unk> francs for the diamond I had given you , and you killed him to get the diamond and the money both , was that also poverty ? ” “ Pardon , reverend sir , ” said Caderousse ; “ you have saved my life once , save me again ! ” “ That is but poor encouragement . ” “ Are you alone , reverend sir , or have you there soldiers ready to seize me ? ” “ I am alone , ” said the abbé , “ and I will again have pity on you , and will let you escape , at the risk of the fresh miseries my weakness may lead to , if you tell me the truth . ” “ Ah , reverend sir , ” cried Caderousse , <unk> his hands , and drawing nearer to Monte Cristo , “ I may indeed say you are my <unk> ! ” “ You mean to say you have been <unk> from <unk> ? ” “ Yes , that is true , reverend sir . ” “ Who was your <unk> ? ” “ An Englishman . ” “ What was his name ? ” “ Lord Wilmore . ” “ I know him ; I shall know if you lie . ” “ Ah , reverend sir , I tell you the simple truth . ” “ Was this Englishman <unk> you ? ” “ No , not me , but a young Corsican , my companion . ” “ What was this young Corsican ’ s name ? ” “ Benedetto . ” “ Is that his Christian name ? ” “ He had no other ; he was a <unk> . ” “ Then this young man escaped with you ? ” “ He did . ” “ In what way ? ” “ We were working at <unk> , near Toulon .
Do you know <unk> ? ” “ I do . ” “ In the hour of rest , between noon and one o ’ clock — — ” “ <unk> having a <unk> after dinner !
We may well pity the poor fellows ! ” said the abbé .
“ Nay , ” said Caderousse , “ one can ’ t always work — one is not a dog . ” “ So much the better for the dogs , ” said Monte Cristo .
“ While the rest slept , then , we went away a short distance ; we <unk> our <unk> with a file the Englishman had given us , and <unk> away . ” “ And what is become of this Benedetto ? ” “ I don ’ t know . ” “ You ought to know . ” “ No , in truth ; we parted at <unk> . ” And , to give more weight to his <unk> , Caderousse advanced another step towards the abbé , who remained motionless in his place , as calm as ever , and pursuing his <unk> .
“ You lie , ” said the Abbé Busoni , with a tone of irresistible authority .
“ <unk> sir ! ” “ You lie !
This man is still your friend , and you , perhaps , make use of him as your <unk> . ” <unk> “ Oh , reverend sir ! ” “ Since you left Toulon what have you lived on ?
<unk> me ! ” “ On what I could get . ” “ You lie , ” repeated the abbé a third time , with a still more <unk> tone .
Caderousse , terrified , looked at the count .
“ You have lived on the money he has given you . ” “ True , ” said Caderousse ; “ Benedetto has become the son of a great lord . ” “ How can he be the son of a great lord ? ” “ A natural son . ” “ And what is that great lord ’ s name ? ” “ The Count of Monte Cristo , the very same in whose house we are . ” “ Benedetto the count ’ s son ? ” replied Monte Cristo , astonished in his turn .
“ Well , I should think so , since the count has found him a false father — since the count gives him four thousand francs a month , and leaves him <unk> francs in his will . ” “ Ah , yes , ” said the <unk> abbé , who began to understand ; “ and what name does the young man bear meanwhile ? ” “ Andrea Cavalcanti . ” “ Is it , then , that young man whom my friend the Count of Monte Cristo has received into his house , and who is going to marry Mademoiselle Danglars ? ” “ Exactly . ” “ And you suffer that , you wretch ! — you , who know his life and his crime ? ” “ Why should I stand in a comrade ’ s way ? ” said Caderousse .
“ You are right ; it is not you who should <unk> M. Danglars , it is I. ” “ Do not do so , reverend sir . ” “ Why not ? ” “ Because you would bring us to ruin . ” “ And you think that to save such <unk> as you I will become an <unk> of their plot , an <unk> in their crimes ? ” “ <unk> sir , ” said Caderousse , drawing still nearer .
“ I will <unk> all . ” “ To whom ? ” “ To M. Danglars . ” “ By Heaven ! ” cried Caderousse , drawing from his waistcoat an open knife , and striking the count in the breast , “ you shall <unk> nothing , reverend sir ! ” To Caderousse ’ s great astonishment , the knife , instead of piercing the count ’ s breast , flew back <unk> .
At the same moment the count seized with his left hand the assassin ’ s <unk> , and <unk> it with such strength that the knife fell from his <unk> fingers , and Caderousse uttered a cry of pain .
But the count , <unk> his cry , continued to <unk> the bandit ’ s <unk> , until , his arm being <unk> , he fell first on his knees , then flat on the floor .
The count then placed his foot on his head , saying , “ I know not what <unk> me from crushing thy <unk> , rascal . ” “ Ah , mercy — mercy ! ” cried Caderousse .
The count withdrew his foot .
<unk> “ <unk> ! ” said he .
Caderousse rose .
“ What a <unk> you have , reverend sir ! ” said Caderousse , <unk> his arm , all <unk> by the <unk> <unk> which had held it ; “ what a <unk> ! ” “ Silence !
God gives me strength to overcome a wild beast like you ; in the name of that God I act , — remember that , wretch , — and to spare thee at this moment is still <unk> him . ” “ Oh ! ” said Caderousse , <unk> with pain .
“ Take this pen and paper , and write what I <unk> . ” “ I don ’ t know how to write , reverend sir . ” “ You lie !
Take this pen , and write ! ” Caderousse , <unk> by the superior power of the abbé , sat down and wrote : “ Sir , — The man whom you are receiving at your house , and to whom you intend to marry your daughter , is a <unk> who escaped with me from <unk> at Toulon .
He was No .
<unk> , and I No .
<unk> .
He was called Benedetto , but he is ignorant of his real name , having never known his parents . ” “ <unk> it ! ” continued the count .
“ But would you ruin me ? ” “ If I sought your ruin , fool , I should drag you to the first <unk> ; besides , when that note is delivered , in all probability you will have no more to fear .
<unk> it , then ! ” Caderousse signed it .
“ The address , ‘ To monsieur the Baron Danglars , banker , Rue de la <unk> d ’ <unk> . ’ ” Caderousse wrote the address .
The abbé took the note .
“ Now , ” said he , “ that suffices — <unk> ! ” “ Which way ? ” “ The way you came . ” “ You wish me to get out at that window ? ” “ You got in very well . ” “ Oh , you have some design against me , reverend sir . ” “ <unk> !
what design can I have ? ” “ Why , then , not let me out by the door ? ” “ What would be the advantage of waking the porter ? ” “ Ah , reverend sir , tell me , do you wish me dead ? ” “ I wish what God <unk> . ” “ But swear that you will not strike me as I go down . ” “ <unk> fool ! ” “ What do you intend doing with me ? ” “ I ask you what can I do ?
I have tried to make you a happy man , and you have turned out a murderer . ” “ Oh , monsieur , ” said Caderousse , “ make one more attempt — try me once more ! ” “ I will , ” said the count .
“ Listen — you know if I may be <unk> on . ” “ Yes , ” said Caderousse .
“ If you arrive safely at home — — ” “ What have I to fear , except from you ? ” “ If you reach your home safely , leave Paris , leave France , and wherever you may be , so long as you conduct yourself well , I will send you a small <unk> ; for , if you return home safely , then — — ” “ Then ? ” asked Caderousse , shuddering .
<unk> “ Then I shall believe God has <unk> you , and I will forgive you too . ” “ As true as I am a Christian , ” stammered Caderousse , “ you will make me die of fright ! ” “ Now <unk> , ” said the count , pointing to the window .
Caderousse , scarcely yet <unk> on this promise , put his legs out of the window and stood on the ladder .
“ Now go down , ” said the abbé , <unk> his arms .
<unk> he had nothing more to fear from him , Caderousse began to go down .
Then the count brought the <unk> to the window , that it might be seen in the Champs-Élysées that a man was getting out of the window while another held a light .
“ What are you doing , reverend sir ?
<unk> a <unk> should pass ? ” And he blew out the light .
He then descended , but it was only when he felt his foot touch the ground that he was satisfied of his safety .
Monte Cristo returned to his bedroom , and , glancing rapidly from the garden to the street , he saw first Caderousse , who after walking to the end of the garden , fixed his ladder against the wall at a different part from where he came in .
The count then looking over into the street , saw the man who appeared to be waiting run in the same direction , and place himself against the angle of the wall where Caderousse would come over .
Caderousse <unk> the ladder slowly , and looked over the <unk> to see if the street was quiet .
No one could be seen or heard .
The clock of the <unk> struck one .
Then Caderousse sat <unk> the <unk> , and drawing up his ladder passed it over the wall ; then he began to descend , or rather to <unk> down by the two <unk> , which he did with an ease which proved how accustomed he was to the exercise .
But , once started , he could not stop .
In vain did he see a man start from the shadow when he was <unk> down — in vain did he see an arm raised as he touched the ground .
Before he could defend himself that arm struck him so violently in the back that he let go the ladder , crying , “ <unk> ! ” A second blow struck him almost immediately in the side , and he fell , calling , “ <unk> , murder ! ” Then , as he rolled on the ground , his <unk> seized him by the hair , and struck him a third blow in the chest .
This time Caderousse endeavored to call again , but he could only utter a groan , and he shuddered as the blood flowed from his three wounds .
The assassin , finding that he no longer cried out , lifted his head up by the hair ; his eyes were closed , and the mouth was <unk> .
The murderer , supposing him dead , let fall his head and disappeared .
Then Caderousse , feeling that he was leaving him , raised himself on his elbow , and with a dying voice cried with great effort : “ <unk> !
I am dying !
<unk> , reverend sir , — help ! ” This mournful appeal pierced the darkness .
The door of the <unk> opened , then the <unk> of the garden , and Ali and his master were on the spot with lights .
Chapter <unk> .
The <unk> of God Caderousse continued to call <unk> , “ <unk> , reverend sir , help ! ” “ What is the matter ? ” asked Monte Cristo .
“ <unk> , ” cried Caderousse ; “ I am murdered ! ” “ We are here ; — take courage . ” “ Ah , it ’ s all over !
You are come too late — you are come to see me die .
What blows , what blood ! ” He fainted .
Ali and his master conveyed the wounded man into a room .
Monte Cristo motioned to Ali to <unk> him , and he then examined his dreadful wounds .
“ My God ! ” he exclaimed , “ thy vengeance is sometimes delayed , but only that it may fall the more <unk> . ” Ali looked at his master for further instructions .
“ <unk> here immediately the king ’ s attorney , M. de Villefort , who lives in the Faubourg <unk> .
As you pass the lodge , wake the porter , and send him for a <unk> . ” Ali obeyed , leaving the abbé alone with Caderousse , who had not yet <unk> .
When the wretched man again opened his eyes , the count looked at him with a mournful expression of pity , and his lips moved as if in prayer .
“ A <unk> , reverend sir — a <unk> ! ” said Caderousse .
“ I have sent for one , ” replied the abbé .
“ I know he cannot save my life , but he may <unk> me to give my evidence . ” “ <unk> whom ? ” “ <unk> my murderer . ” “ Did you recognize him ? ” “ Yes ; it was Benedetto . ” “ The young Corsican ? ” “ <unk> . ” “ Your comrade ? ” “ Yes .
After giving me the plan of this house , doubtless hoping I should kill the count and he thus become his heir , or that the count would kill me and I should be out of his way , he <unk> me , and has murdered me . ” “ I have also sent for the procureur . ” “ He will not come in time ; I feel my life fast <unk> . ” “ Wait a moment , ” said Monte Cristo .
He left the room , and returned in five minutes with a <unk> .
The dying man ’ s eyes were all the time <unk> on the door , through which he hoped <unk> would arrive .
“ <unk> , reverend sir , hasten !
I shall faint again ! ” Monte Cristo approached , and dropped on his purple lips three or four drops of the contents of the <unk> .
Caderousse drew a deep breath .
“ Oh , ” said he , “ that is life to me ; more , more ! ” “ Two drops more would kill you , ” replied the abbé .
“ Oh , send for someone to whom I can <unk> the wretch ! ” “ Shall I write your <unk> ?
You can sign it . ” “ Yes , yes , ” said Caderousse ; and his eyes <unk> at the thought of this <unk> revenge .
Monte Cristo wrote : “ I die , murdered by the Corsican Benedetto , my comrade in the galleys at Toulon , No .
<unk> . ” “ <unk> , quick ! ” said Caderousse , “ or I shall be unable to sign it . ” Monte Cristo gave the pen to Caderousse , who collected all his strength , signed it , and fell back on his bed , saying : “ You will relate all the rest , reverend sir ; you will say he calls himself Andrea Cavalcanti .
He <unk> at the Hôtel des <unk> .
Oh , I am dying ! ” He again fainted .
The abbé made him smell the contents of the <unk> , and he again opened his eyes .
His desire for revenge had not <unk> him .
“ Ah , you will tell all I have said , will you not , reverend sir ? ” “ Yes , and much more . ” “ What more will you say ? ” “ I will say he had doubtless given you the plan of this house , in the hope the count would kill you .
I will say , likewise , he had <unk> the count , by a note , of your intention , and , the count being absent , I read the note and sat up to await you . ” “ And he will be <unk> , will he not ? ” said Caderousse .
“ <unk> me that , and I will die with that hope . ” “ I will say , ” continued the count , “ that he followed and watched you the whole time , and when he saw you leave the house , ran to the angle of the wall to conceal himself . ” “ Did you see all that ? ” “ Remember my words : ‘ If you return home safely , I shall believe God has <unk> you , and I will forgive you also . ’ ” “ And you did not warn me ! ” cried Caderousse , raising himself on his elbows .
“ You knew I should be killed on leaving this house , and did not warn me ! ” <unk> “ No ; for I saw God ’ s justice placed in the hands of Benedetto , and should have thought it <unk> to oppose the <unk> of Providence . ” “ God ’ s justice !
Speak not of it , reverend sir .
If God were just , you know how many would be punished who now escape . ” “ <unk> , ” said the abbé , in a tone which made the dying man shudder ; “ have patience ! ” Caderousse looked at him with amazement .
“ Besides , ” said the abbé , “ God is <unk> to all , as he has been to you ; he is first a father , then a judge . ” “ Do you then believe in God ? ” said Caderousse .
“ Had I been so unhappy as not to believe in him until now , ” said Monte Cristo , “ I must believe on seeing you . ” Caderousse raised his clenched hands towards heaven .
“ Listen , ” said the abbé , extending his hand over the wounded man , as if to command him to believe ; “ this is what the God in whom , on your <unk> , you refuse to believe , has done for you — he gave you health , strength , regular employment , even friends — a life , in fact , which a man might enjoy with a calm conscience .
<unk> of <unk> these <unk> , rarely granted so <unk> , this has been your course — you have given yourself up to <unk> and <unk> , and in a fit of <unk> have ruined your best friend . ” “ <unk> ! ” cried Caderousse ; “ I require a <unk> , not a priest ; perhaps I am not <unk> wounded — I may not die ; perhaps they can yet save my life . ” “ Your wounds are so far mortal that , without the three drops I gave you , you would now be dead .
Listen , then . ” “ Ah , ” murmured Caderousse , “ what a strange priest you are ; you drive the dying to despair , instead of <unk> them . ” “ Listen , ” continued the abbé .
“ When you had betrayed your friend , God began not to strike , but to warn you .
<unk> <unk> you .
You had already passed half your life in <unk> that which you might have <unk> acquired ; and already you contemplated crime under the excuse of want , when God worked a miracle in your <unk> , sending you , by my hands , a fortune — brilliant , indeed , for you , who had never possessed any .
But this unexpected , <unk> , <unk> fortune sufficed you no longer when you once possessed it ; you wished to double it , and how ? — by a murder !
You succeeded , and then God <unk> it from you , and brought you to justice . ” “ It was not I who wished to kill the <unk> , ” said Caderousse ; “ it was La Carconte . ” “ Yes , ” said Monte Cristo , “ and God , — I cannot say in justice , for his justice would have <unk> you , — but God , in his mercy , spared your life . ” “ _ <unk> ! _ to <unk> me for life , how <unk> ! ” “ You thought it a mercy then , miserable wretch !
The coward who feared death rejoiced at <unk> disgrace ; for like all <unk> , you said , ‘ I may escape from prison , I cannot from the grave . ’ And you said truly ; the way was opened for you <unk> .
An Englishman visited Toulon , who had <unk> to <unk> two men from <unk> , and his choice fell on you and your companion .
You received a second fortune , money and tranquillity were restored to you , and you , who had been condemned to a <unk> ’ s life , might live as other men .
Then , wretched creature , then you tempted God a third time .
‘ I have not enough , ’ you said , when you had more than you before possessed , and you committed a third crime , without reason , without excuse .
God is <unk> ; he has punished you . ” Caderousse was fast sinking .
“ Give me drink , ” said he : “ I thirst — I burn ! ” Monte Cristo gave him a glass of water .
“ And yet that <unk> , Benedetto , will escape ! ” “ No one , I tell you , will escape ; Benedetto will be punished . ” “ Then , you , too , will be punished , for you did not do your duty as a priest — you should have prevented Benedetto from <unk> me . ” “ I ? ” said the count , with a smile which petrified the dying man , “ when you had just broken your knife against the coat of <unk> which protected my breast !
Yet perhaps if I had found you humble and <unk> , I might have prevented Benedetto from <unk> you ; but I found you proud and <unk> , and I left you in the hands of God . ” “ I do not believe there is a God , ” <unk> Caderousse ; “ you do not believe it ; you lie — you lie ! ” “ Silence , ” said the abbé ; “ you will force the last drop of blood from your veins .
What !
you do not believe in God when he is striking you dead ?
you will not believe in him , who requires but a prayer , a word , a tear , and he will forgive ?
God , who might have directed the assassin ’ s <unk> so as to end your career in a moment , has given you this quarter of an hour for <unk> .
<unk> , then , wretched man , and <unk> . ” “ No , ” said Caderousse , “ no ; I will not <unk> .
There is no God ; there is no Providence — all comes by chance . ” “ There is a Providence ; there is a God , ” said Monte Cristo , “ of whom you are a striking proof , as you lie in utter despair , <unk> him , while I stand before you , rich , happy , safe and <unk> that God in whom you endeavor not to believe , while in your heart you still believe in him . ” “ But who are you , then ? ” asked Caderousse , fixing his dying eyes on the count .
“ Look well at me ! ” said Monte Cristo , putting the light near his face .
“ Well , the abbé — the Abbé Busoni . ” Monte Cristo took off the <unk> which <unk> him , and let fall his black hair , which added so much to the beauty of his <unk> features .
“ Oh ? ” said Caderousse , <unk> , “ but for that black hair , I should say you were the Englishman , Lord Wilmore . ” “ I am neither the Abbé Busoni nor Lord Wilmore , ” said Monte Cristo ; “ think again , — do you not recollect me ? ” There was a <unk> effect in the count ’ s words , which once more <unk> the exhausted powers of the miserable man .
“ Yes , indeed , ” said he ; “ I think I have seen you and known you formerly . ” “ Yes , Caderousse , you have seen me ; you knew me once . ” “ Who , then , are you ?
and why , if you knew me , do you let me die ? ” “ Because nothing can save you ; your wounds are mortal .
Had it been possible to save you , I should have considered it another proof of God ’ s mercy , and I would again have endeavored to restore you , I swear by my father ’ s tomb . ” “ By your father ’ s tomb ! ” said Caderousse , supported by a <unk> power , and <unk> himself to see more distinctly the man who had just taken the oath which all men hold sacred ; “ who , then , are you ? ” The count had watched the approach of death .
He knew this was the last struggle .
He approached the dying man , and , leaning over him with a calm and melancholy look , he whispered , “ I am — I am — — ” And his almost closed lips uttered a name so low that the count himself appeared afraid to hear it .
Caderousse , who had raised himself on his knees , and stretched out his arm , tried to draw back , then <unk> his hands , and raising them with a desperate effort , “ Oh , my God , my God ! ” said he , “ pardon me for having denied thee ; thou <unk> exist , thou art indeed man ’ s father in heaven , and his judge on earth .
My God , my Lord , I have long <unk> thee !
Pardon me , my God ; receive me , Oh , my Lord ! ” Caderousse sighed deeply , and fell back with a groan .
The blood no longer flowed from his wounds .
He was dead .
“ _ One ! _ ” said the count <unk> , his eyes fixed on the corpse , <unk> by so awful a death .
Ten minutes afterwards the <unk> and the procureur arrived , the one accompanied by the porter , the other by Ali , and were received by the Abbé Busoni , who was praying by the side of the corpse .
Chapter <unk> .
Beauchamp The daring attempt to <unk> the count was the <unk> of conversation throughout Paris for the next fortnight .
The dying man had signed a <unk> <unk> Benedetto to be the assassin .
The police had orders to make the <unk> search for the murderer .
Caderousse ’ s knife , dark lantern , bunch of keys , and <unk> , excepting the waistcoat , which could not be found , were deposited at the <unk> ; the corpse was conveyed to the <unk> .
The count told everyone that this adventure had happened during his absence at Auteuil , and that he only knew what was related by the Abbé Busoni , who that evening , by mere chance , had requested to pass the night in his house , to examine some valuable books in his library .
Bertuccio alone turned pale whenever Benedetto ’ s name was mentioned in his presence , but there was no reason why anyone should notice his doing so .
Villefort , being called on to prove the crime , was preparing his brief with the same <unk> that he was accustomed to exercise when required to speak in criminal cases .
But three weeks had already passed , and the most <unk> search had been <unk> ; the attempted <unk> and the murder of the <unk> by his comrade were almost forgotten in <unk> of the approaching marriage of Mademoiselle Danglars to the Count Andrea Cavalcanti .
It was expected that this wedding would shortly take place , as the young man was received at the banker ’ s as the betrothed .
<unk> had been <unk> to M. Cavalcanti , as the count ’ s father , who highly approved of the union , regretted his <unk> to leave <unk> at that time , and promised a wedding gift of a hundred and fifty thousand livres .
It was agreed that the three millions should be <unk> to Danglars to <unk> ; some persons had warned the young man of the circumstances of his future <unk> , who had of late sustained repeated <unk> ; but with sublime <unk> and confidence the young man refused to listen , or to express a single doubt to the baron .
The baron adored Count Andrea Cavalcanti ; not so Mademoiselle Eugénie Danglars .
With an <unk> hatred of <unk> , she suffered Andrea ’ s attentions in order to get rid of Morcerf ; but when Andrea urged his suit , she betrayed an entire dislike to him .
The baron might possibly have perceived it , but , <unk> it to a <unk> , <unk> ignorance .
The delay demanded by Beauchamp had nearly <unk> .
Morcerf <unk> the advice of Monte Cristo to let things die away of their own accord .
No one had taken up the remark about the general , and no one had recognized in the officer who betrayed the castle of Yanina the noble count in the House of <unk> .
Albert , however , felt no less <unk> ; the few lines which had irritated him were certainly intended as an insult .
Besides , the manner in which Beauchamp had closed the <unk> left a bitter recollection in his heart .
He cherished the thought of the duel , hoping to conceal its true cause even from his seconds .
Beauchamp had not been seen since the day he visited Albert , and those of whom the latter inquired always told him he was out on a journey which would <unk> him some days .
Where he was no one knew .
One morning Albert was awakened by his valet de chambre , who announced Beauchamp .
Albert <unk> his eyes , ordered his servant to introduce him into the small <unk> on the ground floor , dressed himself quickly , and went down .
He found Beauchamp <unk> the room ; on perceiving him Beauchamp stopped .
“ Your arrival here , without waiting my visit at your house today , looks well , sir , ” said Albert .
“ Tell me , may I shake hands with you , saying , ‘ Beauchamp , acknowledge you have injured me , and retain my friendship , ’ or must I simply propose to you a choice of arms ? ” “ Albert , ” said Beauchamp , with a look of sorrow which stupefied the young man , “ let us first sit down and talk . ” “ <unk> , sir , before we sit down , I must demand your answer . ” “ Albert , ” said the <unk> , “ these are questions which it is difficult to answer . ” “ I will <unk> it by <unk> the question , ‘ Will you , or will you not , <unk> ? ’ ” “ Morcerf , it is not enough to answer ‘ yes ’ or ‘ no ’ to questions which concern the honor , the social interest , and the life of such a man as <unk> the Count of Morcerf , <unk> of France . ” “ What must then be done ? ” <unk> “ What I have done , Albert .
I <unk> thus — money , time , and fatigue are nothing compared with the reputation and interests of a whole family ; <unk> will not suffice , only facts will <unk> a deadly combat with a friend .
If I strike with the sword , or discharge the contents of a pistol at man with whom , for three years , I have been on terms of intimacy , I must , at least , know why I do so ; I must meet him with a heart at ease , and that quiet conscience which a man needs when his own arm must save his life . ” “ Well , ” said Morcerf , impatiently , “ what does all this mean ? ” “ It means that I have just returned from Yanina . ” “ From Yanina ? ” “ Yes . ” “ Impossible ! ” “ Here is my passport ; examine the <unk> — Geneva , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , Yanina .
Will you believe the government of a <unk> , a <unk> , and an <unk> ? ” Albert cast his eyes on the passport , then raised them in astonishment to Beauchamp .
“ You have been to Yanina ? ” said he .
“ Albert , had you been a stranger , a <unk> , a simple lord , like that Englishman who came to demand satisfaction three or four months since , and whom I killed to get rid of , I should not have taken this trouble ; but I thought this mark of consideration due to you .
I took a week to go , another to return , four days of <unk> , and <unk> hours to stay there ; that makes three weeks .
I returned last night , and here I am . ” “ What <unk> !
How long you are before you tell me what I most wish to know ? ” “ Because , in truth , Albert — — ” “ You hesitate ? ” “ Yes , — I fear . ” “ You fear to acknowledge that your correspondent has deceived you ?
Oh , no <unk> , Beauchamp .
<unk> it , Beauchamp ; your courage cannot be doubted . ” “ Not so , ” murmured the <unk> ; “ on the contrary — — ” Albert turned <unk> pale ; he endeavored to speak , but the words died on his lips .
“ My friend , ” said Beauchamp , in the most affectionate tone , “ I should <unk> make an <unk> ; but , alas ! — — ” “ But what ? ” “ The paragraph was correct , my friend . ” “ What ?
That French officer — — ” “ Yes . ” “ Fernand ? ” “ Yes . ” “ The <unk> who <unk> the castle of the man in whose service he was — — ” “ Pardon me , my friend , that man was your father ! ” Albert advanced <unk> towards Beauchamp , but the latter restrained him more by a <unk> look than by his extended hand .
“ My friend , ” said he , “ here is a proof of it . ” <unk> Albert opened the paper , it was an <unk> of four <unk> inhabitants of Yanina , <unk> that Colonel Fernand <unk> , in the service of Ali <unk> , had <unk> the castle for two million crowns .
The <unk> were perfectly legal .
Albert <unk> and fell <unk> in a chair .
It could no longer be doubted ; the family name was fully given .
After a moment ’ s mournful silence , his heart <unk> , and he gave way to a <unk> of tears .
Beauchamp , who had watched with sincere pity the young man ’ s <unk> of grief , approached him .
“ Now , Albert , ” said he , “ you understand me — do you not ?
I wished to see all , and to judge of everything for myself , hoping the explanation would be in your father ’ s favor , and that I might do him justice .
But , on the contrary , the particulars which are given prove that Fernand <unk> , raised by Ali <unk> to the rank of <unk> , is no other than Count Fernand of Morcerf ; then , <unk> the honor you had done me , in <unk> me to your friendship , I hastened to you . ” Albert , still extended on the chair , covered his face with both hands , as if to prevent the light from reaching him .
“ I hastened to you , ” continued Beauchamp , “ to tell you , Albert , that in this changing age , the faults of a father cannot <unk> upon his children .
<unk> have passed through this revolutionary period , in the midst of which we were born , without some <unk> of <unk> or blood to soil the uniform of the soldier , or the gown of the magistrate .
Now I have these proofs , Albert , and I am in your confidence , no human power can force me to a duel which your own conscience would reproach you with as criminal , but I come to offer you what you can no longer demand of me .
Do you wish these proofs , these <unk> , which I alone possess , to be destroyed ?
Do you wish this frightful secret to remain with us ?
<unk> to me , it shall never escape my lips ; say , Albert , my friend , do you wish it ? ” Albert threw himself on Beauchamp ’ s neck .
“ Ah , noble fellow ! ” cried he .
“ Take these , ” said Beauchamp , presenting the papers to Albert .
Albert seized them with a <unk> hand , tore them in pieces , and trembling lest the least <unk> should escape and one day appear to <unk> him , he approached the <unk> , always kept burning for <unk> , and burned every fragment .
“ Dear , excellent friend , ” murmured Albert , still burning the papers .
“ Let all be forgotten as a sorrowful dream , ” said Beauchamp ; “ let it vanish as the last <unk> from the <unk> paper , and disappear as the smoke from those silent ashes . ” “ Yes , yes , ” said Albert , “ and may there remain only the eternal friendship which I promised to my <unk> , which shall be <unk> to our children ’ s children , and shall always remind me that I owe my life and the honor of my name to you , — for had this been known , oh , Beauchamp , I should have destroyed myself ; or , — no , my poor mother !
I could not have killed her by the same blow , — I should have fled from my country . ” “ Dear Albert , ” said Beauchamp .
But this sudden and <unk> joy soon <unk> the young man , and was succeeded by a still greater grief .
“ Well , ” said Beauchamp , “ what still <unk> you , my friend ? ” <unk> “ I am <unk> , ” said Albert .
“ Listen , Beauchamp !
I cannot thus , in a moment <unk> the respect , the confidence , and pride with which a father ’ s <unk> name <unk> a son .
Oh , Beauchamp , Beauchamp , how shall I now approach mine ?
Shall I draw back my forehead from his embrace , or <unk> my hand from his ?
I am the most wretched of men .
Ah , my mother , my poor mother ! ” said Albert , gazing through his tears at his mother ’ s portrait ; “ if you know this , how much must you suffer ! ” “ Come , ” said Beauchamp , taking both his hands , “ take courage , my friend . ” “ But how came that first note to be <unk> in your journal ?
Some unknown enemy — an invisible <unk> — has done this . ” “ The more must you <unk> yourself , Albert .
Let no trace of emotion be visible on your countenance , bear your grief as the cloud bears within it ruin and death — a fatal secret , known only when the storm <unk> .
Go , my friend , reserve your strength for the moment when the <unk> shall come . ” <unk> “ You think , then , all is not over yet ? ” said Albert , <unk> .
“ I think nothing , my friend ; but all things are possible .
By the way — — ” “ What ? ” said Albert , seeing that Beauchamp hesitated .
“ Are you going to marry Mademoiselle Danglars ? ” “ Why do you ask me now ? ” “ Because the <unk> or <unk> of this engagement is connected with the person of whom we were speaking . ” “ How ? ” said Albert , whose brow <unk> ; “ you think M. Danglars — — ” “ I ask you only how your engagement stands ?
Pray put no construction on my words I do not mean they should convey , and give them no <unk> weight . ” “ No . ” said Albert , “ the engagement is broken off . ” “ Well , ” said Beauchamp .
Then , seeing the young man was about to <unk> into melancholy , “ Let us go out , Albert , ” said he ; “ a ride in the wood in the <unk> , or on horseback , will <unk> you ; we will then return to breakfast , and you shall attend to your affairs , and I to mine . ” “ <unk> , ” said Albert ; “ but let us walk .
I think a little exertion would do me good . ” The two friends walked out on the <unk> .
When they arrived at the Madeleine : “ Since we are out , ” said Beauchamp , “ let us call on M. de Monte Cristo ; he is admirably <unk> to <unk> one ’ s spirits , because he never <unk> , and in my opinion those who ask no questions are the best <unk> . ” “ <unk> , ” said Albert ; “ let us call — I love him . ” Chapter <unk> .
The <unk> Monte Cristo uttered a <unk> exclamation on seeing the young men together .
“ Ah , <unk> ! ” said he , “ I hope all is over , explained and settled . ” “ Yes , ” said Beauchamp ; “ the absurd reports have died away , and should they be renewed , I would be the first to oppose them ; so let us speak no more of it . ” “ Albert will tell you , ” replied the count “ that I gave him the same advice .
Look , ” added he .
“ I am <unk> the most <unk> morning ’ s work . ” “ What is it ? ” said Albert ; “ arranging your papers , apparently . ” “ My papers , thank God , no , — my papers are all in capital order , because I have none ; but M. Cavalcanti ’ s . ” “ M.
Cavalcanti ’ s ? ” asked Beauchamp .
“ Yes ; do you not know that this is a young man whom the count is <unk> ? ” said Morcerf .
“ Let us not <unk> each other , ” replied Monte Cristo ; “ I introduce no one , and certainly not M. Cavalcanti . ” “ And who , ” said Albert with a forced smile , “ is to marry Mademoiselle Danglars instead of me , which <unk> me <unk> . ” “ What ?
Cavalcanti is going to marry Mademoiselle Danglars ? ” asked Beauchamp .
“ Certainly !
do you come from the end of the world ? ” said Monte Cristo ; “ you , a <unk> , the husband of <unk> ?
It is the talk of all Paris . ” “ And you , count , have made this match ? ” asked Beauchamp .
“ I ?
Silence , <unk> of <unk> , do not spread that report .
I make a match ?
No , you do not know me ; I have done all in my power to oppose it . ” “ Ah , I understand , ” said Beauchamp , “ on our friend Albert ’ s account . ” “ On my account ? ” said the young man ; “ oh , no , indeed , the count will do me the justice to <unk> that I have , on the contrary , always <unk> him to break off my engagement , and happily it is ended .
The count <unk> I have not him to thank ; — so be it — I will erect an altar _ <unk> <unk> _ . ” “ Listen , ” said Monte Cristo ; “ I have had little to do with it , for I am at <unk> both with the <unk> and the young man ; there is only Mademoiselle Eugénie , who appears but little <unk> with the thoughts of <unk> , and who , seeing how little I was disposed to persuade her to <unk> her dear liberty , <unk> any affection for me . ” “ And do you say this wedding is at hand ? ” “ Oh , yes , in spite of all I could say .
I do not know the young man ; he is said to be of good family and rich , but I never trust to vague <unk> .
I have warned M. Danglars of it till I am tired , but he is <unk> with his <unk> .
I have even informed him of a circumstance I consider very serious ; the young man was either <unk> by his nurse , stolen by <unk> , or lost by his <unk> , I scarcely know which .
But I do know his father lost sight of him for more than ten years ; what he did during these ten years , God only knows .
Well , all that was useless .
They have <unk> me to write to the major to demand papers , and here they are .
I send them , but like <unk> — <unk> my hands . ” “ And what does Mademoiselle d ’ <unk> say to you for <unk> her of her <unk> ? ” “ Oh , well , I don ’ t know ; but I understand that she is going to Italy .
Madame Danglars asked me for letters of <unk> for the _ <unk> _ ; I gave her a few lines for the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , who is under some <unk> to me .
But what is the matter , Albert ?
you look dull ; are you , after all , unconsciously in love with Mademoiselle Eugénie ? ” “ I am not aware of it , ” said Albert , smiling <unk> .
Beauchamp turned to look at some <unk> .
“ But , ” continued Monte Cristo , “ you are not in your usual spirits ? ” “ I have a dreadful <unk> , ” said Albert .
“ Well , my dear viscount , ” said Monte Cristo , “ I have an <unk> remedy to propose to you . ” “ What is that ? ” asked the young man .
“ A change . ” “ Indeed ? ” said Albert .
“ Yes ; and as I am just now excessively <unk> , I shall go from home .
Shall we go together ? ” “ You <unk> , count ? ” said Beauchamp ; “ and by what ? ” “ Ah , you think very lightly of it ; I should like to see you with a brief preparing in your house . ” “ What brief ? ” “ The one M. de Villefort is preparing against my amiable assassin — some <unk> escaped from the <unk> apparently . ” “ True , ” said Beauchamp ; “ I saw it in the paper .
Who is this Caderousse ? ” “ Some <unk> , it appears .
M. de Villefort heard of him at Marseilles , and M. Danglars <unk> having seen him .
<unk> , the procureur is very active in the affair , and the prefect of police very much interested ; and , thanks to that interest , for which I am very grateful , they send me all the <unk> of Paris and the neighborhood , under <unk> of their being Caderousse ’ s <unk> , so that in three months , if this <unk> , every <unk> and assassin in France will have the plan of my house at his fingers ’ ends .
I am resolved to desert them and go to some <unk> corner of the earth , and shall be happy if you will accompany me , viscount . ” “ <unk> . ” “ Then it is settled ? ” “ Yes , but where ? ” “ I have told you , where the air is pure , where every sound <unk> , where one is sure to be <unk> , however proud may be his nature .
I love that <unk> , I , who am master of the universe , as was <unk> . ” “ But where are you really going ? ” “ To sea , viscount ; you know I am a sailor .
I was <unk> when an infant in the arms of old <unk> , and on the bosom of the beautiful <unk> ; I have <unk> with the green mantle of the one and the azure <unk> of the other ; I love the sea as a mistress , and <unk> if I do not often see her . ” “ Let us go , count . ” “ To sea ? ” “ Yes . ” “ You accept my proposal ? ” “ I do . ” “ Well , viscount , there will be in my courtyard this evening a good travelling <unk> , with four <unk> , in which one may rest as in a bed .
M. Beauchamp , it holds four very well , will you accompany us ? ” “ Thank you , I have just returned from sea . ” “ What ?
you have been to sea ? ” “ Yes ; I have just made a little <unk> to the <unk> <unk> . ” “ What of that ?
come with us , ” said Albert .
“ No , dear Morcerf ; you know I only refuse when the thing is impossible .
Besides , it is important , ” added he in a low tone , “ that I should remain in Paris just now to watch the paper . ” “ Ah , you are a good and an excellent friend , ” said Albert ; “ yes , you are right ; watch , watch , Beauchamp , and try to discover the enemy who made this <unk> . ” Albert and Beauchamp parted , the last pressure of their hands expressing what their <unk> could not before a stranger .
“ Beauchamp is a worthy fellow , ” said Monte Cristo , when the <unk> was gone ; “ is he not , Albert ? ” “ Yes , and a sincere friend ; I love him <unk> .
But now we are alone , — although it is <unk> to me , — where are we going ? ” “ <unk> <unk> , if you like . ” “ <unk> ; shall we be quite retired ?
have no society , no neighbors ? ” “ Our companions will be <unk> , dogs to <unk> with , and a <unk> . ” “ Exactly what I wish for ; I will <unk> my mother of my intention , and return to you . ” “ But shall you be allowed to go into <unk> ? ” “ I may go where I please . ” “ Yes , I am aware you may go alone , since I once met you in Italy — but to accompany the mysterious Monte Cristo ? ” “ You forget , count , that I have often told you of the deep interest my mother takes in you . ” “ ‘ <unk> is <unk> . ’ said <unk> I. ; ‘ woman is like a wave of the sea , ’ said <unk> ; both the great king and the great poet ought to have known woman ’ s nature well . ” “ <unk> ’ s , yes ; my mother is not woman , but _ a _ woman . ” “ As I am only a humble <unk> , you must pardon me if I do not understand all the <unk> <unk> of your language . ” “ What I mean to say is , that my mother is not quick to give her confidence , but when she does she never changes . ” “ Ah , yes , indeed , ” said Monte Cristo with a sigh ; “ and do you think she is in the least interested in me ? ” “ I repeat it , you must really be a very strange and superior man , for my mother is so absorbed by the interest you have excited , that when I am with her she speaks of no one else . ” “ And does she try to make you dislike me ? ” “ On the contrary , she often says , ‘ Morcerf , I believe the count has a noble nature ; try to gain his esteem . ’ ” “ Indeed ? ” said Monte Cristo , <unk> .
“ You see , then , ” said Albert , “ that instead of <unk> , she will <unk> me . ” “ Adieu , then , until five o ’ clock ; be <unk> , and we shall arrive at twelve or one . ” “ At <unk> ? ” “ Yes ; or in the neighborhood . ” “ But can we travel <unk> leagues in eight hours ? ” “ <unk> , ” said Monte Cristo .
“ You are certainly a <unk> ; you will soon not only <unk> the <unk> , which would not be very difficult in France , but even the telegraph . ” “ But , viscount , since we cannot perform the journey in less than seven or eight hours , do not keep me waiting . ” “ Do not fear , I have little to prepare . ” Monte Cristo smiled as he nodded to Albert , then remained a moment absorbed in deep meditation .
But passing his hand across his forehead as if to <unk> his reverie , he rang the bell twice and Bertuccio entered .
“ Bertuccio , ” said he , “ I intend going this evening to <unk> , instead of tomorrow or the next day .
You will have sufficient time before five o ’ clock ; <unk> a messenger to <unk> the <unk> at the first station .
M. de Morcerf will accompany me . ” Bertuccio obeyed and <unk> a <unk> to <unk> to say the <unk> would arrive at six o ’ clock .
From <unk> another express was sent to the next stage , and in six hours all the horses stationed on the road were ready .
Before his departure , the count went to Haydée ’ s apartments , told her his intention , and resigned everything to her care .
Albert was <unk> .
The journey soon became interesting from its rapidity , of which Morcerf had formed no previous idea .
“ <unk> , ” said Monte Cristo , “ with your <unk> going at the rate of two leagues an hour , and that absurd law that one traveller shall not pass another without permission , so that an invalid or <unk> traveller may <unk> those who are well and active , it is impossible to move ; I escape this <unk> by travelling with my own <unk> and horses ; do I not , Ali ? ” The count put his head out of the window and <unk> , and the horses appeared to fly .
The carriage rolled with a <unk> noise over the pavement , and everyone turned to notice the dazzling <unk> .
Ali , smiling , repeated the sound , grasped the <unk> with a firm hand , and <unk> his horses , whose beautiful <unk> <unk> in the breeze .
This child of the desert was in his element , and with his black face and sparkling eyes appeared , in the cloud of dust he raised , like the genius of the <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> .
“ I never knew till now the delight of speed , ” said Morcerf , and the last cloud disappeared from his brow ; “ but where the devil do you get such horses ?
Are they made to order ? ” “ <unk> , ” said the count ; “ six years since I bought a horse in <unk> remarkable for its <unk> .
The <unk> that we shall use tonight are its <unk> ; they are all entirely black , with the exception of a star upon the forehead . ” “ That is perfectly admirable ; but what do you do , count , with all these horses ? ” “ You see , I travel with them . ” “ But you are not always travelling . ” “ When I no longer require them , Bertuccio will sell them , and he <unk> to realize thirty or forty thousand francs by the <unk> . ” “ But no <unk> in Europe will be wealthy enough to purchase them . ” “ Then he will sell them to some <unk> <unk> , who will empty his <unk> to purchase them , and <unk> them by <unk> the <unk> to his subjects . ” “ Count , may I <unk> one idea to you ? ” “ Certainly . ” “ It is that , next to you , Bertuccio must be the <unk> gentleman in Europe . ” “ You are mistaken , viscount ; I believe he has not a <unk> in his possession . ” “ Then he must be a wonder .
My dear count , if you tell me many more marvellous things , I warn you I shall not believe them . ” “ I countenance nothing that is marvellous , M. Albert .
Tell me , why does a steward <unk> his master ? ” “ Because , I suppose , it is his nature to do so , for the love of <unk> . ” “ You are mistaken ; it is because he has a wife and family , and <unk> desires for himself and them .
<unk> because he is not sure of always <unk> his situation , and wishes to provide for the future .
Now , M. Bertuccio is alone in the world ; he <unk> my property without <unk> for the use he makes of it ; he is sure never to leave my service . ” “ Why ? ” “ Because I should never get a better . ” “ <unk> are <unk> . ” “ But I deal in <unk> ; he is the best servant over whom one has the power of life and death . ” “ Do you possess that right over Bertuccio ? ” “ Yes . ” There are words which close a conversation with an iron door ; such was the count ’ s “ yes . ” The whole journey was performed with equal rapidity ; the <unk> horses , <unk> over seven <unk> , brought them to their <unk> in eight hours .
At midnight they arrived at the gate of a beautiful <unk> .
The porter was in <unk> ; he had been <unk> by the <unk> of the last stage of the count ’ s approach .
At half past two in the morning Morcerf was conducted to his apartments , where a <unk> and supper were prepared .
The servant who had travelled at the back of the carriage waited on him ; Baptistin , who <unk> in front , attended the count .
Albert bathed , took his supper , and went to bed .
All night he was <unk> by the melancholy noise of the <unk> .
On rising , he went to his window , which opened on a <unk> , having the sea in front , and at the back a pretty <unk> bounded by a small forest .
In a <unk> lay a little <unk> , with a narrow <unk> and high <unk> , bearing on its flag the Monte Cristo arms which were a mountain _ or _ , on a sea _ azure _ , with a cross _ <unk> _ in chief which might be an allusion to his name that recalled <unk> , the <unk> rendered by our Lord ’ s passion more precious than gold , and to the <unk> cross which his blood had rendered holy ; or it might be some personal remembrance of suffering and <unk> buried in the night of this mysterious personage ’ s past life .
<unk> the <unk> lay a number of small <unk> belonging to the <unk> of the neighboring village , like humble subjects awaiting orders from their <unk> .
There , as in every spot where Monte Cristo stopped , if but for two days , luxury <unk> and life went on with the utmost ease .
Albert found in his <unk> two guns , with all the <unk> for <unk> ; a lofty room on the ground floor containing all the ingenious instruments the English — <unk> in <unk> <unk> , since they are patient and <unk> — have invented for <unk> .
The day passed in pursuing those <unk> in which Monte Cristo <unk> .
They killed a dozen <unk> in the <unk> , as many <unk> in the stream , dined in a <unk> <unk> the ocean , and took tea in the library .
Towards the evening of the third day .
Albert , completely exhausted with the exercise which <unk> Monte Cristo , was sleeping in an armchair near the window , while the count was <unk> with his <unk> the plan of a <unk> in his house , when the sound of a horse at full speed on the high road made Albert look up .
He was <unk> surprised to see his own valet de chambre , whom he had not brought , that he might not inconvenience Monte Cristo .
<unk> “ <unk> here ! ” cried he , starting up ; “ is my mother ill ? ” And he hastened to the door .
Monte Cristo watched and saw him approach the valet , who drew a small sealed <unk> from his pocket , containing a <unk> and a letter .
“ From whom is this ? ” said he eagerly .
“ From M. Beauchamp , ” replied <unk> .
“ Did he send you ? ” “ Yes , sir ; he sent for me to his house , gave me money for my journey , procured a horse , and made me promise not to stop till I had reached you , I have come in fifteen hours . ” Albert opened the letter with fear , uttered a <unk> on reading the first line , and seized the paper .
His sight was <unk> , his legs sank under him , and he would have fallen had not <unk> supported him .
“ Poor young man , ” said Monte Cristo in a low voice ; “ it is then true that the sin of the father shall fall on the children to the third and fourth <unk> . ” Meanwhile Albert had <unk> , and , <unk> to read , he threw back his head , saying : “ <unk> , is your horse fit to return immediately ? ” “ It is a poor , <unk> <unk> . ” “ In what state was the house when you left ? ” “ All was quiet , but on returning from M. Beauchamp ’ s , I found madame in tears ; she had sent for me to know when you would return .
I told her my orders from M. Beauchamp ; she first extended her arms to prevent me , but after a moment ’ s reflection , ‘ Yes , go , <unk> , ’ said she , ‘ and may he come quickly . ’ ” “ Yes , my mother , ” said Albert , “ I will return , and <unk> to the infamous wretch !
But first of all I must get there . ” He went back to the room where he had left Monte Cristo .
Five minutes had sufficed to make a complete <unk> in his appearance .
His voice had become rough and hoarse ; his face was <unk> with <unk> ; his eyes burned under the <unk> <unk> , and he <unk> like a <unk> man .
“ Count , ” said he , “ I thank you for your hospitality , which I would <unk> have enjoyed longer ; but I must return to Paris . ” “ What has happened ? ” “ A great misfortune , more important to me than life .
Don ’ t question me , I beg of you , but lend me a horse . ” “ My <unk> are at your command , viscount ; but you will kill yourself by <unk> on horseback .
Take a <unk> or a carriage . ” “ No , it would delay me , and I need the fatigue you warn me of ; it will do me good . ” Albert <unk> as if he had been shot , and fell on a chair near the door .
Monte Cristo did not see this second <unk> of physical <unk> ; he was at the window , calling : “ Ali , a horse for M. de Morcerf — quick !
he is in a hurry ! ” <unk> These words restored Albert ; he darted from the room , followed by the count .
“ Thank you ! ” cried he , throwing himself on his horse .
“ <unk> as soon as you can , <unk> .
<unk> I use any <unk> to procure a horse ? ” “ Only <unk> ; another will be immediately <unk> . ” Albert hesitated a moment .
“ You may think my departure strange and foolish , ” said the young man ; “ you do not know how a paragraph in a <unk> may <unk> one .
<unk> that , ” said he , “ when I am gone , that you may not be witness of my anger . ” While the count picked up the paper he put <unk> to his horse , which leaped in astonishment at such an unusual <unk> , and shot away with the rapidity of an <unk> .
The count watched him with a feeling of compassion , and when he had completely disappeared , read as follows : “ The French officer in the service of Ali <unk> of Yanina <unk> to three weeks since in _ l ’ <unk> _ , who not only <unk> the castle of Yanina , but sold his benefactor to the <unk> , <unk> himself truly at that time Fernand , as our <unk> <unk> states ; but he has since added to his Christian name a title of nobility and a family name .
He now calls himself the Count of Morcerf , and ranks among the <unk> . ” Thus the terrible secret , which Beauchamp had so <unk> destroyed , appeared again like an armed phantom ; and another paper , <unk> its information from some malicious source , had <unk> two days after Albert ’ s departure for <unk> the few lines which had rendered the unfortunate young man almost <unk> .
Chapter <unk> .
The <unk> At eight o ’ clock in the morning Albert had arrived at Beauchamp ’ s door .
The valet de chambre had received orders to <unk> him in at once .
Beauchamp was in his <unk> .
“ Here I am , ” Albert said .
“ Well , my poor friend , ” replied Beauchamp , “ I expected you . ” “ I need not say I think you are too faithful and too kind to have spoken of that painful circumstance .
Your having sent for me is another proof of your affection .
So , without losing time , tell me , have you the slightest idea whence this terrible blow <unk> ? ” “ I think I have some <unk> . ” “ But first tell me all the particulars of this <unk> plot . ” Beauchamp proceeded to relate to the young man , who was overwhelmed with shame and grief , the following facts .
Two days previously , the article had appeared in another paper besides _ l ’ <unk> _ , and , what was more serious , one that was well known as a government paper .
Beauchamp was <unk> when he read the paragraph .
He sent immediately for a cabriolet , and hastened to the <unk> ’ s office .
Although <unk> <unk> opposite principles from those of the <unk> of the other paper , Beauchamp — as it sometimes , we may say often , happens — was his intimate friend .
The <unk> was reading , with apparent delight , a leading article in the same paper on <unk> , probably a <unk> of his own .
“ Ah , _ <unk> ! _ ” said Beauchamp , “ with the paper in your hand , my friend , I need not tell you the cause of my visit . ” “ Are you interested in the <unk> question ? ” asked the <unk> of the <unk> paper .
“ No , ” replied Beauchamp , “ I have not considered the question ; a totally different subject interests me . ” “ What is it ? ” “ The article relative to Morcerf . ” “ Indeed ?
Is it not a curious affair ? ” “ So curious , that I think you are running a great risk of a <unk> for <unk> of character . ” “ Not at all ; we have received with the information all the requisite proofs , and we are quite sure M. de Morcerf will not raise his voice against us ; besides , it is <unk> a service to one ’ s country to <unk> these wretched <unk> who are unworthy of the honor bestowed on them . ” Beauchamp was <unk> .
“ Who , then , has so <unk> informed you ? ” asked he ; “ for my paper , which gave the first information on the subject , has been obliged to stop for want of proof ; and yet we are more interested than you in <unk> M. de Morcerf , as he is a <unk> of France , and we are of the opposition . ” “ Oh , that is very simple ; we have not sought to <unk> .
This news was brought to us .
A man arrived yesterday from Yanina , bringing a formidable <unk> of documents ; and when we hesitated to <unk> the <unk> article , he told us it should be <unk> in some other paper . ” Beauchamp understood that nothing remained but to submit , and left the office to <unk> a <unk> to Morcerf .
But he had been unable to send to Albert the following particulars , as the events had <unk> after the messenger ’ s departure ; <unk> , that the same day a great agitation was <unk> in the House of <unk> among the usually calm members of that <unk> assembly .
<unk> had arrived almost before the usual hour , and was conversing on the melancholy event which was to attract the attention of the public towards one of their most illustrious <unk> .
Some were <unk> the article , others making <unk> and <unk> circumstances which <unk> the <unk> still more .
The Count of Morcerf was no favorite with his <unk> .
Like all <unk> , he had had <unk> to a great deal of <unk> to <unk> his position .
The true nobility laughed at him , the <unk> <unk> him , and the honorable instinctively <unk> him .
He was , in fact , in the unhappy position of the victim marked for sacrifice ; the finger of God once pointed at him , everyone was prepared to raise the hue and cry .
The Count of Morcerf alone was ignorant of the news .
He did not take in the paper containing the <unk> article , and had passed the morning in writing letters and in trying a horse .
He arrived at his usual hour , with a proud look and <unk> <unk> ; he <unk> , passed through the <unk> , and entered the house without observing the hesitation of the <unk> or the coolness of his <unk> .
<unk> <unk> had already been going on for half an hour when he entered .
<unk> held the <unk> paper , but , as usual , no one liked to take upon himself the <unk> of the attack .
At length an honorable <unk> , Morcerf ’ s acknowledged enemy , ascended the <unk> with that solemnity which announced that the expected moment had arrived .
There was an <unk> silence ; Morcerf alone knew not why such profound attention was given to an <unk> who was not always listened to with so much <unk> .
The count did not notice the introduction , in which the <unk> announced that his communication would be of that <unk> importance that it demanded the <unk> attention of the House ; but at the mention of Yanina and Colonel Fernand , he turned so <unk> pale that every member shuddered and fixed his eyes upon him .
<unk> wounds have this peculiarity , — they may be hidden , but they never close ; always painful , always ready to <unk> when touched , they remain fresh and open in the heart .
The article having been read during the painful <unk> that followed , a universal shudder <unk> the assembly , and immediately the <unk> attention was given to the <unk> as he resumed his remarks .
He stated his scruples and the difficulties of the case ; it was the honor of M. de Morcerf , and that of the whole House , he proposed to defend , by <unk> a <unk> on personal questions , which are always such painful <unk> of discussion .
He concluded by calling for an <unk> , which might <unk> of the <unk> report before it had time to spread , and restore M. de Morcerf to the position he had long held in public opinion .
Morcerf was so completely overwhelmed by this great and unexpected <unk> that he could scarcely <unk> a few words as he looked around on the assembly .
This <unk> , which might proceed from the astonishment of innocence as well as the shame of guilt , <unk> some in his favor ; for men who are truly generous are always ready to <unk> when the misfortune of their enemy <unk> the <unk> of their hatred .
The president put it to the <unk> , and it was decided that the <unk> should take place .
The count was asked what time he required to prepare his defence .
Morcerf ’ s courage had <unk> when he found himself alive after this horrible blow .
“ My <unk> , ” answered he , “ it is not by time I could <unk> the attack made on me by enemies unknown to me , and , doubtless , hidden in obscurity ; it is immediately , and by a <unk> , that I must <unk> the flash of lightning which , for a moment , startled me .
Oh , that I could , instead of taking up this defence , shed my last drop of blood to prove to my noble <unk> that I am their equal in worth . ” These words made a favorable impression on <unk> of the accused .
“ I demand , then , that the examination shall take place as soon as possible , and I will furnish the house with all necessary information . ” “ What day do you fix ? ” asked the president .
“ <unk> I am at your service , ” replied the count .
The president rang the bell .
“ Does the House approve that the examination should take place today ? ” <unk> “ Yes , ” was the <unk> answer .
A <unk> of twelve members was chosen to examine the proofs brought forward by Morcerf .
The <unk> would begin at eight o ’ clock that evening in the <unk> , and if <unk> were necessary , the <unk> would be resumed each evening at the same hour .
Morcerf asked leave to retire ; he had to collect the documents he had long been preparing against this storm , which his <unk> had <unk> .
Beauchamp related to the young man all the facts we have just <unk> ; his story , however , had over ours all the advantage of the animation of living things over the <unk> of dead things .
Albert listened , trembling now with hope , then with anger , and then again with shame , for from Beauchamp ’ s confidence he knew his father was guilty , and he asked himself how , since he was guilty , he could prove his innocence .
Beauchamp hesitated to continue his <unk> .
“ What next ? ” asked Albert .
“ What next ?
My friend , you <unk> a painful task on me .
<unk> you know all ? ” “ <unk> ; and rather from your lips than another ’ s . ” “ <unk> up all your courage , then , for never have you required it more . ” Albert passed his hand over his forehead , as if to try his strength , as a man who is preparing to defend his life <unk> his <unk> and <unk> his sword .
He thought himself strong enough , for he <unk> fever for energy .
“ Go on , ” said he .
“ The evening arrived ; all Paris was in expectation .
Many said your father had only to show himself to crush the charge against him ; many others said he would not appear ; while some <unk> that they had seen him start for <unk> ; and others went to the <unk> to inquire if he had taken out a passport .
I used all my influence with one of the <unk> , a young <unk> of my acquaintance , to get <unk> to one of the <unk> .
He called for me at seven o ’ clock , and , before anyone had arrived , asked one of the <unk> to place me in a box .
I was concealed by a column , and might witness the whole of the terrible scene which was about to take place .
At eight o ’ clock all were in their places , and M. de Morcerf entered at the last stroke .
He held some papers in his hand ; his countenance was calm , and his step firm , and he was dressed with great care in his military uniform , which was <unk> completely up to the chin .
His presence produced a good effect .
The <unk> was made up of <unk> , several of whom came forward to shake hands with him . ” Albert felt his heart <unk> at these particulars , but gratitude mingled with his sorrow : he would <unk> have embraced those who had given his father this proof of esteem at a moment when his honor was so <unk> attacked .
“ At this moment one of the <unk> brought in a letter for the president .
‘ You are at liberty to speak , M. de Morcerf , ’ said the president , as he <unk> the letter ; and the count began his defence , I assure you , Albert , in a most <unk> and skilful manner .
He produced documents <unk> that the <unk> of Yanina had up to the last moment <unk> him with his entire confidence , since he had interested him with a <unk> of life and death with the emperor .
He produced the ring , his mark of authority , with which Ali <unk> generally sealed his letters , and which the latter had given him , that he might , on his return at any hour of the day or night , gain access to the presence , even in the <unk> .
<unk> , the <unk> failed , and when he returned to defend his benefactor , he was dead .
‘ But , ’ said the count , ‘ so great was Ali <unk> ’ s confidence , that on his <unk> he resigned his favorite mistress and her daughter to my care . ’ ” Albert started on hearing these words ; the history of Haydée recurred to him , and he remembered what she had said of that message and the ring , and the manner in which she had been sold and made a slave .
“ And what effect did this <unk> produce ? ” anxiously inquired Albert .
“ I acknowledge it affected me , and , indeed , all the <unk> also , ” said Beauchamp .
“ Meanwhile , the president <unk> opened the letter which had been brought to him ; but the first lines aroused his attention ; he read them again and again , and fixing his eyes on M. de Morcerf , ‘ Count , ’ said he , ‘ you have said that the <unk> of Yanina <unk> his wife and daughter to your care ? ’ — ‘ Yes , sir , ’ replied Morcerf ; ‘ but in that , like all the rest , misfortune pursued me .
On my return , <unk> and her daughter Haydée had disappeared . ’ — ‘ Did you know them ? ’ — ‘ My intimacy with the <unk> and his <unk> confidence had gained me an introduction to them , and I had seen them above twenty times . ’ “ ‘ Have you any idea what became of them ? ’ — ‘ Yes , sir ; I heard they had fallen <unk> to their sorrow , and , perhaps , to their poverty .
I was not rich ; my life was in constant danger ; I could not seek them , to my great regret . ’ The president <unk> <unk> .
‘ Gentlemen , ’ said he , ‘ you have heard the Comte de Morcerf ’ s defence .
Can you , sir , produce any witnesses to the truth of what you have <unk> ? ’ — ‘ Alas , no , monsieur , ’ replied the count ; ‘ all those who surrounded the <unk> , or who knew me at his court , are either dead or gone away , I know not where .
I believe that I alone , of all my <unk> , <unk> that dreadful war .
I have only the letters of Ali <unk> , which I have placed before you ; the ring , a <unk> of his <unk> , which is here ; and , <unk> , the most <unk> proof I can offer , after an <unk> attack , and that is the absence of any witness against my <unk> and the purity of my military life . ’ “ A murmur of approbation ran through the assembly ; and at this moment , Albert , had nothing more <unk> , your father ’ s cause had been gained .
It only remained to put it to the <unk> , when the president resumed : ‘ Gentlemen and you , monsieur , — you will not be displeased , I presume , to listen to one who calls himself a very important witness , and who has just presented himself .
He is , doubtless , come to prove the perfect innocence of our <unk> .
Here is a letter I have just received on the subject ; shall it be read , or shall it be passed over ?
and shall we take no notice of this incident ? ’ M. de Morcerf turned pale , and clenched his hands on the papers he held .
The <unk> decided to hear the letter ; the count was thoughtful and silent .
The president read : “ ‘ Mr.
President , — I can furnish the <unk> of inquiry into the conduct of the <unk> the Count of Morcerf in <unk> and in <unk> with important particulars . ’ “ The president paused , and the count turned pale .
The president looked at his <unk> .
‘ <unk> , ’ was heard on all sides .
The president resumed : “ ‘ I was on the spot at the death of Ali <unk> .
I was present during his last moments .
I know what is become of <unk> and Haydée .
I am at the command of the <unk> , and even claim the honor of being heard .
I shall be in the <unk> when this note is delivered to you . ’ “ ‘ And who is this witness , or rather this enemy ? ’ asked the count , in a tone in which there was a visible alteration .
‘ We shall know , sir , ’ replied the president .
‘ Is the <unk> willing to hear this witness ? ’ — ‘ Yes , yes , ’ they all said at once .
The <unk> was called .
‘ Is there anyone in the <unk> ? ’ said the president .
“ ‘ Yes , sir . ’ — ‘ Who is it ? ’ — ‘ A woman , accompanied by a servant . ’ <unk> looked at his neighbor .
‘ <unk> her in , ’ said the president .
Five minutes after the <unk> again appeared ; all eyes were fixed on the door , and I , ” said Beauchamp , “ shared the general expectation and anxiety .
Behind the <unk> walked a woman enveloped in a large veil , which completely concealed her .
It was evident , from her figure and the <unk> she had about her , that she was young and <unk> in her <unk> , but that was all .
The president requested her to throw aside her veil , and it was then seen that she was dressed in the <unk> costume , and was remarkably beautiful . ” “ Ah , ” said Albert , “ it was she . ” “ Who ? ” “ Haydée . ” “ Who told you that ? ” “ Alas , I guess it .
But go on , Beauchamp .
You see I am calm and strong .
And yet we must be drawing near the <unk> . ” “ M.
de Morcerf , ” continued Beauchamp , “ looked at this woman with surprise and terror .
Her lips were about to pass his sentence of life or death .
To the <unk> the adventure was so extraordinary and curious , that the interest they had felt for the count ’ s safety became now quite a <unk> matter .
The president himself advanced to place a seat for the young lady ; but she declined <unk> herself of it .
As for the count , he had fallen on his chair ; it was evident that his legs refused to support him .
“ ‘ Madame , ’ said the president , ‘ you have engaged to furnish the <unk> with some important particulars respecting the affair at Yanina , and you have stated that you were an <unk> of the event . ’ — ‘ I was , indeed , ’ said the stranger , with a tone of sweet melancholy , and with the <unk> voice peculiar to the East .
“ ‘ But allow me to say that you must have been very young then . ’ — ‘ I was four years old ; but as those events deeply concerned me , not a single detail has escaped my memory . ’ — ‘ In what manner could these events concern you ?
and who are you , that they should have made so deep an impression on you ? ’ — ‘ On them depended my father ’ s life , ’ replied she .
‘ I am Haydée , the daughter of Ali <unk> , <unk> of Yanina , and of <unk> , his beloved wife . ’ <unk> “ The blush of mingled pride and modesty which suddenly <unk> the cheeks of the young woman , the <unk> of her eye , and her highly important communication , produced an indescribable effect on the assembly .
As for the count , he could not have been more overwhelmed if a <unk> had fallen at his feet and opened an immense gulf before him .
“ ‘ Madame , ’ replied the president , bowing with profound respect , ‘ allow me to ask one question ; it shall be the last : Can you prove the <unk> of what you have now stated ? ’ “ ‘ I can , sir , ’ said Haydée , drawing from under her veil a satin <unk> highly <unk> ; ‘ for here is the <unk> of my birth , signed by my father and his principal officers , and that of my <unk> , my father having <unk> to my being brought up in my mother ’ s faith , — this latter has been sealed by the grand <unk> of <unk> and <unk> ; and <unk> ( and perhaps the most important ) , the record of the <unk> of my person and that of my mother to the <unk> merchant <unk> , by the French officer , who , in his infamous <unk> with the <unk> , had reserved as his part of the <unk> the wife and daughter of his benefactor , whom he sold for the sum of four hundred thousand francs . ’ A <unk> pallor spread over the count ’ s cheeks , and his eyes became <unk> at these terrible <unk> , which were listened to by the assembly with <unk> silence .
“ Haydée , still calm , but with a calmness more dreadful than the anger of another would have been , handed to the president the record of her <unk> , written in <unk> .
It had been supposed some of the papers might be in the Arabian , <unk> , or <unk> language , and the <unk> of the House was in <unk> .
One of the noble <unk> , who was familiar with the <unk> language , having studied it during the famous <unk> <unk> , followed with his eye as the <unk> read aloud : “ ‘ I , <unk> , a <unk> , and <unk> of the <unk> of his <unk> , acknowledge having received for <unk> to the sublime emperor , from the French lord , the Count of Monte Cristo , an <unk> <unk> at eight hundred thousand francs ; as the <unk> of a young Christian slave of eleven years of age , named Haydée , the acknowledged daughter of the late lord Ali <unk> , <unk> of Yanina , and of <unk> , his favorite ; she having been sold to me seven years previously , with her mother , who had died on arriving at <unk> , by a French colonel in the service of the <unk> Ali <unk> , named Fernand <unk> .
The <unk> purchase was made on his <unk> ’ s account , whose <unk> I had , for the sum of four hundred thousand francs .
“ ‘ <unk> at <unk> , by authority of his <unk> , in the year <unk> of the <unk> .
“ ‘ <unk> , <unk> . ’ “ ‘ That this record should have all due authority , it shall bear the <unk> <unk> , which the <unk> is bound to have <unk> to it . ’ “ <unk> the merchant ’ s signature there was , indeed , the <unk> of the sublime emperor .
A dreadful silence followed the reading of this <unk> ; the count could only <unk> , and his gaze , fixed as if unconsciously on Haydée , seemed one of fire and blood .
‘ Madame , ’ said the president , ‘ may <unk> be made to the Count of Monte Cristo , who is now , I believe , in Paris ? ’ “ ‘ Sir , ’ replied Haydée , ‘ the Count of Monte Cristo , my <unk> , has been in <unk> the last three days . ’ “ ‘ Who , then , has <unk> you to take this step , one for which the court is deeply indebted to you , and which is perfectly natural , considering your birth and your misfortunes ? ’ — ‘ Sir , ’ replied Haydée , ‘ I have been led to take this step from a feeling of respect and grief .
Although a Christian , may God forgive me , I have always sought to revenge my illustrious father .
Since I set my foot in France , and knew the <unk> lived in Paris , I have watched carefully .
I live retired in the house of my noble protector , but I do it from choice .
I love <unk> and silence , because I can live with my thoughts and recollections of past days .
But the Count of Monte Cristo <unk> me with every paternal care , and I am ignorant of nothing which passes in the world .
I learn all in the silence of my apartments , — for instance , I see all the newspapers , every <unk> , as well as every new piece of music ; and by thus watching the course of the life of others , I learned what had <unk> this morning in the House of <unk> , and what was to take place this evening ; then I wrote . ’ <unk> “ ‘ Then , ’ remarked the president , ‘ the Count of Monte Cristo knows nothing of your present <unk> ? ’ — ‘ He is quite <unk> of them , and I have but one fear , which is that he should <unk> of what I have done .
But it is a <unk> day for me , ’ continued the young girl , raising her ardent gaze to heaven , ‘ that on which I find at last an opportunity of <unk> my father ! ’ “ The count had not uttered one word the whole of this time .
His <unk> looked at him , and doubtless <unk> his prospects , <unk> under the <unk> breath of a woman .
His misery was <unk> in sinister lines on his countenance .
‘ M.
de Morcerf , ’ said the president , ‘ do you recognize this lady as the daughter of Ali <unk> , <unk> of Yanina ? ’ — ‘ No , ’ said Morcerf , <unk> to rise , ‘ it is a base plot , contrived by my enemies . ’ Haydée , whose eyes had been fixed on the door , as if expecting someone , turned hastily , and , seeing the count standing , <unk> , ‘ You do not know me ? ’ said she .
‘ Well , I fortunately recognize you !
You are Fernand <unk> , the French officer who led the troops of my noble father !
It is you who <unk> the castle of Yanina !
It is you who , sent by him to <unk> , to treat with the emperor for the life or death of your benefactor , brought back a false <unk> <unk> full pardon !
It is you who , with that <unk> , obtained the <unk> ’ s ring , which gave you authority over Selim , the <unk> !
It is you who <unk> Selim .
It is you who sold us , my mother and me , to the merchant , <unk> !
<unk> , assassin , assassin , you have still on your brow your master ’ s blood !
Look , gentlemen , all ! ’ “ These words had been pronounced with such enthusiasm and evident truth , that every eye was fixed on the count ’ s forehead , and he himself passed his hand across it , as if he felt Ali ’ s blood still <unk> there .
‘ You positively recognize M. de Morcerf as the officer , Fernand <unk> ? ’ — ‘ Indeed I do ! ’ cried Haydée .
‘ Oh , my mother , it was you who said , “ You were free , you had a beloved father , you were destined to be almost a <unk> .
Look well at that man ; it is he who raised your father ’ s head on the point of a <unk> ; it is he who sold us ; it is he who <unk> us !
Look well at his right hand , on which he has a large wound ; if you forgot his features , you would know him by that hand , into which fell , one by one , the gold pieces of the merchant <unk> ! ” I know him !
Ah , let him say now if he does not recognize me ! ’ Each word fell like a <unk> on Morcerf , and deprived him of a portion of his energy ; as she uttered the last , he hid his <unk> hand hastily in his bosom , and fell back on his seat , overwhelmed by wretchedness and despair .
This scene completely changed the opinion of the assembly respecting the accused count .
“ ‘ Count of Morcerf , ’ said the president , ‘ do not allow yourself to be cast down ; answer .
The justice of the court is supreme and <unk> as that of God ; it will not suffer you to be <unk> on by your enemies without giving you an opportunity of <unk> yourself .
Shall further inquiries be made ?
Shall two members of the House be sent to Yanina ?
Speak ! ’ Morcerf did not reply .
Then all the members looked at each other with terror .
They knew the count ’ s energetic and violent temper ; it must be , indeed , a dreadful blow which would <unk> him of courage to defend himself .
They expected that his stupefied silence would be followed by a <unk> <unk> .
‘ Well , ’ asked the president , ‘ what is your decision ? ’ <unk> “ ‘ I have no reply to make , ’ said the count in a low tone .
“ ‘ Has the daughter of Ali <unk> spoken the truth ? ’ said the president .
‘ Is she , then , the terrible witness to whose charge you dare not <unk> “ Not guilty ” ?
Have you really committed the crimes of which you are accused ? ’ The count looked around him with an expression which might have softened <unk> , but which could not <unk> his judges .
Then he raised his eyes towards the ceiling , but withdrew then , immediately , as if he feared the roof would open and reveal to his distressed view that second <unk> called heaven , and that other judge named God .
Then , with a hasty movement , he tore open his coat , which seemed to <unk> him , and flew from the room like a madman ; his <unk> was heard one moment in the corridor , then the <unk> of his <unk> as he was driven rapidly away .
‘ Gentlemen , ’ said the president , when silence was restored , ‘ is the Count of Morcerf <unk> of <unk> , <unk> , and conduct <unk> a member of this House ? ’ — ‘ Yes , ’ replied all the members of the <unk> of inquiry with a <unk> voice .
“ Haydée had remained until the close of the meeting .
She heard the count ’ s sentence pronounced without <unk> an expression of joy or pity ; then drawing her veil over her face she bowed <unk> to the <unk> , and left with that <unk> step which <unk> <unk> to his <unk> . ” Chapter <unk> .
The <unk> Then , ” continued Beauchamp , “ I took advantage of the silence and the darkness to leave the house without being seen .
The <unk> who had introduced me was waiting for me at the door , and he conducted me through the <unk> to a private entrance opening into the Rue de <unk> .
I left with mingled feelings of sorrow and delight .
Excuse me , Albert , — sorrow on your account , and delight with that noble girl , thus pursuing paternal vengeance .
Yes , Albert , from whatever source the blow may have proceeded — it may be from an enemy , but that enemy is only the agent of Providence . ” Albert held his head between his hands ; he raised his face , red with shame and bathed in tears , and seizing Beauchamp ’ s arm : “ My friend , ” said he , “ my life is ended .
I cannot calmly say with you , ‘ Providence has struck the blow ; ’ but I must discover who <unk> me with this hatred , and when I have found him I shall kill him , or he will kill me .
I rely on your friendship to assist me , Beauchamp , if contempt has not <unk> it from your heart . ” “ <unk> , my friend ?
How does this misfortune affect you ?
No , happily that unjust <unk> is forgotten which made the son <unk> for the father ’ s actions .
<unk> your life , Albert ; although it is only just beginning , did a lovely summer ’ s day ever dawn with greater purity than has marked the <unk> of your career ?
No , Albert , take my advice .
You are young and rich — leave Paris — all is soon forgotten in this great <unk> of excitement and changing <unk> .
You will return after three or four years with a <unk> <unk> for a bride , and no one will think more of what occurred yesterday than if it had happened sixteen years ago . ” “ Thank you , my dear Beauchamp , thank you for the excellent feeling which <unk> your advice ; but it cannot be .
I have told you my wish , or rather my determination .
You understand that , interested as I am in this affair , I cannot see it in the same light as you do .
What appears to you to <unk> from a celestial source , seems to me to proceed from one far less pure .
Providence appears to me to have no share in this affair ; and happily so , for instead of the invisible , <unk> agent of celestial <unk> and <unk> , I shall find one both <unk> and visible , on whom I shall revenge myself , I assure you , for all I have suffered during the last month .
Now , I repeat , Beauchamp , I wish to return to human and material existence , and if you are still the friend you <unk> to be , help me to discover the hand that struck the blow . ” “ Be it so , ” said Beauchamp ; “ if you must have me descend to earth , I submit ; and if you will seek your enemy , I will assist you , and I will engage to find him , my honor being almost as deeply interested as yours . ” “ Well , then , you understand , Beauchamp , that we begin our search immediately .
Each moment ’ s delay is an eternity for me .
The <unk> is not yet punished , and he may hope that he will not be ; but , on my honor , if he thinks so , he <unk> himself . ” “ Well , listen , Morcerf . ” “ Ah , Beauchamp , I see you know something already ; you will restore me to life . ” “ I do not say there is any truth in what I am going to tell you , but it is , at least , a ray of light in a dark night ; by following it we may , perhaps , discover something more certain . ” “ Tell me ; satisfy my impatience . ” “ Well , I will tell you what I did not like to mention on my return from Yanina . ” “ Say on . ” “ I went , of course , to the chief banker of the town to make inquiries .
At the first word , before I had even mentioned your father ’ s name ” — “ ‘ Ah , ’ said he .
‘ I guess what brings you here . ’ “ ‘ How , and why ? ’ “ ‘ Because a fortnight since I was questioned on the same subject . ’ “ ‘ By whom ? ’ “ ‘ By a banker of Paris , my correspondent . ’ “ ‘ <unk> name is — — ’ “ ‘ Danglars . ’ ” “ He ! ” cried Albert ; “ yes , it is indeed he who has so long pursued my father with jealous hatred .
He , the man who would be popular , cannot forgive the Count of Morcerf for being created a <unk> ; and this marriage broken off without a reason being <unk> — yes , it is all from the same cause . ” “ Make inquiries , Albert , but do not be angry without reason ; make inquiries , and if it be true — — ” “ Oh , yes , if it be true , ” cried the young man , “ he shall pay me all I have suffered . ” “ <unk> , Morcerf , he is already an old man . ” “ I will respect his age as he has respected the honor of my family ; if my father had offended him , why did he not attack him <unk> ?
Oh , no , he was afraid to encounter him face to face . ” “ I do not <unk> you , Albert ; I only restrain you .
<unk> <unk> . ” “ Oh , do not fear ; besides , you will accompany me .
Beauchamp , solemn <unk> should be <unk> by a witness .
Before this day <unk> , if M. Danglars is guilty , he shall cease to live , or I shall die .
_ <unk> _ , Beauchamp , mine shall be a splendid funeral ! ” “ When such <unk> are made , Albert , they should be <unk> executed .
Do you wish to go to M. Danglars ?
Let us go immediately . ” They sent for a cabriolet .
On entering the banker ’ s <unk> , they perceived the <unk> and servant of M. Andrea Cavalcanti .
“ Ah !
_ <unk> ! _ that ’ s good , ” said Albert , with a gloomy tone .
“ If M. Danglars will not fight with me , I will kill his <unk> ; Cavalcanti will certainly fight . ” The servant announced the young man ; but the banker , <unk> what had <unk> the day before , did not wish him admitted .
It was , however , too late ; Albert had followed the <unk> , and , hearing the order given , forced the door open , and followed by Beauchamp found himself in the banker ’ s study .
“ Sir , ” cried the latter , “ am I no longer at liberty to receive whom I choose in my house ?
You appear to forget yourself sadly . ” “ No , sir , ” said Albert , coldly ; “ there are circumstances in which one cannot , except through <unk> , — I offer you that refuge , — refuse to admit certain persons at least . ” “ What is your <unk> , then , with me , sir ? ” “ I mean , ” said Albert , drawing near , and without apparently <unk> Cavalcanti , who stood with his back towards the fireplace — “ I mean to propose a meeting in some retired corner where no one will <unk> us for ten minutes ; that will be sufficient — where two men having met , one of them will remain on the ground . ” Danglars turned pale ; Cavalcanti moved a step forward , and Albert turned towards him .
“ And you , too , ” said he , “ come , if you like , monsieur ; you have a claim , being almost one of the family , and I will give as many <unk> of that kind as I can find persons willing to accept them . ” Cavalcanti looked at Danglars with a stupefied air , and the latter , making an effort , arose and stepped between the two young men .
Albert ’ s attack on Andrea had placed him on a different <unk> , and he hoped this visit had another cause than that he had at first supposed .
“ Indeed , sir , ” said he to Albert , “ if you are come to quarrel with this gentleman because I have preferred him to you , I shall <unk> the case to the king ’ s attorney . ” “ You mistake , sir , ” said Morcerf with a gloomy smile ; “ I am not <unk> in the least to <unk> , and I only addressed myself to M. Cavalcanti because he appeared disposed to interfere between us .
In one respect you are right , for I am ready to quarrel with everyone today ; but you have the first claim , M. Danglars . ” <unk> “ Sir , ” replied Danglars , pale with anger and fear , “ I warn you , when I have the misfortune to meet with a mad dog , I kill it ; and far from thinking myself guilty of a crime , I believe I do society a kindness .
Now , if you are mad and try to <unk> me , I will kill you without pity .
Is it my fault that your father has <unk> himself ? ” “ Yes , miserable wretch ! ” cried Morcerf , “ it is your fault . ” Danglars retreated a few steps .
“ My fault ? ” said he ; “ you must be mad !
What do I know of the <unk> affair ?
Have I travelled in that country ?
Did I advise your father to sell the castle of Yanina — to betray — — ” “ Silence ! ” said Albert , with a <unk> voice .
“ No ; it is not you who have directly made this <unk> and brought this sorrow on us , but you <unk> <unk> it . ” “ I ? ” “ Yes ; you !
How came it known ? ” “ I suppose you read it in the paper in the account from Yanina ? ” “ Who wrote to Yanina ? ” “ To Yanina ? ” “ Yes .
Who wrote for particulars concerning my father ? ” “ I imagine anyone may write to Yanina . ” “ But one person only wrote ! ” “ One only ? ” “ Yes ; and that was you ! ” “ I , doubtless , wrote .
It appears to me that when about to marry your daughter to a young man , it is right to make some inquiries respecting his family ; it is not only a right , but a duty . ” “ You wrote , sir , knowing what answer you would receive . ” “ I , indeed ?
I assure you , ” cried Danglars , with a confidence and security proceeding less from fear than from the interest he really felt for the young man , “ I solemnly declare to you , that I should never have thought of writing to Yanina , did I know anything of Ali <unk> ’ s misfortunes . ” “ Who , then , urged you to write ?
Tell me . ” “ _ <unk> ! _ it was the most simple thing in the world .
I was speaking of your father ’ s past history .
I said the origin of his fortune remained obscure .
The person to whom I addressed my scruples asked me where your father had acquired his property ?
I answered , ‘ In Greece . ’ — ‘ Then , ’ said he , ‘ write to Yanina . ’ ” “ And who thus <unk> you ? ” “ No other than your friend , Monte Cristo . ” “ The Count of Monte Cristo told you to write to Yanina ? ” “ Yes ; and I wrote , and will show you my <unk> , if you like . ” Albert and Beauchamp looked at each other .
“ Sir , ” said Beauchamp , who had not yet spoken , “ you appear to <unk> the count , who is absent from Paris at this moment , and cannot <unk> himself . ” “ I <unk> no one , sir , ” said Danglars ; “ I relate , and I will repeat before the count what I have said to you . ” “ Does the count know what answer you received ? ” “ Yes ; I showed it to him . ” “ Did he know my father ’ s Christian name was Fernand , and his family name <unk> ? ” “ Yes , I had told him that long since , and I did only what any other would have done in my circumstances , and perhaps less .
When , the day after the arrival of this answer , your father came by the advice of Monte Cristo to ask my daughter ’ s hand for you , I decidedly refused him , but without any explanation or <unk> .
In short , why should I have any more to do with the affair ?
How did the honor or disgrace of M. de Morcerf affect me ?
It neither increased nor <unk> my income . ” Albert felt the blood <unk> to his brow ; there was no doubt upon the subject .
Danglars <unk> himself with the <unk> , but at the same time with the assurance , of a man who speaks the truth , at least in part , if not wholly — not for conscience ’ sake , but through fear .
Besides , what was Morcerf seeking ?
It was not whether Danglars or Monte Cristo was more or less guilty ; it was a man who would answer for the offence , whether trifling or serious ; it was a man who would fight , and it was evident Danglars would not fight .
In addition to this , everything forgotten or <unk> before presented itself now to his recollection .
Monte Cristo knew everything , as he had bought the daughter of Ali <unk> ; and , knowing everything , he had <unk> Danglars to write to Yanina .
The answer known , he had yielded to Albert ’ s wish to be introduced to Haydée , and allowed the conversation to turn on the death of Ali , and had not opposed Haydée ’ s <unk> ( but having , doubtless , warned the young girl , in the few <unk> words he spoke to her , not to <unk> Morcerf ’ s father ) .
Besides , had he not begged of Morcerf not to mention his father ’ s name before Haydée ?
<unk> , he had taken Albert to <unk> when he knew the final blow was near .
There could be no doubt that all had been calculated and previously arranged ; Monte Cristo then was in league with his father ’ s enemies .
Albert took Beauchamp aside , and communicated these ideas to him .
“ You are right , ” said the latter ; “ M.
Danglars has only been a <unk> agent in this sad affair , and it is of M. de Monte Cristo that you must demand an explanation . ” Albert turned .
“ Sir , ” said he to Danglars , “ understand that I do not take a final leave of you ; I must ascertain if your <unk> are just , and am going now to inquire of the Count of Monte Cristo . ” He bowed to the banker , and went out with Beauchamp , without appearing to notice Cavalcanti .
Danglars accompanied him to the door , where he again assured Albert that no motive of personal hatred had <unk> him against the Count of Morcerf .
Chapter <unk> .
The <unk> At the banker ’ s door Beauchamp stopped Morcerf .
“ Listen , ” said he ; “ just now I told you it was of M. de Monte Cristo you must demand an explanation . ” “ Yes ; and we are going to his house . ” “ <unk> , Morcerf , one moment before you go . ” “ On what shall I reflect ? ” “ On the importance of the step you are taking . ” “ Is it more serious than going to M. Danglars ? ” “ Yes ; M. Danglars is a <unk> , and those who love money , you know , think too much of what they risk to be easily induced to fight a duel .
The other is , on the contrary , to all appearance a true <unk> ; but do you not fear to find him a <unk> ? ” “ I only fear one thing ; <unk> , to find a man who will not fight . ” “ Do not be alarmed , ” said Beauchamp ; “ he will meet you .
My only fear is that he will be too strong for you . ” “ My friend , ” said Morcerf , with a sweet smile , “ that is what I wish .
The <unk> thing that could occur to me , would be to die in my father ’ s <unk> ; that would save us all . ” “ Your mother would die of grief . ” “ My poor mother ! ” said Albert , passing his hand across his eyes , “ I know she would ; but better so than die of shame . ” “ Are you quite decided , Albert ? ” “ Yes ; let us go . ” “ But do you think we shall find the count at home ? ” “ He intended returning some hours after me , and doubtless he is now at home . ” They ordered the driver to take them to No .
30 Champs-Élysées .
Beauchamp wished to go in alone , but Albert observed that as this was an unusual circumstance he might be allowed to <unk> from the usual <unk> of <unk> .
The cause which the young man <unk> was one so sacred that Beauchamp had only to comply with all his wishes ; he yielded and contented himself with following Morcerf .
Albert sprang from the porter ’ s lodge to the steps .
He was received by Baptistin .
The count had , indeed , just arrived , but he was in his <unk> , and had forbidden that anyone should be admitted .
“ But after his <unk> ? ” asked Morcerf .
“ My master will go to dinner . ” “ And after dinner ? ” “ He will sleep an hour . ” “ Then ? ” “ He is going to the Opera . ” “ Are you sure of it ? ” asked Albert .
“ Quite , sir ; my master has ordered his horses at eight o ’ clock precisely . ” “ Very good , ” replied Albert ; “ that is all I wished to know . ” Then , turning towards Beauchamp , “ If you have anything to attend to , Beauchamp , do it directly ; if you have any <unk> for this evening , <unk> it till tomorrow .
I depend on you to accompany me to the Opera ; and if you can , bring Château-Renaud with you . ” Beauchamp <unk> himself of Albert ’ s permission , and left him , <unk> to call for him at a quarter before eight .
On his return home , Albert expressed his wish to Franz Debray , and Morrel , to see them at the Opera that evening .
Then he went to see his mother , who since the events of the day before had refused to see anyone , and had kept her room .
He found her in bed , overwhelmed with grief at this public <unk> .
The sight of Albert produced the effect which might naturally be expected on Mercédès ; she pressed her son ’ s hand and <unk> aloud , but her tears relieved her .
Albert stood one moment <unk> by the side of his mother ’ s bed .
It was evident from his pale face and <unk> <unk> that his resolution to revenge himself was growing <unk> .
“ My dear mother , ” said he , “ do you know if M. de Morcerf has any enemy ? ” Mercédès started ; she noticed that the young man did not say “ my father . ” “ My son , ” she said , “ persons in the count ’ s situation have many secret enemies .
Those who are known are not the most dangerous . ” “ I know it , and appeal to your <unk> .
You are of so superior a mind , nothing <unk> you . ” “ Why do you say so ? ” “ Because , for instance , you noticed on the evening of the ball we gave , that M. de Monte Cristo would eat nothing in our house . ” Mercédès raised herself on her feverish arm .
“ M.
de Monte Cristo ! ” she exclaimed ; “ and how is he connected with the question you asked me ? ” <unk> “ You know , mother , M. de Monte Cristo is almost an <unk> , and it is <unk> with the <unk> to secure full liberty for revenge by not eating or drinking in the houses of their enemies . ” “ Do you say M. de Monte Cristo is our enemy ? ” replied Mercédès , becoming <unk> than the sheet which covered her .
“ Who told you so ?
Why , you are mad , Albert !
M. de Monte Cristo has only shown us kindness .
M. de Monte Cristo saved your life ; you yourself presented him to us .
Oh , I entreat you , my son , if you had entertained such an idea , <unk> it ; and my counsel to you — nay , my prayer — is to retain his friendship . ” “ Mother , ” replied the young man , “ you have special reasons for telling me to <unk> that man . ” “ I ? ” said Mercédès , <unk> as rapidly as she had turned pale , and again becoming <unk> than ever .
“ Yes , doubtless ; and is it not that he may never do us any harm ? ” Mercédès shuddered , and , fixing on her son a <unk> gaze , “ You speak strangely , ” said she to Albert , “ and you appear to have some singular prejudices .
What has the count done ?
Three days since you were with him in <unk> ; only three days since we looked on him as our best friend . ” An <unk> smile passed over Albert ’ s lips .
Mercédès saw it and with the double instinct of woman and mother guessed all ; but as she was prudent and <unk> she concealed both her sorrows and her fears .
Albert was silent ; an instant after , the countess resumed : “ You came to inquire after my health ; I will <unk> acknowledge that I am not well .
You should <unk> yourself here , and <unk> my solitude .
I do not wish to be left alone . ” “ Mother , ” said the young man , “ you know how <unk> I would obey your wish , but an <unk> and important affair <unk> me to leave you for the whole evening . ” “ Well , ” replied Mercédès , <unk> , “ go , Albert ; I will not make you a slave to your <unk> <unk> . ” Albert pretended he did not hear , bowed to his mother , and quitted her .
<unk> had he shut her door , when Mercédès called a <unk> servant , and ordered him to follow Albert wherever he should go that evening , and to come and tell her immediately what he observed .
Then she rang for her lady ’ s maid , and , weak as she was , she dressed , in order to be ready for whatever might happen .
The <unk> ’ s mission was an easy one .
Albert went to his room , and dressed with unusual care .
At ten minutes to eight Beauchamp arrived ; he had seen Château-Renaud , who had promised to be in the <unk> before the curtain was raised .
Both got into Albert ’ s _ <unk> _ ; and , as the young man had no reason to conceal where he was going , he called aloud , “ To the Opera . ” In his impatience he arrived before the beginning of the <unk> .
<unk> Château-Renaud was at his post ; <unk> by Beauchamp of the circumstances , he required no explanation from Albert .
The conduct of the son in seeking to <unk> his father was so natural that Château-Renaud did not seek to <unk> him , and was content with <unk> his <unk> of devotion .
Debray was not yet come , but Albert knew that he seldom lost a scene at the Opera .
Albert wandered about the theatre until the curtain was drawn up .
He hoped to meet with M. de Monte Cristo either in the <unk> or on the stairs .
The bell summoned him to his seat , and he entered the <unk> with Château-Renaud and Beauchamp .
But his eyes scarcely quitted the box between the <unk> , which remained <unk> closed during the whole of the first act .
At last , as Albert was looking at his watch for about the <unk> time , at the beginning of the second act the door opened , and Monte Cristo entered , dressed in black , and , leaning over the front of the box , looked around the <unk> .
Morrel followed him , and looked also for his sister and brother <unk> ; he soon discovered them in another box , and kissed his hand to them .
The count , in his <unk> of the <unk> , encountered a pale face and threatening eyes , which evidently sought to gain his attention .
He recognized Albert , but thought it better not to notice him , as he looked so angry and <unk> .
Without <unk> his thoughts to his companion , he sat down , drew out his <unk> , and looked another way .
Although apparently not <unk> Albert , he did not , however , lose sight of him , and when the curtain fell at the end of the second act , he saw him leave the <unk> with his two friends .
Then his head was seen passing at the back of the boxes , and the count knew that the approaching storm was intended to fall on him .
He was at the moment conversing cheerfully with Morrel , but he was well prepared for what might happen .
The door opened , and Monte Cristo , turning round , saw Albert , pale and trembling , followed by Beauchamp and Château-Renaud .
“ Well , ” cried he , with that benevolent politeness which distinguished his <unk> from the common <unk> of the world , “ my <unk> has attained his object .
<unk> , M. de Morcerf . ” The countenance of this man , who possessed such extraordinary <unk> over his feelings , expressed the most perfect <unk> .
Morrel only then recollected the letter he had received from the viscount , in which , without <unk> any reason , he begged him to go to the Opera , but he understood that something terrible was <unk> .
“ We are not come here , sir , to exchange <unk> expressions of politeness , or false <unk> of friendship , ” said Albert , “ but to demand an explanation . ” The young man ’ s trembling voice was scarcely audible .
“ An explanation at the Opera ? ” said the count , with that calm tone and penetrating eye which <unk> the man who knows his cause is good .
“ Little acquainted as I am with the habits of <unk> , I should not have thought this the place for such a demand . ” “ Still , if people will shut themselves up , ” said Albert , “ and cannot be seen because they are <unk> , <unk> , or asleep , we must <unk> ourselves of the opportunity whenever they are to be seen . ” “ I am not difficult of access , sir ; for yesterday , if my memory does not deceive me , you were at my house . ” “ <unk> I was at your house , sir , ” said the young man ; “ because then I knew not who you were . ” In <unk> these words Albert had raised his voice so as to be heard by those in the adjoining boxes and in the <unk> .
Thus the attention of many was attracted by this <unk> .
“ Where are you come from , sir ?
“ said Monte Cristo “ You do not appear to be in the possession of your senses . ” “ <unk> I understand your <unk> , sir , and succeed in making you understand that I will be <unk> , I shall be reasonable enough , ” said Albert <unk> .
“ I do not understand you , sir , ” replied Monte Cristo ; “ and if I did , your tone is too high .
I am at home here , and I alone have a right to raise my voice above another ’ s .
Leave the box , sir ! ” Monte Cristo pointed towards the door with the most <unk> dignity .
“ Ah , I shall know how to make you leave your home ! ” replied Albert , <unk> in his <unk> grasp the <unk> , which Monte Cristo did not lose sight of .
“ Well , well , ” said Monte Cristo quietly , “ I see you wish to quarrel with me ; but I would give you one piece of advice , which you will do well to keep in mind .
It is in poor taste to make a display of a <unk> .
<unk> is not becoming to everyone , M. de Morcerf . ” At this name a murmur of astonishment passed around the group of spectators of this scene .
They had talked of no one but Morcerf the whole day .
Albert understood the allusion in a moment , and was about to throw his <unk> at the count , when Morrel seized his hand , while Beauchamp and Château-Renaud , fearing the scene would <unk> the <unk> of a <unk> , held him back .
But Monte Cristo , without rising , and leaning forward in his chair , merely stretched out his arm and , taking the damp , crushed <unk> from the clenched hand of the young man : “ Sir , ” said he in a solemn tone , “ I consider your <unk> thrown , and will return it to you wrapped around a bullet .
Now leave me or I will summon my servants to throw you out at the door . ” <unk> , almost unconscious , and with eyes <unk> , Albert stepped back , and Morrel closed the door .
Monte Cristo took up his glass again as if nothing had happened ; his face was like marble , and his heart was like <unk> .
Morrel whispered , “ What have you done to him ? ” “ I ?
Nothing — at least <unk> , ” said Monte Cristo .
“ But there must be some cause for this strange scene . ” “ The Count of Morcerf ’ s adventure <unk> the young man . ” “ Have you anything to do with it ? ” “ It was through Haydée that the Chamber was informed of his father ’ s <unk> . ” “ Indeed ? ” said Morrel .
“ I had been told , but would not credit it , that the <unk> slave I have seen with you here in this very box was the daughter of Ali <unk> . ” “ It is true , nevertheless . ” “ Then , ” said Morrel , “ I understand it all , and this scene was <unk> . ” “ How so ? ” “ Yes .
Albert wrote to request me to come to the Opera , doubtless that I might be a witness to the insult he meant to offer you . ” “ <unk> , ” said Monte Cristo with his <unk> tranquillity .
“ But what shall you do with him ? ” “ With whom ? ” “ With Albert . ” “ What shall I do with Albert ?
As certainly , Maximilian , as I now press your hand , I shall kill him before ten o ’ clock tomorrow morning . ” Morrel , in his turn , took Monte Cristo ’ s hand in both of his , and he shuddered to feel how cold and steady it was .
“ Ah , count , ” said he , “ his father loves him so much ! ” “ Do not speak to me of that , ” said Monte Cristo , with the first movement of anger he had betrayed ; “ I will make him suffer . ” Morrel , amazed , let fall Monte Cristo ’ s hand .
“ Count , count ! ” said he .
“ Dear Maximilian , ” interrupted the count , “ listen how <unk> <unk> is singing that line , — ‘ O <unk> !
<unk> de <unk> <unk> ! ’ “ I was the first to discover <unk> at Naples , and the first to <unk> him .
<unk> , <unk> ! ” Morrel saw it was useless to say more , and <unk> .
The curtain , which had risen at the close of the scene with Albert , again fell , and a <unk> was heard at the door .
“ Come in , ” said Monte Cristo with a voice that betrayed not the least emotion ; and immediately Beauchamp appeared .
“ <unk> , M. Beauchamp , ” said Monte Cristo , as if this was the first time he had seen the <unk> that evening ; “ be seated . ” Beauchamp bowed , and , sitting down , “ Sir , ” said he , “ I just now accompanied M. de Morcerf , as you saw . ” “ And that means , ” replied Monte Cristo , laughing , “ that you had , probably , just dined together .
I am happy to see , M. Beauchamp , that you are more <unk> than he was . ” “ Sir , ” said M. Beauchamp , “ Albert was wrong , I acknowledge , to betray so much anger , and I come , on my own account , to <unk> for him .
And having done so , entirely on my own account , be it understood , I would add that I believe you too <unk> to refuse giving him some explanation concerning your connection with Yanina .
Then I will add two words about the young Greek girl . ” Monte Cristo motioned him to be silent .
“ Come , ” said he , laughing , “ there are all my hopes about to be destroyed . ” “ How so ? ” asked Beauchamp .
“ <unk> you wish to make me appear a very eccentric character .
I am , in your opinion , a <unk> , a <unk> , a Lord <unk> ; then , just as I am arriving at the <unk> , you <unk> your own end , and seek to make an ordinary man of me .
You bring me down to your own level , and demand <unk> !
Indeed , M. Beauchamp , it is quite <unk> . ” “ Yet , ” replied Beauchamp <unk> , “ there are occasions when <unk> <unk> — — ” “ M.
Beauchamp , ” <unk> this strange man , “ the Count of Monte Cristo <unk> to none but the Count of Monte Cristo himself .
Say no more , I entreat you .
I do what I please , M. Beauchamp , and it is always well done . ” “ Sir , ” replied the young man , “ honest men are not to be paid with such coin .
I require honorable <unk> . ” “ I am , sir , a living <unk> , ” replied Monte Cristo , motionless , but with a threatening look ; “ we have both blood in our veins which we wish to shed — that is our mutual <unk> .
Tell the viscount so , and that tomorrow , before ten o ’ clock , I shall see what color his is . ” “ Then I have only to make arrangements for the duel , ” said Beauchamp .
“ It is quite <unk> to me , ” said Monte Cristo , “ and it was very unnecessary to disturb me at the Opera for such a trifle .
In France people fight with the sword or pistol , in the <unk> with the <unk> , in <unk> with the <unk> .
Tell your <unk> that , although I am the <unk> party , in order to carry out my <unk> , I leave him the choice of arms , and will accept without discussion , without <unk> , anything , even combat by drawing <unk> , which is always stupid , but with me different from other people , as I am sure to gain . ” “ <unk> to gain ! ” repeated Beauchamp , looking with amazement at the count .
“ Certainly , ” said Monte Cristo , slightly <unk> his shoulders ; “ otherwise I would not fight with M. de Morcerf .
I shall kill him — I cannot help it .
Only by a single line this evening at my house let me know the arms and the hour ; I do not like to be kept waiting . ” “ <unk> , then , at eight o ’ clock , in the <unk> de <unk> , ” said Beauchamp , quite <unk> , not knowing if he was <unk> with an <unk> <unk> or a <unk> being .
“ Very well , sir , ” said Monte Cristo .
“ Now all that is settled , do let me see the <unk> , and tell your friend Albert not to come any more this evening ; he will hurt himself with all his <unk> <unk> : let him go home and go to sleep . ” Beauchamp left the box , perfectly amazed .
“ Now , ” said Monte Cristo , turning towards Morrel , “ I may depend upon you , may I not ? ” “ Certainly , ” said Morrel , “ I am at your service , count ; still — — ” “ What ? ” “ It is desirable I should know the real cause . ” “ That is to say , you would rather not ? ” “ No . ” “ The young man himself is acting <unk> , and knows not the true cause , which is known only to God and to me ; but I give you my word , Morrel , that God , who does know it , will be on our side . ” “ <unk> , ” said Morrel ; “ who is your second witness ? ” “ I know no one in Paris , Morrel , on whom I could <unk> that honor besides you and your brother Emmanuel .
Do you think Emmanuel would oblige me ? ” “ I will answer for him , count . ” “ Well ?
that is all I require .
<unk> morning , at seven o ’ clock , you will be with me , will you not ? ” “ We will . ” “ Hush , the curtain is rising .
Listen !
I never lose a note of this <unk> if I can avoid it ; the music of _ William Tell _ is so sweet . ” Chapter <unk> .
The Night Monte Cristo waited , according to his usual custom , until <unk> had <unk> his famous “ _ <unk> ! _ ” then he rose and went out .
Morrel took leave of him at the door , <unk> his promise to be with him the next morning at seven o ’ clock , and to bring Emmanuel .
Then he stepped into his _ <unk> _ , calm and smiling , and was at home in five minutes .
No one who knew the count could mistake his expression when , on entering , he said : “ Ali , bring me my pistols with the <unk> cross . ” Ali brought the box to his master , who examined the weapons with a solicitude very natural to a man who is about to <unk> his life to a little powder and shot .
These were pistols of an <unk> pattern , which Monte Cristo had had made for <unk> practice in his own room .
A cap was sufficient to drive out the bullet , and from the adjoining room no one would have suspected that the count was , as <unk> would say , keeping his hand in .
He was just taking one up and looking for the point to aim at on a little iron plate which served him as a <unk> , when his study door opened , and Baptistin entered .
Before he had spoken a word , the count saw in the next room a veiled woman , who had followed closely after Baptistin , and now , seeing the count with a pistol in his hand and swords on the table , rushed in .
Baptistin looked at his master , who made a sign to him , and he went out , closing the door after him .
“ Who are you , madame ? ” said the count to the veiled woman .
<unk> The stranger cast one look around her , to be certain that they were quite alone ; then bending as if she would have knelt , and <unk> her hands , she said with an accent of despair : “ Edmond , you will not kill my son ! ” The count retreated a step , uttered a slight exclamation , and let fall the pistol he held .
“ What name did you pronounce then , Madame de Morcerf ? ” said he .
“ <unk> ! ” cried she , throwing back her veil , — “ yours , which I alone , perhaps , have not forgotten .
Edmond , it is not Madame de Morcerf who is come to you , it is Mercédès . ” “ Mercédès is dead , madame , ” said Monte Cristo ; “ I know no one now of that name . ” “ Mercédès lives , sir , and she <unk> , for she alone recognized you when she saw you , and even before she saw you , by your voice , Edmond , — by the simple sound of your voice ; and from that moment she has followed your steps , watched you , feared you , and she needs not to inquire what hand has <unk> the blow which now strikes M. de Morcerf . ” “ Fernand , do you mean ? ” replied Monte Cristo , with bitter <unk> ; “ since we are <unk> names , let us remember them all . ” Monte Cristo had pronounced the name of Fernand with such an expression of hatred that Mercédès felt a <unk> of horror run through every <unk> .
“ You see , Edmond , I am not mistaken , and have cause to say , ‘ <unk> my son ! ’ ” “ And who told you , madame , that I have any <unk> intentions against your son ? ” “ No one , in truth ; but a mother has <unk> sight .
I guessed all ; I followed him this evening to the Opera , and , concealed in a <unk> box , have seen all . ” “ If you have seen all , madame , you know that the son of Fernand has <unk> <unk> me , ” said Monte Cristo with awful calmness .
“ Oh , for pity ’ s sake ! ” “ You have seen that he would have thrown his <unk> in my face if Morrel , one of my friends , had not stopped him . ” “ Listen to me , my son has also guessed who you are , — he <unk> his father ’ s misfortunes to you . ” “ Madame , you are mistaken , they are not misfortunes , — it is a punishment .
It is not I who strike M. de Morcerf ; it is Providence which <unk> him . ” “ And why do you <unk> Providence ? ” cried Mercédès .
“ Why do you remember when it <unk> ?
What are Yanina and its <unk> to you , Edmond ?
What <unk> has Fernand <unk> done you in <unk> Ali <unk> ? ” “ Ah , madame , ” replied Monte Cristo , “ all this is an affair between the French captain and the daughter of <unk> .
It does not concern me , you are right ; and if I have <unk> to revenge myself , it is not on the French captain , or the Count of Morcerf , but on the <unk> Fernand , the husband of Mercédès the <unk> . ” “ Ah , sir ! ” cried the countess , “ how terrible a vengeance for a fault which fatality made me commit ! — for I am the only <unk> , Edmond , and if you owe revenge to anyone , it is to me , who had not <unk> to bear your absence and my solitude . ” “ But , ” exclaimed Monte Cristo , “ why was I absent ?
And why were you alone ? ” <unk> “ Because you had been arrested , Edmond , and were a prisoner . ” “ And why was I arrested ?
Why was I a prisoner ? ” “ I do not know , ” said Mercédès .
“ You do not , madame ; at least , I hope not .
But I will tell you .
I was arrested and became a prisoner because , under the <unk> of La <unk> , the day before I was to marry you , a man named Danglars wrote this letter , which the <unk> Fernand himself posted . ” Monte Cristo went to a <unk> , opened a drawer by a spring , from which he took a paper which had lost its original color , and the ink of which had become of a <unk> hue — this he placed in the hands of Mercédès .
It was Danglars ’ letter to the king ’ s attorney , which the Count of Monte Cristo , <unk> as a clerk from the house of Thomson &amp; French , had taken from the file against Edmond Dantès , on the day he had paid the two hundred thousand francs to M. de Boville .
Mercédès read with terror the following lines : “ The king ’ s attorney is informed by a friend to the throne and religion that one Edmond Dantès , second in command on board the _ Pharaon _ , this day arrived from <unk> , after having touched at Naples and <unk> , is the <unk> of a letter from <unk> to the usurper , and of another letter from the usurper to the Bonapartist club in Paris .
<unk> <unk> of this statement may be obtained by <unk> the <unk> Edmond Dantès , who either <unk> the letter for Paris about with him , or has it at his father ’ s abode .
Should it not be found in possession of either father or son , then it will assuredly be discovered in the <unk> belonging to the said Dantès on board the _ Pharaon _ . ” “ How dreadful ! ” said Mercédès , passing her hand across her brow , <unk> with perspiration ; “ and that letter — — ” “ I bought it for two hundred thousand francs , madame , ” said Monte Cristo ; “ but that is a trifle , since it <unk> me to <unk> myself to you . ” “ And the result of that letter — — ” “ You well know , madame , was my arrest ; but you do not know how long that arrest lasted .
You do not know that I remained for fourteen years within a quarter of a league of you , in a dungeon in the Château d ’ If .
You do not know that every day of those fourteen years I renewed the <unk> of vengeance which I had made the first day ; and yet I was not aware that you had married Fernand , my <unk> , and that my father had died of hunger ! ” “ Can it be ? ” cried Mercédès , shuddering .
“ That is what I heard on leaving my prison fourteen years after I had entered it ; and that is why , on account of the living Mercédès and my <unk> father , I have <unk> to revenge myself on Fernand , and — I have <unk> myself . ” “ And you are sure the unhappy Fernand did that ? ” “ I am satisfied , madame , that he did what I have told you ; besides , that is not much more <unk> than that a Frenchman by <unk> should pass over to the English ; that a <unk> by birth should have fought against the <unk> ; that a <unk> of Ali should have betrayed and murdered Ali .
<unk> with such things , what is the letter you have just read ? — a lover ’ s <unk> , which the woman who has married that man ought certainly to forgive ; but not so the lover who was to have married her .
Well , the French did not <unk> themselves on the <unk> , the <unk> did not <unk> the <unk> , Ali in his tomb left the <unk> <unk> ; but I , betrayed , <unk> , buried , have risen from my tomb , by the grace of God , to <unk> that man .
He sends me for that purpose , and here I am . ” The poor woman ’ s head and arms fell ; her legs bent under her , and she fell on her knees .
“ <unk> , Edmond , forgive for my sake , who love you still ! ” The dignity of the wife <unk> the <unk> of the lover and the mother .
Her forehead almost touched the <unk> , when the count sprang forward and raised her .
Then seated on a chair , she looked at the <unk> countenance of Monte Cristo , on which grief and hatred still impressed a threatening expression .
“ Not crush that <unk> race ? ” murmured he ; “ abandon my purpose at the moment of its <unk> ?
Impossible , madame , impossible ! ” “ Edmond , ” said the poor mother , who tried every means , “ when I call you Edmond , why do you not call me Mercédès ? ” “ Mercédès ! ” repeated Monte Cristo ; “ Mercédès !
Well yes , you are right ; that name has still its <unk> , and this is the first time for a long period that I have pronounced it so distinctly .
Oh , Mercédès , I have uttered your name with the sigh of melancholy , with the groan of sorrow , with the last effort of despair ; I have uttered it when <unk> with cold , <unk> on the straw in my dungeon ; I have uttered it , <unk> with heat , rolling on the stone floor of my prison .
Mercédès , I must revenge myself , for I suffered fourteen years , — fourteen years I wept , I cursed ; now I tell you , Mercédès , I must revenge myself . ” The count , fearing to yield to the <unk> of her he had so <unk> loved , called his sufferings to the assistance of his hatred .
“ <unk> yourself , then , Edmond , ” cried the poor mother ; “ but let your vengeance fall on the <unk> , — on him , on me , but not on my son ! ” “ It is written in the good book , ” said Monte Cristo , “ that the sins of the fathers shall fall upon their children to the third and fourth <unk> .
Since God himself <unk> those words to his <unk> , why should I seek to make myself better than God ? ” “ Edmond , ” continued Mercédès , with her arms extended towards the count , “ since I first knew you , I have adored your name , have respected your memory .
Edmond , my friend , do not <unk> me to <unk> that noble and pure image reflected incessantly on the mirror of my heart .
Edmond , if you knew all the prayers I have addressed to God for you while I thought you were living and since I have thought you must be dead !
Yes , dead , alas !
I imagined your dead body buried at the foot of some gloomy tower , or cast to the bottom of a <unk> by <unk> <unk> , and I wept !
What could I do for you , Edmond , besides pray and weep ?
Listen ; for ten years I dreamed each night the same dream .
I had been told that you had endeavored to escape ; that you had taken the place of another prisoner ; that you had slipped into the <unk> sheet of a dead body ; that you had been thrown alive from the top of the Château d ’ If , and that the cry you uttered as you dashed upon the rocks first revealed to your <unk> that they were your <unk> .
Well , Edmond , I swear to you , by the head of that son for whom I entreat your pity , — Edmond , for ten years I saw every night every detail of that frightful tragedy , and for ten years I heard every night the cry which awoke me , shuddering and cold .
And I , too , Edmond — oh !
believe me — guilty as I was — oh , yes , I , too , have suffered much ! ” “ Have you known what it is to have your father <unk> to death in your absence ? ” cried Monte Cristo , <unk> his hands into his hair ; “ have you seen the woman you loved giving her hand to your <unk> , while you were <unk> at the bottom of a dungeon ? ” “ No , ” interrupted Mercédès , “ but I have seen him whom I loved on the point of <unk> my son . ” Mercédès uttered these words with such deep anguish , with an accent of such intense despair , that Monte Cristo could not restrain a sob .
The lion was <unk> ; the <unk> was conquered .
“ What do you ask of me ? ” said he , — “ your son ’ s life ?
Well , he shall live ! ” Mercédès uttered a cry which made the tears start from Monte Cristo ’ s eyes ; but these tears disappeared almost <unk> , for , doubtless , God had sent some angel to collect them — far more precious were they in his eyes than the <unk> pearls of <unk> and <unk> .
“ Oh , ” said she , seizing the count ’ s hand and raising it to her lips ; “ oh , thank you , thank you , Edmond !
Now you are exactly what I <unk> you were , — the man I always loved .
Oh , now I may say so ! ” “ So much the better , ” replied Monte Cristo ; “ as that poor Edmond will not have long to be loved by you .
Death is about to return to the tomb , the phantom to retire in darkness . ” “ What do you say , Edmond ? ” “ I say , since you command me , Mercédès , I must die . ” “ <unk> ?
and why so ?
Who <unk> of dying ?
<unk> have you these ideas of death ? ” “ You do not suppose that , <unk> <unk> in the face of a whole theatre , in the presence of your friends and those of your son — <unk> by a boy who will glory in my <unk> as if it were a victory — you do not suppose that I can for one moment wish to live .
What I most loved after you , Mercédès , was myself , my dignity , and that strength which rendered me superior to other men ; that strength was my life .
With one word you have crushed it , and I die . ” “ But the duel will not take place , Edmond , since you forgive ? ” “ It will take place , ” said Monte Cristo , in a most solemn tone ; “ but instead of your son ’ s blood to <unk> the ground , mine will flow . ” Mercédès <unk> , and sprang towards Monte Cristo , but , suddenly stopping , “ Edmond , ” said she , “ there is a God above us , since you live and since I have seen you again ; I trust to him from my heart .
While waiting his assistance I trust to your word ; you have said that my son should live , have you not ? ” “ Yes , madame , he shall live , ” said Monte Cristo , surprised that without more emotion Mercédès had accepted the heroic sacrifice he made for her .
Mercédès extended her hand to the count .
“ Edmond , ” said she , and her eyes were wet with tears while looking at him to whom she spoke , “ how noble it is of you , how great the action you have just performed , how sublime to have taken pity on a poor woman who <unk> to you with every chance against her , Alas , I am grown old with grief more than with years , and cannot now remind my Edmond by a smile , or by a look , of that Mercédès whom he once spent so many hours in <unk> .
Ah , believe me , Edmond , as I told you , I too have suffered much ; I repeat , it is melancholy to pass one ’ s life without having one joy to recall , without <unk> a single hope ; but that <unk> that all is not yet over .
No , it is not finished ; I feel it by what remains in my heart .
Oh , I repeat it , Edmond ; what you have just done is beautiful — it is grand ; it is sublime . ” “ Do you say so now , Mercédès ? — then what would you say if you knew the extent of the sacrifice I make to you ?
<unk> that the <unk> <unk> , after having created the world and <unk> <unk> , had paused in the work to spare an angel the tears that might one day flow for mortal sins from her <unk> eyes ; suppose that when everything was in readiness and the moment had come for God to look upon his work and see that it was good — suppose he had <unk> out the sun and tossed the world back into eternal night — then — even then , Mercédès , you could not imagine what I lose in <unk> my life at this moment . ” Mercédès looked at the count in a way which expressed at the same time her astonishment , her admiration , and her gratitude .
Monte Cristo pressed his forehead on his burning hands , as if his brain could no longer bear alone the weight of its thoughts .
“ Edmond , ” said Mercédès , “ I have but one word more to say to you . ” The count smiled bitterly .
“ Edmond , ” continued she , “ you will see that if my face is pale , if my eyes are dull , if my beauty is gone ; if Mercédès , in short , no longer resembles her former self in her features , you will see that her heart is still the same .
Adieu , then , Edmond ; I have nothing more to ask of heaven — I have seen you again , and have found you as noble and as great as formerly you were .
Adieu , Edmond , adieu , and thank you . ” But the count did not answer .
Mercédès opened the door of the study and had disappeared before he had recovered from the painful and profound reverie into which his <unk> vengeance had plunged him .
The clock of the <unk> struck one when the carriage which conveyed Madame de Morcerf rolled away on the pavement of the Champs-Élysées , and made Monte Cristo raise his head .
“ What a fool I was , ” said he , “ not to tear my heart out on the day when I resolved to <unk> myself ! ” Chapter <unk> .
The <unk> After Mercédès had left Monte Cristo , he fell into profound gloom .
<unk> him and within him the flight of thought seemed to have stopped ; his energetic mind <unk> , as the body does after extreme fatigue .
“ What ? ” said he to himself , while the lamp and the wax lights were nearly burnt out , and the servants were waiting impatiently in the <unk> ; “ what ?
this <unk> which I have been so long preparing , which I have <unk> with so much care and toil , is to be crushed by a single touch , a word , a breath !
Yes , this self , of whom I thought so much , of whom I was so proud , who had appeared so <unk> in the <unk> of the Château d ’ If , and whom I had succeeded in making so great , will be but a <unk> of <unk> tomorrow .
Alas , it is not the death of the body I regret ; for is not the destruction of the <unk> principle , the repose to which everything is <unk> , to which every unhappy being <unk> , — is not this the repose of matter after which I so long sighed , and which I was seeking to <unk> by the painful process of <unk> when Faria appeared in my dungeon ?
What is death for me ?
One step farther into rest , — two , perhaps , into silence .
No , it is not existence , then , that I regret , but the ruin of projects so slowly carried out , so <unk> <unk> .
Providence is now opposed to them , when I most thought it would be <unk> .
It is not God ’ s will that they should be accomplished .
This burden , almost as heavy as a world , which I had raised , and I had thought to bear to the end , was too great for my strength , and I was compelled to lay it down in the middle of my career .
Oh , shall I then , again become a <unk> , whom fourteen years of despair and ten of hope had rendered a <unk> in Providence ?
“ And all this — all this , because my heart , which I thought dead , was only sleeping ; because it has awakened and has begun to beat again , because I have yielded to the pain of the emotion excited in my breast by a woman ’ s voice .
“ Yet , ” continued the count , becoming each moment more absorbed in the <unk> of the dreadful sacrifice for the morrow , which Mercédès had accepted , “ yet , it is impossible that so <unk> a woman should thus through selfishness consent to my death when I am in the <unk> of life and strength ; it is impossible that she can carry to such a point <unk> love , or rather delirium .
There are virtues which become crimes by <unk> .
No , she must have conceived some <unk> scene ; she will come and throw herself between us ; and what would be sublime here will there appear ridiculous . ” The blush of pride mounted to the count ’ s forehead as this thought passed through his mind .
“ <unk> ? ” repeated he ; “ and the <unk> will fall on me .
I ridiculous ?
No , I would rather die . ” By thus <unk> to his own mind the anticipated <unk> of the next day , to which he had condemned himself by <unk> Mercédès to spare her son , the count at last exclaimed : “ <unk> , folly , folly ! — to carry <unk> so far as to put myself up as a mark for that young man to aim at .
He will never believe that my death was suicide ; and yet it is important for the honor of my memory , — and this surely is not vanity , but a <unk> pride , — it is important the world should know that I have <unk> , by my free will , to stop my arm , already raised to strike , and that with the arm which has been so powerful against others I have struck myself .
It must be ; it shall be . ” <unk> a pen , he drew a paper from a secret drawer in his desk , and wrote at the bottom of the <unk> ( which was no other than his will , made since his arrival in Paris ) a sort of <unk> , clearly <unk> the nature of his death .
“ I do this , Oh , my God , ” said he , with his eyes raised to heaven , “ as much for thy honor as for mine .
I have during ten years considered myself the agent of thy vengeance , and other <unk> , like Morcerf , Danglars , Villefort , even Morcerf himself , must not imagine that chance has <unk> them from their enemy .
Let them know , on the contrary , that their punishment , which had been <unk> by Providence , is only delayed by my present determination , and although they escape it in this world , it <unk> them in another , and that they are only <unk> time for eternity . ” While he was thus agitated by gloomy <unk> , — wretched waking dreams of grief , — the first rays of morning pierced his windows , and shone upon the pale blue paper on which he had just <unk> his <unk> of Providence .
It was just five o ’ clock in the morning when a slight noise like a stifled sigh reached his ear .
He turned his head , looked around him , and saw no one ; but the sound was repeated distinctly enough to convince him of its reality .
He arose , and quietly opening the door of the drawing-room , saw Haydée , who had fallen on a chair , with her arms hanging down and her beautiful head thrown back .
She had been standing at the door , to prevent his going out without seeing her , until sleep , which the young cannot resist , had <unk> her frame , <unk> as she was with watching .
The noise of the door did not <unk> her , and Monte Cristo gazed at her with affectionate regret .
“ She remembered that she had a son , ” said he ; “ and I forgot I had a daughter . ” Then , shaking his head <unk> , “ Poor Haydée , ” said he ; “ she wished to see me , to speak to me ; she has feared or guessed something .
Oh , I cannot go without taking leave of her ; I cannot die without <unk> her to someone . ” He quietly regained his seat , and wrote under the other lines : “ I <unk> to Maximilian Morrel , captain of <unk> , — and son of my former patron , <unk> Morrel , <unk> at Marseilles , — the sum of twenty millions , a part of which may be offered to his sister Julie and <unk> Emmanuel , if he does not fear this increase of fortune may <unk> their happiness .
These twenty millions are concealed in my grotto at Monte Cristo , of which Bertuccio knows the secret .
If his heart is free , and he will marry Haydée , the daughter of Ali <unk> of Yanina , whom I have brought up with the love of a father , and who has shown the love and tenderness of a daughter for me , he will thus accomplish my last wish .
This will has already constituted Haydée <unk> of the rest of my fortune , <unk> of <unk> , <unk> in England , <unk> , and <unk> , furniture in my different <unk> and houses , and which without the twenty millions and the <unk> to my servants , may still amount to sixty millions . ” <unk> He was <unk> the last line when a cry behind him made him start , and the pen fell from his hand .
“ Haydée , ” said he , “ did you read it ? ” “ Oh , my lord , ” said she , “ why are you writing thus at such an hour ?
Why are you <unk> all your fortune to me ?
Are you going to leave me ? ” “ I am going on a journey , dear child , ” said Monte Cristo , with an expression of infinite tenderness and melancholy ; “ and if any misfortune should happen to me — — ” The count stopped .
“ Well ? ” asked the young girl , with an <unk> tone the count had never observed before , and which startled him .
“ Well , if any misfortune happen to me , ” replied Monte Cristo , “ I wish my daughter to be happy . ” Haydée smiled <unk> , and shook her head .
“ Do you think of dying , my lord ? ” said she .
“ The wise man , my child , has said , ‘ It is good to think of death . ’ ” “ Well , if you die , ” said she , “ <unk> your fortune to others , for if you die I shall require nothing ; ” and , taking the paper , she tore it in four pieces , and threw it into the middle of the room .
Then , the effort having exhausted her strength , she fell , not asleep this time , but <unk> on the floor .
The count leaned over her and raised her in his arms ; and seeing that sweet pale face , those lovely eyes closed , that beautiful form motionless and to all appearance <unk> , the idea occurred to him for the first time , that perhaps she loved him otherwise than as a daughter loves a father .
“ Alas , ” murmured he , with intense suffering , “ I might , then , have been happy yet . ” Then he carried Haydée to her room , resigned her to the care of her attendants , and returning to his study , which he shut quickly this time , he again copied the destroyed will .
As he was <unk> , the sound of a cabriolet entering the yard was heard .
Monte Cristo approached the window , and saw Maximilian and Emmanuel <unk> .
“ Good , ” said he ; “ it was time , ” — and he sealed his will with three <unk> .
A moment afterwards he heard a noise in the drawing-room , and went to open the door himself .
Morrel was there ; he had come twenty minutes before the time appointed .
“ I am perhaps come too soon , count , ” said he , “ but I <unk> acknowledge that I have not closed my eyes all night , nor has anyone in my house .
I need to see you strong in your <unk> assurance , to recover myself . ” Monte Cristo could not resist this proof of affection ; he not only extended his hand to the young man , but flew to him with open arms .
“ Morrel , ” said he , “ it is a happy day for me , to feel that I am beloved by such a man as you .
<unk> , Emmanuel ; you will come with me then , Maximilian ? ” “ Did you doubt it ? ” said the young captain .
“ But if I were wrong — — ” “ I watched you during the whole scene of that <unk> yesterday ; I have been thinking of your <unk> all night , and I said to myself that justice must be on your side , or man ’ s countenance is no longer to be <unk> on . ” “ But , Morrel , Albert is your friend ? ” “ <unk> an acquaintance , sir . ” “ You met on the same day you first saw me ? ” “ Yes , that is true ; but I should not have recollected it if you had not reminded me . ” “ Thank you , Morrel . ” Then <unk> the bell once , “ Look . ” said he to Ali , who came immediately , “ take that to my <unk> .
It is my will , Morrel .
When I am dead , you will go and examine it . ” “ What ? ” said Morrel , “ you dead ? ” “ Yes ; must I not be prepared for everything , dear friend ?
But what did you do yesterday after you left me ? ” “ I went to <unk> ’ s , where , as I expected , I found Beauchamp and Château-Renaud .
I own I was seeking them . ” “ Why , when all was arranged ? ” “ Listen , count ; the affair is serious and <unk> . ” “ Did you doubt it ! ” “ No ; the offence was public , and everyone is already talking of it . ” “ Well ? ” “ Well , I hoped to get an exchange of arms , — to <unk> the sword for the pistol ; the pistol is blind . ” “ Have you succeeded ? ” asked Monte Cristo quickly , with an imperceptible gleam of hope .
“ No ; for your skill with the sword is so well known . ” “ Ah ? — who has betrayed me ? ” “ The skilful <unk> whom you have conquered . ” “ And you failed ? ” “ They positively refused . ” “ Morrel , ” said the count , “ have you ever seen me fire a pistol ? ” “ Never . ” “ Well , we have time ; look . ” Monte Cristo took the pistols he held in his hand when Mercédès entered , and fixing an <unk> of <unk> against the iron plate , with four <unk> he <unk> shot off the four sides of the club .
At each shot Morrel turned pale .
He examined the bullets with which Monte Cristo performed this <unk> <unk> , and saw that they were no larger than <unk> .
“ It is astonishing , ” said he .
“ Look , Emmanuel . ” Then turning towards Monte Cristo , “ Count , ” said he , “ in the name of all that is dear to you , I entreat you not to kill Albert ! — the unhappy youth has a mother . ” “ You are right , ” said Monte Cristo ; “ and I have none . ” These words were uttered in a tone which made Morrel shudder .
“ You are the offended party , count . ” “ <unk> ; what does that <unk> ? ” “ That you will fire first . ” “ I fire first ? ” “ Oh , I obtained , or rather <unk> that ; we had <unk> enough for them to yield us that . ” “ And at what distance ? ” “ <unk> paces . ” A smile of terrible <unk> passed over the count ’ s lips .
“ Morrel , ” said he , “ do not forget what you have just seen . ” “ The only chance for Albert ’ s safety , then , will arise from your emotion . ” “ I suffer from emotion ? ” said Monte Cristo .
“ Or from your <unk> , my friend ; to so good a <unk> as you are , I may say what would appear absurd to another . ” “ What is that ? ” “ <unk> his arm — wound him — but do not kill him . ” “ I will tell you , Morrel , ” said the count , “ that I do not need <unk> to spare the life of M. de Morcerf ; he shall be so well spared , that he will return quietly with his two friends , while I — — ” “ And you ? ” “ That will be another thing ; I shall be brought home . ” “ No , no , ” cried Maximilian , quite unable to restrain his feelings .
“ As I told you , my dear Morrel , M. de Morcerf will kill me . ” Morrel looked at him in utter amazement .
“ But what has happened , then , since last evening , count ? ” “ The same thing that happened to <unk> the night before the battle of <unk> ; I have seen a <unk> . ” “ And that <unk> — — ” “ <unk> me , Morrel , that I had lived long enough . ” Maximilian and Emmanuel looked at each other .
Monte Cristo drew out his watch .
“ Let us go , ” said he ; “ it is five minutes past seven , and the <unk> was for eight o ’ clock . ” A carriage was in readiness at the door .
Monte Cristo stepped into it with his two friends .
He had stopped a moment in the passage to listen at a door , and Maximilian and Emmanuel , who had <unk> passed forward a few steps , thought they heard him answer by a sigh to a sob from within .
As the clock struck eight they drove up to the place of meeting .
“ We are first , ” said Morrel , looking out of the window .
“ Excuse me , sir , ” said Baptistin , who had followed his master with indescribable terror , “ but I think I see a carriage down there under the trees . ” Monte Cristo sprang lightly from the carriage , and offered his hand to assist Emmanuel and Maximilian .
The latter retained the count ’ s hand between his .
“ I like , ” said he , “ to feel a hand like this , when its owner <unk> on the goodness of his cause . ” “ It seems to me , ” said Emmanuel , “ that I see two young men down there , who are evidently , waiting . ” Monte Cristo drew Morrel a step or two behind his <unk> .
“ Maximilian , ” said he , “ are your affections <unk> ? ” Morrel looked at Monte Cristo with astonishment .
“ I do not seek your confidence , my dear friend .
I only ask you a simple question ; answer it ; — that is all I require . ” “ I love a young girl , count . ” “ Do you love her much ? ” “ More than my life . ” “ Another hope <unk> ! ” said the count .
Then , with a sigh , “ Poor Haydée ! ” murmured he .
“ To tell the truth , count , if I knew less of you , I should think that you were less brave than you are . ” “ Because I sigh when thinking of someone I am leaving ?
Come , Morrel , it is not like a soldier to be so bad a judge of courage .
Do I regret life ?
What is it to me , who have passed twenty years between life and death ?
Moreover , do not alarm yourself , Morrel ; this weakness , if it is such , is betrayed to you alone .
I know the world is a drawing-room , from which we must retire <unk> and <unk> ; that is , with a bow , and our debts of honor paid . ” “ That is to the purpose .
Have you brought your arms ? ” “ I ? — what for ?
I hope these gentlemen have <unk> . ” “ I will inquire , ” said Morrel .
“ Do ; but make no <unk> — you understand me ? ” “ You need not fear . ” Morrel advanced towards Beauchamp and Château-Renaud , who , seeing his intention , came to meet him .
The three young men bowed to each other <unk> , if not <unk> .
“ Excuse me , gentlemen , ” said Morrel , “ but I do not see M. de Morcerf . ” “ He sent us word this morning , ” replied Château-Renaud , “ that he would meet us on the ground . ” “ Ah , ” said Morrel .
Beauchamp pulled out his watch .
“ It is only five minutes past eight , ” said he to Morrel ; “ there is not much time lost yet . ” “ Oh , I made no allusion of that kind , ” replied Morrel .
“ There is a carriage coming , ” said Château-Renaud .
It advanced rapidly along one of the <unk> leading towards the open space where they were assembled .
“ You are doubtless provided with pistols , gentlemen ?
M. de Monte Cristo <unk> his right of using his . ” “ We had anticipated this kindness on the part of the count , ” said Beauchamp , “ and I have brought some weapons which I bought eight or ten days since , thinking to want them on a similar occasion .
They are quite new , and have not yet been used .
Will you examine them . ” “ Oh , M. Beauchamp , if you assure me that M. de Morcerf does not know these pistols , you may readily believe that your word will be quite sufficient . ” “ Gentlemen , ” said Château-Renaud , “ it is not Morcerf coming in that carriage ; — faith , it is Franz and Debray ! ” The two young men he announced were indeed approaching .
“ What chance brings you here , gentlemen ? ” said Château-Renaud , shaking hands with each of them .
“ Because , ” said Debray , “ Albert sent this morning to request us to come . ” Beauchamp and Château-Renaud exchanged looks of astonishment .
“ I think I understand his reason , ” said Morrel .
“ What is it ? ” “ <unk> afternoon I received a letter from M. de Morcerf , <unk> me to attend the Opera . ” “ And I , ” said Debray .
“ And I also , ” said Franz .
“ And we , too , ” added Beauchamp and Château-Renaud .
“ Having wished you all to witness the <unk> , he now wishes you to be present at the combat . ” “ Exactly so , ” said the young men ; “ you have probably guessed right . ” “ But , after all these arrangements , he does not come himself , ” said Château-Renaud .
“ Albert is ten minutes after time . ” “ There he comes , ” said Beauchamp , “ on horseback , at full <unk> , followed by a servant . ” “ How imprudent , ” said Château-Renaud , “ to come on horseback to fight a duel with pistols , after all the instructions I had given him . ” “ And besides , ” said Beauchamp , “ with a collar above his cravat , an open coat and white waistcoat !
Why has he not painted a spot upon his heart ? — it would have been more simple . ” Meanwhile Albert had arrived within ten paces of the group formed by the five young men .
He jumped from his horse , threw the <unk> on his servant ’ s arms , and joined them .
He was pale , and his eyes were red and <unk> ; it was evident that he had not slept .
A shade of melancholy gravity <unk> his countenance , which was not natural to him .
“ I thank you , gentlemen , ” said he , “ for having <unk> with my request ; I feel extremely grateful for this mark of friendship . ” Morrel had stepped back as Morcerf approached , and remained at a short distance .
“ And to you also , M. Morrel , my thanks are due .
Come , there cannot be too many . ” <unk> “ Sir , ” said Maximilian , “ you are not perhaps aware that I am M. de Monte Cristo ’ s friend ? ” “ I was not sure , but I thought it might be so .
So much the better ; the more honorable men there are here the better I shall be satisfied . ” “ M.
Morrel , ” said Château-Renaud , “ will you <unk> the Count of Monte Cristo that M. de Morcerf is arrived , and we are at his disposal ? ” Morrel was preparing to fulfil his commission .
Beauchamp had meanwhile drawn the box of pistols from the carriage .
“ Stop , gentlemen , ” said Albert ; “ I have two words to say to the Count of Monte Cristo . ” “ In private ? ” asked Morrel .
“ No , sir ; before all who are here . ” Albert ’ s witnesses looked at each other .
Franz and Debray exchanged some words in a whisper , and Morrel , rejoiced at this unexpected incident , went to fetch the count , who was walking in a retired path with Emmanuel .
“ What does he want with me ? ” said Monte Cristo .
“ I do not know , but he wishes to speak to you . ” “ Ah ? ” said Monte Cristo , “ I trust he is not going to <unk> me by some fresh insult ! ” “ I do not think that such is his intention , ” said Morrel .
The count advanced , accompanied by Maximilian and Emmanuel .
His calm and serene look formed a singular contrast to Albert ’ s <unk> face , who approached also , followed by the other four young men .
When at three paces distant from each other , Albert and the count stopped .
“ <unk> , gentlemen , ” said Albert ; “ I wish you not to lose one word of what I am about to have the honor of saying to the Count of Monte Cristo , for it must be repeated by you to all who will listen to it , strange as it may appear to you . ” “ <unk> , sir , ” said the count .
“ Sir , ” said Albert , at first with a <unk> voice , but which gradually became <unk> , “ I <unk> you with <unk> the conduct of M. de Morcerf in <unk> , for guilty as I knew he was , I thought you had no right to <unk> him ; but I have since learned that you had that right .
It is not Fernand <unk> ’ s <unk> towards Ali <unk> which <unk> me so readily to excuse you , but the <unk> of the <unk> Fernand towards you , and the almost <unk> miseries which were its <unk> ; and I say , and <unk> it <unk> , that you were <unk> in <unk> yourself on my father , and I , his son , thank you for not using greater severity . ” Had a <unk> fallen in the midst of the spectators of this unexpected scene , it would not have surprised them more than did Albert ’ s declaration .
As for Monte Cristo , his eyes slowly rose towards heaven with an expression of infinite gratitude .
He could not understand how Albert ’ s <unk> nature , of which he had seen so much among the Roman bandits , had suddenly <unk> to this <unk> .
He recognized the influence of Mercédès , and saw why her noble heart had not opposed the sacrifice she knew beforehand would be useless .
“ Now , sir , ” said Albert , “ if you think my <unk> sufficient , pray give me your hand .
<unk> to the merit of <unk> which you appear to possess , I rank that of <unk> <unk> a fault .
But this confession concerns me only .
I acted well as a man , but you have acted better than man .
An angel alone could have saved one of us from death — that angel came from heaven , if not to make us friends ( which , alas , fatality renders impossible ) , at least to make us esteem each other . ” Monte Cristo , with <unk> eye , <unk> breast , and lips half open , extended to Albert a hand which the latter pressed with a sentiment resembling respectful fear .
“ Gentlemen , ” said he , “ M.
de Monte Cristo <unk> my <unk> .
I had acted hastily towards him .
<unk> actions are generally bad ones .
Now my fault is <unk> .
I hope the world will not call me <unk> for acting as my conscience <unk> .
But if anyone should entertain a false opinion of me , ” added he , drawing himself up as if he would <unk> both friends and enemies , “ I shall endeavor to correct his mistake . ” “ What happened during the night ? ” asked Beauchamp of Château-Renaud ; “ we appear to make a very sorry figure here . ” “ In truth , what Albert has just done is either very <unk> or very noble , ” replied the baron .
“ What can it mean ? ” said Debray to Franz .
“ The Count of Monte Cristo <unk> <unk> to M. de Morcerf , and is <unk> by his son !
Had I ten <unk> in my family , I should only consider myself the more bound to fight ten times . ” As for Monte Cristo , his head was bent down , his arms were <unk> .
<unk> under the weight of <unk> years ’ <unk> , he thought not of Albert , of Beauchamp , of Château-Renaud , or of any of that group ; but he thought of that <unk> woman who had come to <unk> for her son ’ s life , to whom he had offered his , and who had now saved it by the <unk> of a dreadful family secret , capable of <unk> forever in that young man ’ s heart every feeling of <unk> <unk> .
“ Providence still , ” murmured he ; “ now only am I fully convinced of being the <unk> of God ! ” Chapter <unk> .
Mother and <unk> The Count of Monte Cristo bowed to the five young men with a melancholy and <unk> smile , and got into his carriage with Maximilian and Emmanuel .
Albert , Beauchamp , and Château-Renaud remained alone .
Albert looked at his two friends , not <unk> , but in a way that appeared to ask their opinion of what he had just done .
“ Indeed , my dear friend , ” said Beauchamp first , who had either the most feeling or the least <unk> , “ allow me to congratulate you ; this is a very <unk> conclusion of a very disagreeable affair . ” Albert remained silent and wrapped in thought .
Château-Renaud contented himself with <unk> his <unk> with his <unk> cane .
“ Are we not going ? ” said he , after this <unk> silence .
“ When you please , ” replied Beauchamp ; “ allow me only to compliment M. de Morcerf , who has given proof today of rare <unk> <unk> . ” “ Oh , yes , ” said Château-Renaud .
“ It is magnificent , ” continued Beauchamp , “ to be able to exercise so much <unk> ! ” “ <unk> ; as for me , I should have been incapable of it , ” said Château-Renaud , with most significant coolness .
“ Gentlemen , ” interrupted Albert , “ I think you did not understand that something very serious had passed between M. de Monte Cristo and myself . ” “ <unk> , possibly , ” said Beauchamp immediately ; “ but every <unk> would not be able to understand your <unk> , and sooner or later you will find yourself compelled to explain it to them more <unk> than would be convenient to your <unk> health and the <unk> of your life .
May I give you a friendly counsel ?
<unk> out for Naples , the <unk> , or St. <unk> — calm countries , where the point of honor is better understood than among our <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> and <unk> , so that you may return <unk> to France after a few years .
Am I not right , M. de Château-Renaud ? ” <unk> “ That is quite my opinion , ” said the gentleman ; “ nothing <unk> serious <unk> so much as a duel <unk> . ” “ Thank you , gentlemen , ” replied Albert , with a smile of indifference ; “ I shall follow your advice — not because you give it , but because I had before intended to quit France .
I thank you equally for the service you have rendered me in being my seconds .
It is deeply <unk> on my heart , and , after what you have just said , I remember that only . ” Château-Renaud and Beauchamp looked at each other ; the impression was the same on both of them , and the tone in which Morcerf had just expressed his thanks was so determined that the position would have become <unk> for all if the conversation had continued .
“ Good-bye , Albert , ” said Beauchamp suddenly , <unk> extending his hand to the young man .
The latter did not appear to <unk> from his <unk> ; in fact , he did not notice the offered hand .
“ Good-bye , ” said Château-Renaud in his turn , keeping his little cane in his left hand , and <unk> with his right .
Albert ’ s lips scarcely whispered “ Good-bye , ” but his look was more <unk> ; it expressed a whole <unk> of restrained anger , proud disdain , and generous indignation .
He preserved his melancholy and motionless position for some time after his two friends had regained their carriage ; then suddenly <unk> his horse from the little tree to which his servant had tied it , he mounted and <unk> off in the direction of Paris .
In a quarter of an hour he was entering the house in the Rue du <unk> .
As he <unk> , he thought he saw his father ’ s pale face behind the curtain of the count ’ s bedroom .
Albert turned away his head with a sigh , and went to his own apartments .
He cast one <unk> look on all the <unk> which had rendered life so easy and so happy since his <unk> ; he looked at the <unk> , whose faces seemed to smile , and the <unk> , which appeared painted in <unk> colors .
Then he took away his mother ’ s portrait , with its <unk> frame , leaving the <unk> frame from which he took it black and empty .
Then he arranged all his beautiful <unk> arms , his fine English guns , his <unk> <unk> , his <unk> mounted in silver , his <unk> <unk> by <unk> or <unk> ; examined the <unk> , and placed the key in each ; threw into a drawer of his <unk> , which he left open , all the <unk> he had about him , and with it the thousand fancy jewels from his <unk> and his <unk> ; then he made an exact <unk> of everything , and placed it in the most <unk> part of the table , after putting aside the books and papers which had collected there .
At the beginning of this work , his servant , notwithstanding orders to the contrary , came to his room .
“ What do you want ? ” asked he , with a more sorrowful than angry tone .
“ Pardon me , sir , ” replied the valet ; “ you had forbidden me to disturb you , but the Count of Morcerf has called me . ” “ Well ! ” said Albert .
“ I did not like to go to him without first seeing you . ” “ Why ? ” “ Because the count is doubtless aware that I accompanied you to the meeting this morning . ” <unk> “ It is probable , ” said Albert .
“ And since he has sent for me , it is doubtless to question me on what happened there .
What must I answer ? ” “ The truth . ” “ Then I shall say the duel did not take place ? ” “ You will say I <unk> to the Count of Monte Cristo .
Go . ” The valet bowed and retired , and Albert returned to his <unk> .
As he was <unk> this work , the sound of horses <unk> in the yard , and the wheels of a carriage shaking his window , attracted his attention .
He approached the window , and saw his father get into it , and drive away .
The door was scarcely closed when Albert bent his steps to his mother ’ s room ; and , no one being there to announce him , he advanced to her <unk> , and distressed by what he saw and guessed , stopped for one moment at the door .
As if the same idea had animated these two beings , Mercédès was doing the same in her apartments that he had just done in his .
Everything was in order , — <unk> , <unk> , jewels , linen , money , all were arranged in the <unk> , and the countess was carefully collecting the keys .
Albert saw all these <unk> and understood them , and <unk> , “ My mother ! ” he threw his arms around her neck .
The artist who could have <unk> the expression of these two <unk> would certainly have made of them a beautiful picture .
All these proofs of an energetic resolution , which Albert did not fear on his own account , alarmed him for his mother .
“ What are you doing ? ” asked he .
“ What were you doing ? ” replied she .
“ Oh , my mother ! ” exclaimed Albert , so overcome he could scarcely speak ; “ it is not the same with you and me — you cannot have made the same resolution I have , for I have come to warn you that I <unk> adieu to your house , and — and to you . ” “ I also , ” replied Mercédès , “ am going , and I acknowledge I had depended on your <unk> me ; have I deceived myself ? ” “ Mother , ” said Albert with <unk> .
“ I cannot make you share the fate I have <unk> for myself .
I must live henceforth without rank and fortune , and to begin this hard <unk> I must <unk> from a friend the <unk> I shall eat until I have earned one .
So , my dear mother , I am going at once to ask Franz to lend me the small sum I shall require to supply my present wants . ” “ You , my poor child , suffer poverty and hunger ?
Oh , do not say so ; it will break my <unk> . ” “ But not mine , mother , ” replied Albert .
“ I am young and strong ; I believe I am <unk> , and since yesterday I have learned the power of will .
Alas , my dear mother , some have suffered so much , and yet live , and have raised a new fortune on the ruin of all the promises of happiness which heaven had made them — on the <unk> of all the hope which God had given them !
I have seen that , mother ; I know that from the gulf in which their enemies have plunged them they have risen with so much <unk> and glory that in their turn they have <unk> their former <unk> , and have punished them .
No , mother ; from this moment I have done with the past , and accept nothing from it — not even a name , because you can understand that your son cannot bear the name of a man who ought to blush for it before another . ” “ Albert , my child , ” said Mercédès , “ if I had a stronger heart , that is the counsel I would have given you ; your conscience has spoken when my voice became too weak ; listen to its <unk> .
You had friends , Albert ; break off their acquaintance .
But do not despair ; you have life before you , my dear Albert , for you are yet scarcely <unk> years old ; and as a pure heart like yours wants a <unk> name , take my father ’ s — it was <unk> .
I am sure , my dear Albert , whatever may be your career , you will soon render that name illustrious .
Then , my son , return to the world still more brilliant because of your former sorrows ; and if I am wrong , still let me <unk> these hopes , for I have no future to look forward to .
For me the grave opens when I pass the threshold of this house . ” “ I will fulfil all your wishes , my dear mother , ” said the young man .
“ Yes , I share your hopes ; the anger of Heaven will not pursue us , since you are pure and I am innocent .
But , since our resolution is formed , let us act <unk> .
M. de Morcerf went out about half an hour ago ; the opportunity is favorable to avoid an explanation . ” “ I am ready , my son , ” said Mercédès .
Albert ran to fetch a carriage .
He recollected that there was a small furnished house to let in the Rue des <unk> , where his mother would find a humble but <unk> <unk> , and thither he intended <unk> the countess .
As the carriage stopped at the door , and Albert was <unk> , a man approached and gave him a letter .
Albert recognized the <unk> .
“ From the count , ” said Bertuccio .
Albert took the letter , opened , and read it , then looked round for Bertuccio , but he was gone .
He returned to Mercédès with tears in his eyes and <unk> breast , and without uttering a word he gave her the letter .
Mercédès read : “ Albert , — While showing you that I have discovered your plans , I hope also to convince you of my delicacy .
You are free , you leave the count ’ s house , and you take your mother to your home ; but reflect , Albert , you owe her more than your poor noble heart can pay her .
<unk> the struggle for yourself , bear all the suffering , but spare her the trial of poverty which must accompany your first efforts ; for she <unk> not even the shadow of the misfortune which has this day fallen on her , and Providence is not willing that the innocent should suffer for the guilty .
I know you are going to leave the Rue du <unk> without taking anything with you .
Do not seek to know how I discovered it ; I know it — that is sufficient .
“ Now , listen , Albert .
<unk> years ago I returned , proud and <unk> , to my country .
I had a betrothed , Albert , a lovely girl whom I adored , and I was bringing to my betrothed a hundred and fifty louis , <unk> <unk> by <unk> toil .
This money was for her ; I destined it for her , and , knowing the <unk> of the sea I buried our treasure in the little garden of the house my father lived in at Marseilles , on the <unk> de <unk> .
Your mother , Albert , knows that poor house well .
A short time since I passed through Marseilles , and went to see the old place , which <unk> so many painful recollections ; and in the evening I took a <unk> and dug in the corner of the garden where I had concealed my treasure .
The iron box was there — no one had touched it — under a beautiful <unk> my father had planted the day I was born , which <unk> the spot .
Well , Albert , this money , which was formerly <unk> to <unk> the comfort and tranquillity of the woman I adored , may now , through strange and painful circumstances , be devoted to the same purpose .
“ Oh , feel for me , who could offer millions to that poor woman , but who return her only the piece of black bread forgotten under my poor roof since the day I was torn from her I loved .
You are a generous man , Albert , but perhaps you may be <unk> by pride or resentment ; if you refuse me , if you ask another for what I have a right to offer you , I will say it is <unk> of you to refuse the life of your mother at the hands of a man whose father was allowed by your father to die in all the horrors of poverty and despair . ” Albert stood pale and motionless to hear what his mother would decide after she had finished reading this letter .
Mercédès turned her eyes with an ineffable look towards heaven .
“ I accept it , ” said she ; “ he has a right to pay the <unk> , which I shall take with me to some convent ! ” <unk> the letter in her bosom , she took her son ’ s arm , and with a <unk> step than she even herself expected she went downstairs .
Chapter <unk> .
The <unk> Meanwhile Monte Cristo had also returned to town with Emmanuel and Maximilian .
Their return was cheerful .
Emmanuel did not conceal his joy at the peaceful <unk> of the affair , and was loud in his expressions of delight .
Morrel , in a corner of the carriage , allowed his <unk> ’ s gayety to <unk> itself in words , while he felt equal inward joy , which , however , betrayed itself only in his countenance .
At the Barrière du <unk> they met Bertuccio , who was waiting there , motionless as a sentinel at his post .
Monte Cristo put his head out of the window , exchanged a few words with him in a low tone , and the steward disappeared .
“ Count , ” said Emmanuel , when they were at the end of the Place <unk> , “ put me down at my door , that my wife may not have a single moment of <unk> anxiety on my account or yours . ” “ If it were not ridiculous to make a display of our triumph , said Morrel , I would invite the count to our house ; besides that , he doubtless has some trembling heart to comfort .
So we will take leave of our friend , and let him hasten home . ” “ Stop a moment , ” said Monte Cristo ; “ do not let me lose both my companions .
<unk> , Emmanuel , to your charming wife , and present my best compliments to her ; and do you , Morrel , accompany me to the Champs-Élysées . ” “ <unk> , ” said Maximilian ; “ particularly as I have business in that quarter . ” “ Shall we wait breakfast for you ? ” asked Emmanuel .
“ No , ” replied the young man .
The door was closed , and the carriage proceeded .
“ See what good fortune I brought you ! ” said Morrel , when he was alone with the count .
“ Have you not thought so ? ” “ Yes , ” said Monte Cristo ; “ for that reason I wished to keep you near me . ” “ It is <unk> ! ” continued Morrel , answering his own thoughts .
“ What ? ” said Monte Cristo .
“ What has just happened . ” “ Yes , ” said the Count , “ you are right — it is <unk> . ” “ For Albert is brave , ” resumed Morrel .
“ Very brave , ” said Monte Cristo ; “ I have seen him sleep with a sword suspended over his head . ” “ And I know he has fought two <unk> , ” said Morrel .
“ How can you <unk> that with his conduct this morning ? ” “ All owing to your influence , ” replied Monte Cristo , smiling .
“ It is well for Albert he is not in the army , ” said Morrel .
“ Why ? ” “ An <unk> on the ground ! ” said the young captain , shaking his head .
“ Come , ” said the count <unk> , “ do not entertain the prejudices of ordinary men , Morrel !
<unk> , that if Albert is brave , he cannot be a coward ; he must then have had some reason for acting as he did this morning , and confess that his conduct is more heroic than otherwise . ” “ <unk> , doubtless , ” said Morrel ; “ but I shall say , like the <unk> , ‘ He has not been so brave today as he was yesterday . ’ ” “ You will breakfast with me , will you not , Morrel ? ” said the count , to turn the conversation .
“ No ; I must leave you at ten o ’ clock . ” “ Your engagement was for breakfast , then ? ” said the count .
Morrel smiled , and shook his head .
“ Still you must breakfast somewhere . ” “ But if I am not hungry ? ” said the young man .
“ Oh , ” said the count , “ I only know two things which destroy the appetite , — grief — and as I am happy to see you very cheerful , it is not that — and love .
Now after what you told me this morning of your heart , I may believe — — ” “ Well , count , ” replied Morrel <unk> , “ I will not <unk> it . ” “ But you will not make me your <unk> , Maximilian ? ” said the count , in a tone which showed how <unk> he would have been admitted to the secret .
“ I showed you this morning that I had a heart , did I not , count ? ” Monte Cristo only answered by extending his hand to the young man .
“ Well , ” continued the latter , “ since that heart is no longer with you in the <unk> de <unk> , it is elsewhere , and I must go and find it . ” “ Go , ” said the count <unk> ; “ go , dear friend , but promise me if you meet with any obstacle to remember that I have some power in this world , that I am happy to use that power in the <unk> of those I love , and that I love you , Morrel . ” <unk> “ I will remember it , ” said the young man , “ as selfish children recollect their parents when they want their aid .
When I need your assistance , and the moment arrives , I will come to you , count . ” “ Well , I rely upon your promise .
Good-bye , then . ” “ Good-bye , till we meet again . ” They had arrived in the Champs-Élysées .
Monte Cristo opened the <unk> , Morrel sprang out on the pavement , Bertuccio was waiting on the steps .
Morrel disappeared down the <unk> de <unk> , and Monte Cristo hastened to join Bertuccio .
“ Well ? ” asked he .
“ She is going to leave her house , ” said the steward .
“ And her son ? ” “ <unk> , his valet , thinks he is going to do the same . ” “ Come this way . ” Monte Cristo took Bertuccio into his study , wrote the letter we have seen , and gave it to the steward .
“ Go , ” said he quickly .
“ But first , let Haydée be informed that I have returned . ” “ Here I am , ” said the young girl , who at the sound of the carriage had run downstairs and whose face was radiant with joy at seeing the count return safely .
Bertuccio left .
Every <unk> of a daughter finding a father , all the delight of a mistress seeing an adored lover , were felt by Haydée during the first moments of this meeting , which she had so eagerly expected .
<unk> , although less evident , Monte Cristo ’ s joy was not less intense .
<unk> to hearts which have suffered long is like the <unk> on the ground after a long <unk> ; both the heart and the ground <unk> that <unk> <unk> falling on them , and nothing is <unk> apparent .
Monte Cristo was beginning to think , what he had not for a long time dared to believe , that there were two Mercédès in the world , and he might yet be happy .
His eye , <unk> with happiness , was reading eagerly the <unk> gaze of Haydée , when suddenly the door opened .
The count <unk> his brow .
“ M.
de Morcerf ! ” said Baptistin , as if that name sufficed for his excuse .
In fact , the count ’ s face <unk> .
“ Which , ” asked he , “ the viscount or the count ? ” “ The count . ” “ Oh , ” exclaimed Haydée , “ is it not yet over ? ” “ I know not if it is finished , my beloved child , ” said Monte Cristo , taking the young girl ’ s hands ; “ but I do know you have nothing more to fear . ” “ But it is the wretched — — ” “ That man cannot <unk> me , Haydée , ” said Monte Cristo ; “ it was his son alone that there was cause to fear . ” “ And what I have suffered , ” said the young girl , “ you shall never know , my lord . ” Monte Cristo smiled .
“ By my father ’ s tomb , ” said he , extending his hand over the head of the young girl , “ I swear to you , Haydée , that if any misfortune happens , it will not be to me . ” “ I believe you , my lord , as <unk> as if God had spoken to me , ” said the young girl , presenting her forehead to him .
Monte Cristo pressed on that pure beautiful forehead a kiss which made two hearts <unk> at once , the one violently , the other <unk> .
“ Oh , ” murmured the count , “ shall I then be permitted to love again ?
<unk> M. de Morcerf into the drawing-room , ” said he to Baptistin , while he led the beautiful Greek girl to a private staircase .
We must explain this visit , which although expected by Monte Cristo , is unexpected to our <unk> .
While Mercédès , as we have said , was making a similar <unk> of her property to Albert ’ s , while she was arranging her jewels , <unk> her <unk> , collecting her keys , to leave everything in perfect order , she did not perceive a pale and sinister face at a glass door which threw light into the passage , from which everything could be both seen and heard .
He who was thus looking , without being heard or seen , probably heard and saw all that passed in Madame de Morcerf ’ s apartments .
From that glass door the <unk> man went to the count ’ s bedroom and raised with a <unk> hand the curtain of a window <unk> the courtyard .
He remained there ten minutes , motionless and <unk> , listening to the beating of his own heart .
For him those ten minutes were very long .
It was then Albert , returning from his meeting with the count , perceived his father watching for his arrival behind a curtain , and turned aside .
The count ’ s eye <unk> ; he knew Albert had <unk> the count dreadfully , and that in every country in the world such an insult would lead to a deadly duel .
Albert returned safely — then the count was <unk> .
An indescribable ray of joy <unk> that wretched countenance like the last ray of the sun before it <unk> behind the clouds which bear the aspect , not of a <unk> <unk> , but of a tomb .
But as we have said , he waited in vain for his son to come to his apartment with the account of his triumph .
He easily understood why his son did not come to see him before he went to <unk> his father ’ s honor ; but when that was done , why did not his son come and throw himself into his arms ?
It was then , when the count could not see Albert , that he sent for his servant , who he knew was <unk> not to conceal anything from him .
Ten minutes afterwards , General Morcerf was seen on the steps in a black coat with a military collar , black <unk> , and black gloves .
He had apparently given previous orders , for as he reached the bottom step his carriage came from the <unk> ready for him .
The valet threw into the carriage his military cloak , in which two swords were wrapped , and , <unk> the door , he took his seat by the side of the coachman .
The coachman <unk> down for his orders .
“ To the Champs-Élysées , ” said the general ; “ the Count of Monte Cristo ’ s .
<unk> ! ” The horses bounded beneath the <unk> ; and in five minutes they stopped before the count ’ s door .
M. de Morcerf opened the door himself , and as the carriage rolled away he passed up the walk , rang , and entered the open door with his servant .
A moment afterwards , Baptistin announced the Count of Morcerf to Monte Cristo , and the latter , leading Haydée aside , ordered that Morcerf be asked into the drawing-room .
The general was <unk> the room the third time when , in turning , he perceived Monte Cristo at the door .
“ Ah , it is M. de Morcerf , ” said Monte Cristo quietly ; “ I thought I had not heard <unk> . ” “ Yes , it is I , ” said the count , whom a frightful <unk> of the lips prevented from <unk> freely .
“ May I know the cause which <unk> me the pleasure of seeing M. de Morcerf so early ? ” “ Had you not a meeting with my son this morning ? ” asked the general .
“ I had , ” replied the count .
“ And I know my son had good reasons to wish to fight with you , and to endeavor to kill you . ” “ Yes , sir , he had very good ones ; but you see that in spite of them he has not killed me , and did not even fight . ” “ Yet he considered you the cause of his father ’ s <unk> , the cause of the fearful ruin which has fallen on my house . ” “ It is true , sir , ” said Monte Cristo with his dreadful calmness ; “ a <unk> cause , but not the principal . ” “ <unk> you made , then , some <unk> or explanation ? ” “ I explained nothing , and it is he who <unk> to me . ” “ But to what do you <unk> this conduct ? ” “ To the conviction , probably , that there was one more guilty than I. ” “ And who was that ? ” “ His father . ” “ That may be , ” said the count , turning pale ; “ but you know the guilty do not like to find themselves <unk> . ” “ I know it , and I expected this result . ” “ You expected my son would be a coward ? ” cried the count .
“ M.
Albert de Morcerf is no coward ! ” said Monte Cristo .
“ A man who holds a sword in his hand , and sees a mortal enemy within reach of that sword , and does not fight , is a coward !
Why is he not here that I may tell him so ? ” “ Sir , ” replied Monte Cristo coldly , “ I did not expect that you had come here to relate to me your little family affairs .
Go and tell M. Albert that , and he may know what to answer you . ” “ Oh , no , no , ” said the general , smiling <unk> , “ I did not come for that purpose ; you are right .
I came to tell you that I also look upon you as my enemy .
I came to tell you that I hate you instinctively ; that it seems as if I had always known you , and always hated you ; and , in short , since the young people of the present day will not fight , it remains for us to do so .
Do you think so , sir ? ” “ Certainly .
And when I told you I had <unk> the result , it is the honor of your visit I <unk> to . ” “ So much the better .
Are you prepared ? ” “ Yes , sir . ” “ You know that we shall fight till one of us is dead , ” said the general , whose teeth were clenched with rage .
<unk> “ <unk> one of us <unk> , ” repeated Monte Cristo , moving his head slightly up and down .
“ Let us start , then ; we need no witnesses . ” “ Very true , ” said Monte Cristo ; “ it is unnecessary , we know each other so well ! ” “ On the contrary , ” said the count , “ we know so little of each other . ” “ Indeed ? ” said Monte Cristo , with the same <unk> coolness ; “ let us see .
Are you not the soldier Fernand who deserted on the <unk> of the battle of Waterloo ?
Are you not the <unk> Fernand who served as guide and spy to the French army in Spain ?
Are you not the Captain Fernand who betrayed , sold , and murdered his benefactor , Ali ?
And have not all these <unk> , united , made <unk> , the Count of Morcerf , <unk> of France ? ” “ Oh , ” cried the general , as if <unk> with a hot iron , “ wretch , — to reproach me with my shame when about , perhaps , to kill me !
No , I did not say I was a stranger to you .
I know well , <unk> , that you have penetrated into the darkness of the past , and that you have read , by the light of what torch I know not , every page of my life ; but perhaps I may be more honorable in my shame than you under your <unk> <unk> .
No — no , I am aware you know me ; but I know you only as an <unk> <unk> up in gold and <unk> .
You call yourself , in Paris , the Count of Monte Cristo ; in Italy , Sinbad the <unk> ; in <unk> , I forget what .
But it is your real name I want to know , in the midst of your hundred names , that I may pronounce it when we meet to fight , at the moment when I <unk> my sword through your heart . ” The Count of Monte Cristo turned dreadfully pale ; his eye seemed to burn with a <unk> fire .
He leaped towards a dressing-room near his bedroom , and in less than a moment , tearing off his cravat , his coat and waistcoat , he put on a sailor ’ s <unk> and hat , from beneath which rolled his long black hair .
He returned thus , formidable and <unk> , advancing with his arms crossed on his breast , towards the general , who could not understand why he had disappeared , but who on seeing him again , and feeling his teeth <unk> and his legs sink under him , drew back , and only stopped when he found a table to support his clenched hand .
“ Fernand , ” cried he , “ of my hundred names I need only tell you one , to <unk> you !
But you guess it now , do you not ? — or , rather , you remember it ?
For , notwithstanding all my sorrows and my <unk> , I show you today a face which the happiness of revenge makes young again — a face you must often have seen in your dreams since your marriage with Mercédès , my betrothed ! ” <unk> The general , with his head thrown back , hands extended , gaze fixed , looked silently at this dreadful apparition ; then seeking the wall to support him , he <unk> along close to it until he reached the door , through which he went out <unk> , uttering this single mournful , <unk> , <unk> cry : “ Edmond Dantès ! ” Then , with <unk> which were unlike any human sound , he dragged himself to the door , <unk> across the courtyard , and falling into the arms of his valet , he said in a voice scarcely <unk> , — “ <unk> , home . ” The fresh air and the shame he felt at having exposed himself before his servants , partly recalled his senses , but the ride was short , and as he drew near his house all his wretchedness <unk> .
He stopped at a short distance from the house and <unk> .
The door was wide open , a <unk> was standing in the middle of the yard — a strange sight before so noble a <unk> ; the count looked at it with terror , but without daring to inquire its meaning , he rushed towards his apartment .
Two persons were coming down the stairs ; he had only time to <unk> into an <unk> to avoid them .
It was Mercédès leaning on her son ’ s arm and leaving the house .
They passed close by the unhappy being , who , concealed behind the damask curtain , almost felt Mercédès dress <unk> past him , and his son ’ s warm breath , <unk> these words : “ <unk> , mother !
Come , this is no longer our home ! ” The words died away , the steps were lost in the distance .
The general drew himself up , <unk> to the curtain ; he uttered the most dreadful sob which ever escaped from the bosom of a father abandoned at the same time by his wife and son .
He soon heard the <unk> of the iron step of the <unk> , then the coachman ’ s voice , and then the rolling of the heavy vehicle shook the windows .
He darted to his bedroom to see once more all he had loved in the world ; but the <unk> drove on and the head of neither Mercédès nor her son appeared at the window to take a last look at the house or the deserted father and husband .
And at the very moment when the wheels of that coach crossed the <unk> a report was heard , and a thick smoke escaped through one of the <unk> of the window , which was broken by the <unk> .
<unk> Chapter 93 .
Valentine We may easily conceive where Morrel ’ s <unk> was .
On leaving Monte Cristo he walked slowly towards Villefort ’ s ; we say slowly , for Morrel had more than half an hour to spare to go five hundred steps , but he had hastened to take leave of Monte Cristo because he wished to be alone with his thoughts .
He knew his time well — the hour when Valentine was giving Noirtier his breakfast , and was sure not to be disturbed in the <unk> of this <unk> duty .
Noirtier and Valentine had given him leave to go twice a week , and he was now <unk> himself of that permission .
He arrived ; Valentine was expecting him .
<unk> and almost <unk> , she seized his hand and led him to her grandfather .
This uneasiness , <unk> almost to <unk> , arose from the report Morcerf ’ s adventure had made in the world , for the affair at the Opera was generally known .
No one at Villefort ’ s doubted that a duel would <unk> from it .
Valentine , with her woman ’ s instinct , guessed that Morrel would be Monte Cristo ’ s second , and from the young man ’ s <unk> courage and his great affection for the count , she feared that he would not content himself with the <unk> part <unk> to him .
We may easily understand how eagerly the particulars were asked for , given , and received ; and Morrel could read an indescribable joy in the eyes of his beloved , when she knew that the <unk> of this affair was as happy as it was unexpected .
“ Now , ” said Valentine , <unk> to Morrel to sit down near her grandfather , while she took her seat on his <unk> , — “ now let us talk about our own affairs .
You know , Maximilian , grandpapa once thought of leaving this house , and taking an apartment away from M. de Villefort ’ s . ” “ Yes , ” said Maximilian , “ I recollect the project , of which I highly approved . ” “ Well , ” said Valentine , “ you may approve again , for grandpapa is again thinking of it . ” “ <unk> , ” said Maximilian .
<unk> “ And do you know , ” said Valentine , “ what reason grandpapa gives for leaving this house . ” Noirtier looked at Valentine to <unk> silence , but she did not notice him ; her looks , her eyes , her smile , were all for Morrel .
“ Oh , whatever may be M. Noirtier ’ s reason , ” answered Morrel , “ I can readily believe it to be a good one . ” “ An excellent one , ” said Valentine .
“ He <unk> the air of the Faubourg <unk> is not good for me . ” “ Indeed ? ” said Morrel ; “ in that M. Noirtier may be right ; you have not seemed to be well for the last fortnight . ” “ Not very , ” said Valentine .
“ And grandpapa has become my physician , and I have the greatest confidence in him , because he knows everything . ” “ Do you then really suffer ? ” asked Morrel quickly .
“ Oh , it must not be called suffering ; I feel a general uneasiness , that is all .
I have lost my appetite , and my stomach feels as if it were <unk> to get accustomed to something . ” Noirtier did not lose a word of what Valentine said .
“ And what treatment do you <unk> for this singular complaint ? ” “ A very simple one , ” said Valentine .
“ I <unk> every morning a <unk> of the mixture prepared for my grandfather .
When I say one <unk> , I began by one — now I take four .
<unk> says it is a <unk> . ” Valentine smiled , but it was evident that she suffered .
Maximilian , in his <unk> , gazed silently at her .
She was very beautiful , but her usual pallor had increased ; her eyes were more brilliant than ever , and her hands , which were generally white like <unk> , now more resembled wax , to which time was <unk> a <unk> hue .
From Valentine the young man looked towards Noirtier .
The latter watched with strange and deep interest the young girl , absorbed by her affection , and he also , like Morrel , followed those traces of inward suffering which was so little <unk> to a common <unk> that they escaped the notice of everyone but the grandfather and the lover .
“ But , ” said Morrel , “ I thought this mixture , of which you now take four <unk> , was prepared for M. Noirtier ? ” “ I know it is very bitter , ” said Valentine ; “ so bitter , that all I drink afterwards appears to have the same taste . ” Noirtier looked <unk> at his <unk> .
“ Yes , grandpapa , ” said Valentine ; “ it is so .
Just now , before I came down to you , I drank a glass of <unk> water ; I left half , because it seemed so bitter . ” Noirtier turned pale , and made a sign that he wished to speak .
Valentine rose to fetch the <unk> .
Noirtier watched her with evident anguish .
In fact , the blood was rushing to the young girl ’ s head already , her cheeks were becoming red .
“ Oh , ” cried she , without losing any of her cheerfulness , “ this is singular !
I can ’ t see !
Did the sun <unk> in my eyes ? ” And she leaned against the window .
“ The sun is not shining , ” said Morrel , more alarmed by Noirtier ’ s expression than by Valentine ’ s <unk> .
He ran towards her .
The young girl smiled .
“ <unk> up , ” said she to Noirtier .
“ Do not be alarmed , Maximilian ; it is nothing , and has already passed away .
But listen !
Do I not hear a carriage in the courtyard ? ” She opened Noirtier ’ s door , ran to a window in the passage , and returned hastily .
“ Yes , ” said she , “ it is Madame Danglars and her daughter , who have come to call on us .
Good-bye ; — I must run away , for they would send here for me , or , rather , farewell till I see you again .
Stay with grandpapa , Maximilian ; I promise you not to persuade them to stay . ” <unk> Morrel watched her as she left the room ; he heard her ascend the little staircase which led both to Madame de Villefort ’ s apartments and to hers .
As soon as she was gone , Noirtier made a sign to Morrel to take the <unk> .
Morrel obeyed ; guided by Valentine , he had learned how to understand the old man quickly .
<unk> , however , as he was to the work , he had to repeat most of the letters of the <unk> and to find every word in the <unk> , so that it was ten minutes before the thought of the old man was <unk> by these words , “ <unk> the glass of water and the <unk> from Valentine ’ s room . ” Morrel rang immediately for the servant who had taken Barrois ’ s situation , and in Noirtier ’ s name gave that order .
The servant soon returned .
The <unk> and the glass were completely empty .
Noirtier made a sign that he wished to speak .
“ Why are the glass and <unk> empty ? ” asked he ; “ Valentine said she only drank half the <unk> . ” The <unk> of this new question occupied another five minutes .
“ I do not know , ” said the servant , “ but the <unk> is in Mademoiselle Valentine ’ s room : perhaps she has <unk> them . ” “ <unk> her , ” said Morrel , <unk> Noirtier ’ s thought this time by his look .
The servant went out , but returned almost immediately .
“ Mademoiselle Valentine passed through the room to go to Madame de Villefort ’ s , ” said he ; “ and in passing , as she was <unk> , she drank what remained in the glass ; as for the <unk> , Master Edward had <unk> that to make a <unk> for his <unk> . ” Noirtier raised his eyes to heaven , as a <unk> does who <unk> his all on one stroke .
From that moment the old man ’ s eyes were fixed on the door , and did not quit it .
It was indeed Madame Danglars and her daughter whom Valentine had seen ; they had been <unk> into Madame de Villefort ’ s room , who had said she would receive them there .
That is why Valentine passed through her room , which was on a level with Valentine ’ s , and only separated from it by Edward ’ s .
The two ladies entered the drawing-room with that sort of official <unk> which <unk> a formal communication .
Among <unk> people manner is <unk> .
Madame de Villefort received them with equal solemnity .
Valentine entered at this moment , and the <unk> were resumed .
“ My dear friend , ” said the baroness , while the two young people were shaking hands , “ I and Eugénie are come to be the first to announce to you the approaching marriage of my daughter with Prince Cavalcanti . ” Danglars kept up the title of prince .
The popular banker found that it answered better than count .
“ <unk> me to present you my sincere <unk> , ” replied Madame de Villefort .
“ Prince Cavalcanti appears to be a young man of rare qualities . ” <unk> “ Listen , ” said the baroness , smiling ; “ speaking to you as a friend I can say that the prince does not yet appear all he will be .
He has about him a little of that foreign manner by which French persons recognize , at first sight , the Italian or German <unk> .
Besides , he gives evidence of great kindness of disposition , much <unk> of wit , and as to <unk> , M. Danglars <unk> me that his fortune is <unk> — that is his word . ” “ And then , ” said Eugénie , while turning over the leaves of Madame de Villefort ’ s <unk> , “ add that you have taken a great fancy to the young man . ” “ And , ” said Madame de Villefort , “ I need not ask you if you share that fancy . ” “ I ? ” replied Eugénie with her usual <unk> .
“ Oh , not the least in the world , madame !
My wish was not to confine myself to domestic cares , or the <unk> of any man , but to be an artist , and consequently free in heart , in person , and in thought . ” Eugénie pronounced these words with so firm a tone that the color mounted to Valentine ’ s cheeks .
The timid girl could not understand that <unk> nature which appeared to have none of the <unk> of woman .
“ At any rate , ” said she , “ since I am to be married whether I will or not , I ought to be <unk> to Providence for having released me from my engagement with M. Albert de Morcerf , or I should this day have been the wife of a <unk> man . ” “ It is true , ” said the baroness , with that strange simplicity sometimes met with among fashionable ladies , and of which <unk> intercourse can never entirely <unk> them , — “ it is very true that had not the <unk> hesitated , my daughter would have married Monsieur Albert .
The general depended much on it ; he even came to force M. Danglars .
We have had a narrow escape . ” “ But , ” said Valentine , <unk> , “ does all the father ’ s shame <unk> upon the son ?
Monsieur Albert appears to me quite innocent of the <unk> charged against the general . ” “ Excuse me , ” said the <unk> young girl , “ Monsieur Albert claims and well <unk> his share .
It appears that after having <unk> M. de Monte Cristo at the Opera yesterday , he <unk> on the ground today . ” “ Impossible , ” said Madame de Villefort .
“ Ah , my dear friend , ” said Madame Danglars , with the same simplicity we before noticed , “ it is a fact .
I heard it from M. Debray , who was present at the explanation . ” Valentine also knew the truth , but she did not answer .
A single word had reminded her that Morrel was expecting her in M. Noirtier ’ s room .
<unk> engaged with a sort of inward contemplation , Valentine had ceased for a moment to join in the conversation .
She would , indeed , have found it impossible to repeat what had been said the last few minutes , when suddenly Madame Danglars ’ hand , pressed on her arm , aroused her from her <unk> .
“ What is it ? ” said she , starting at Madame Danglars ’ touch as she would have done from an <unk> shock .
“ It is , my dear Valentine , ” said the baroness , “ that you are , doubtless , suffering . ” <unk> “ I ? ” said the young girl , passing her hand across her burning forehead .
“ Yes , look at yourself in that glass ; you have turned pale and then red <unk> , three or four times in one minute . ” “ Indeed , ” cried Eugénie , “ you are very pale ! ” “ Oh , do not be alarmed ; I have been so for many days . ” <unk> as she was , the young girl knew that this was an opportunity to leave , and besides , Madame de Villefort came to her assistance .
“ <unk> , Valentine , ” said she ; “ you are really suffering , and these ladies will excuse you ; drink a glass of pure water , it will restore you . ” Valentine kissed Eugénie , bowed to Madame Danglars , who had already risen to take her leave , and went out .
“ That poor child , ” said Madame de Villefort when Valentine was gone , “ she makes me very uneasy , and I should not be astonished if she had some serious illness . ” Meanwhile , Valentine , in a sort of excitement which she could not quite understand , had crossed Edward ’ s room without <unk> some <unk> of the child , and through her own had reached the little staircase .
She was within three steps of the bottom ; she already heard Morrel ’ s voice , when suddenly a cloud passed over her eyes , her <unk> foot missed the step , her hands had no power to hold the <unk> , and falling against the wall she lost her balance wholly and <unk> to the floor .
Morrel bounded to the door , opened it , and found Valentine stretched out at the bottom of the stairs .
<unk> as a flash , he raised her in his arms and placed her in a chair .
Valentine opened her eyes .
“ Oh , what a <unk> thing I am , ” said she with feverish <unk> ; “ I don ’ t know my way .
I forgot there were three more steps before the landing . ” “ You have hurt yourself , perhaps , ” said Morrel .
“ What can I do for you , Valentine ? ” Valentine looked around her ; she saw the <unk> terror <unk> in Noirtier ’ s eyes .
“ Don ’ t <unk> , dear grandpapa , ” said she , endeavoring to smile ; “ it is nothing — it is nothing ; I was <unk> , that is all . ” “ Another attack of <unk> , ” said Morrel , <unk> his hands .
“ Oh , attend to it , Valentine , I entreat you . ” “ But no , ” said Valentine , — “ no , I tell you it is all past , and it was nothing .
Now , let me tell you some news ; Eugénie is to be married in a week , and in three days there is to be a grand feast , a <unk> festival .
We are all invited , my father , Madame de Villefort , and I — at least , I understood it so . ” “ When will it be our turn to think of these things ?
Oh , Valentine , you who have so much influence over your grandpapa , try to make him answer — Soon . ” “ And do you , ” said Valentine , “ depend on me to <unk> the <unk> and <unk> the memory of grandpapa ? ” “ Yes , ” cried Morrel , “ make haste .
So long as you are not mine , Valentine , I shall always think I may lose you . ” “ Oh , ” replied Valentine with a <unk> movement , “ oh , indeed , Maximilian , you are too timid for an officer , for a soldier who , they say , never knows fear .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> ! ” She burst into a forced and melancholy laugh , her arms <unk> and <unk> , her head fell back on her chair , and she remained motionless .
The cry of terror which was stopped on Noirtier ’ s lips , seemed to start from his eyes .
Morrel understood it ; he knew he must call assistance .
The young man rang the bell violently ; the <unk> who had been in Mademoiselle Valentine ’ s room , and the servant who had replaced Barrois , ran in at the same moment .
Valentine was so pale , so cold , so <unk> that without listening to what was said to them they were seized with the fear which <unk> that house , and they flew into the passage crying for help .
Madame Danglars and Eugénie were going out at that moment ; they heard the cause of the <unk> .
“ I told you so ! ” exclaimed Madame de Villefort .
“ Poor child ! ” <unk> Chapter <unk> .
Maximilian ’ s <unk> At the same moment M. de Villefort ’ s voice was heard calling from his study , “ What is the matter ? ” Morrel looked at Noirtier who had recovered his <unk> , and with a glance indicated the <unk> where once before under somewhat similar circumstances , he had taken refuge .
He had only time to get his hat and throw himself breathless into the <unk> when the procureur ’ s <unk> was heard in the passage .
Villefort sprang into the room , ran to Valentine , and took her in his arms .
“ A physician , a physician , — M.
d ’ Avrigny ! ” cried Villefort ; “ or rather I will go for him myself . ” He flew from the apartment , and Morrel at the same moment darted out at the other door .
He had been struck to the heart by a frightful recollection — the conversation he had heard between the doctor and Villefort the night of Madame de Saint-Méran ’ s death , recurred to him ; these symptoms , to a less alarming extent , were the same which had preceded the death of Barrois .
At the same time Monte Cristo ’ s voice seemed to <unk> in his ear with the words he had heard only two hours before , “ Whatever you want , Morrel , come to me ; I have great power . ” More rapidly than thought , he darted down the Rue <unk> , and thence to the <unk> des Champs-Élysées .
Meanwhile M. de Villefort arrived in a hired cabriolet at M. d ’ Avrigny ’ s door .
He rang so violently that the porter was alarmed .
Villefort ran upstairs without saying a word .
The porter knew him , and let him pass , only calling to him : “ In his study , Monsieur <unk> — in his study ! ” Villefort pushed , or rather forced , the door open .
“ Ah , ” said the doctor , “ is it you ? ” “ Yes , ” said Villefort , closing the door after him , “ it is I , who am come in my turn to ask you if we are quite alone .
<unk> , my house is <unk> ! ” “ What ? ” said the latter with apparent coolness , but with deep emotion , “ have you another invalid ? ” “ Yes , doctor , ” cried Villefort , <unk> his hair , “ yes ! ” D ’ Avrigny ’ s look <unk> , “ I told you it would be so . ” Then he slowly uttered these words , “ Who is now dying in your house ?
What new victim is going to <unk> you of weakness before God ? ” A mournful sob burst from Villefort ’ s heart ; he approached the doctor , and seizing his arm , — “ Valentine , ” said he , “ it is Valentine ’ s turn ! ” <unk> “ Your daughter ! ” cried d ’ Avrigny with grief and surprise .
“ You see you were deceived , ” murmured the magistrate ; “ come and see her , and on her bed of agony entreat her pardon for having suspected her . ” “ Each time you have applied to me , ” said the doctor , “ it has been too late ; still I will go .
But let us make haste , sir ; with the enemies you have to do with there is no time to be lost . ” “ Oh , this time , doctor , you shall not have to reproach me with weakness .
This time I will know the assassin , and will pursue him . ” “ Let us try first to save the victim before we think of <unk> her , ” said d ’ Avrigny .
“ Come . ” The same cabriolet which had brought Villefort took them back at full speed , and at this moment Morrel <unk> at Monte Cristo ’ s door .
The count was in his study and was reading with an angry look something which Bertuccio had brought in haste .
<unk> the name of Morrel , who had left him only two hours before , the count raised his head , arose , and sprang to meet him .
“ What is the matter , Maximilian ? ” asked he ; “ you are pale , and the perspiration <unk> from your forehead . ” Morrel fell into a chair .
“ Yes , ” said he , “ I came quickly ; I wanted to speak to you . ” “ Are all your family well ? ” asked the count , with an affectionate <unk> , whose sincerity no one could for a moment doubt .
“ Thank you , count — thank you , ” said the young man , evidently embarrassed how to begin the conversation ; “ yes , everyone in my family is well . ” “ So much the better ; yet you have something to tell me ? ” replied the count with increased anxiety .
“ Yes , ” said Morrel , “ it is true ; I have but now left a house where death has just entered , to run to you . ” “ Are you then come from M. de Morcerf ’ s ? ” asked Monte Cristo .
“ No , ” said Morrel ; “ is someone dead in his house ? ” “ The general has just <unk> his brains out , ” replied Monte Cristo with great coolness .
“ Oh , what a dreadful event ! ” cried Maximilian .
“ Not for the countess , or for Albert , ” said Monte Cristo ; “ a dead father or husband is better than a <unk> one , — blood <unk> out shame . ” “ Poor countess , ” said Maximilian , “ I pity her very much ; she is so noble a woman ! ” “ <unk> Albert also , Maximilian ; for believe me he is the worthy son of the countess .
But let us return to yourself .
You have hastened to me — can I have the happiness of being useful to you ? ” <unk> “ Yes , I need your help : that is I thought like a madman that you could lend me your assistance in a case where God alone can <unk> me . ” “ Tell me what it is , ” replied Monte Cristo .
“ Oh , ” said Morrel , “ I know not , indeed , if I may reveal this secret to mortal ears , but fatality <unk> me , necessity <unk> me , count — — ” Morrel hesitated .
“ Do you think I love you ? ” said Monte Cristo , taking the young man ’ s hand <unk> in his .
“ Oh , you <unk> me , and something tells me there , ” placing his hand on his heart , “ that I ought to have no secret from you . ” “ You are right , Morrel ; God is speaking to your heart , and your heart speaks to you .
Tell me what it says . ” “ Count , will you allow me to send Baptistin to inquire after someone you know ? ” “ I am at your service , and still more my servants . ” “ Oh , I cannot live if she is not better . ” “ Shall I ring for Baptistin ? ” “ No , I will go and speak to him myself . ” Morrel went out , called Baptistin , and whispered a few words to him .
The valet ran directly .
“ Well , have you sent ? ” asked Monte Cristo , seeing Morrel return .
“ Yes , and now I shall be more calm . ” “ You know I am waiting , ” said Monte Cristo , smiling .
“ Yes , and I will tell you .
One evening I was in a garden ; a <unk> of trees concealed me ; no one suspected I was there .
Two persons passed near me — allow me to conceal their names for the present ; they were speaking in an <unk> , and yet I was so interested in what they said that I did not lose a single word . ” “ This is a gloomy introduction , if I may judge from your pallor and shuddering , Morrel . ” “ Oh , yes , very gloomy , my friend .
<unk> had just died in the house to which that garden belonged .
One of the persons whose conversation I <unk> was the master of the house ; the other , the physician .
The former was <unk> to the latter his grief and fear , for it was the second time within a month that death had suddenly and <unk> entered that house which was apparently destined to destruction by some <unk> angel , as an object of God ’ s anger . ” “ Ah , indeed ? ” said Monte Cristo , looking earnestly at the young man , and by an imperceptible movement turning his chair , so that he remained in the shade while the light fell full on Maximilian ’ s face .
“ Yes , ” continued Morrel , “ death had entered that house twice within one month . ” “ And what did the doctor answer ? ” asked Monte Cristo .
“ He replied — he replied , that the death was not a natural one , and must be attributed ” — “ To what ? ” “ To poison . ” “ Indeed ! ” said Monte Cristo with a slight <unk> which in moments of extreme emotion helped him to disguise a blush , or his pallor , or the intense interest with which he listened ; “ indeed , Maximilian , did you hear that ? ” “ Yes , my dear count , I heard it ; and the doctor added that if another death occurred in a similar way he must appeal to justice . ” Monte Cristo listened , or appeared to do so , with the greatest calmness .
“ Well , ” said Maximilian , “ death came a third time , and neither the master of the house nor the doctor said a word .
Death is now , perhaps , striking a fourth blow .
Count , what am I bound to do , being in possession of this secret ? ” “ My dear friend , ” said Monte Cristo , “ you appear to be relating an adventure which we all know by heart .
I know the house where you heard it , or one very similar to it ; a house with a garden , a master , a physician , and where there have been three unexpected and sudden <unk> .
Well , I have not <unk> your confidence , and yet I know all that as well as you , and I have no <unk> scruples .
No , it does not concern me .
You say an <unk> angel appears to have devoted that house to God ’ s anger — well , who says your <unk> is not reality ?
Do not notice things which those whose interest it is to see them pass over .
If it is God ’ s justice , instead of his anger , which is walking through that house , Maximilian , turn away your face and let his justice accomplish its purpose . ” Morrel shuddered .
There was something mournful , solemn , and terrible in the count ’ s manner .
“ Besides , ” continued he , in so changed a tone that no one would have supposed it was the same person speaking — “ besides , who says that it will begin again ? ” “ It has returned , count , ” exclaimed Morrel ; “ that is why I hastened to you . ” “ Well , what do you wish me to do ?
Do you wish me , for instance , to give information to the procureur ? ” Monte Cristo uttered the last words with so much meaning that Morrel , starting up , cried out : “ You know of whom I speak , count , do you not ? ” “ <unk> well , my good friend ; and I will prove it to you by putting the <unk> to the _ <unk> _ , or rather by <unk> the persons .
You were walking one evening in M. de Villefort ’ s garden ; from what you relate , I suppose it to have been the evening of Madame de Saint-Méran ’ s death .
You heard M. de Villefort talking to M. d ’ Avrigny about the death of M. de Saint-Méran , and that no less surprising , of the countess .
M. d ’ Avrigny said he believed they both proceeded from poison ; and you , honest man , have ever since been asking your heart and <unk> your conscience to know if you ought to <unk> or conceal this secret .
We are no longer in the <unk> <unk> ; there is no longer a <unk> , or <unk> <unk> ; what do you want to ask these people ?
‘ <unk> , what <unk> thou to do with me ? ’ as <unk> said .
My dear fellow , let them sleep on , if they are asleep ; let them grow pale in their <unk> , if they are disposed to do so , and pray do you remain in peace , who have no remorse to disturb you . ” <unk> grief was <unk> on Morrel ’ s features ; he seized Monte Cristo ’ s hand .
“ But it is beginning again , I say ! ” “ Well , ” said the Count , astonished at his <unk> , which he could not understand , and looking still more earnestly at Maximilian , “ let it begin again , — it is like the house of the <unk> ; <unk> God has condemned them , and they must submit to their punishment .
They will all disappear , like the <unk> children <unk> with cards , and which fall , one by one , under the breath of their <unk> , even if there are two hundred of them .
Three months since it was M. de Saint-Méran ; Madame de Saint-Méran two months since ; the other day it was Barrois ; today , the old Noirtier , or young Valentine . ” “ You knew it ? ” cried Morrel , in such a <unk> of terror that Monte Cristo started , — he whom the falling heavens would have found <unk> ; “ you knew it , and said nothing ? ” “ And what is it to me ? ” replied Monte Cristo , <unk> his shoulders ; “ do I know those people ?
and must I lose the one to save the other ?
<unk> , no , for between the <unk> and the victim I have no choice . ” “ But I , ” cried Morrel , <unk> with sorrow , “ I love her ! ” “ You love ? — whom ? ” cried Monte Cristo , starting to his feet , and seizing the two hands which Morrel was raising towards heaven .
“ I love most <unk> — I love <unk> — I love as a man who would give his <unk> to spare her a tear — I love Valentine de Villefort , who is being murdered at this moment !
Do you understand me ?
I love her ; and I ask God and you how I can save her ? ” Monte Cristo uttered a cry which those only can conceive who have heard the <unk> of a wounded lion .
“ <unk> man , ” cried he , <unk> his hands in his turn ; “ you love Valentine , — that daughter of an <unk> race ! ” Never had Morrel witnessed such an expression — never had so terrible an eye <unk> before his face — never had the genius of terror he had so often seen , either on the <unk> or in the <unk> nights of <unk> , shaken around him more dreadful fire .
He drew back terrified .
As for Monte Cristo , after this <unk> he closed his eyes as if dazzled by <unk> light .
In a moment he restrained himself so <unk> that the <unk> <unk> of his breast <unk> , as <unk> and <unk> waves yield to the sun ’ s <unk> influence when the cloud has passed .
This silence , <unk> , and struggle lasted about twenty seconds , then the count raised his <unk> face .
“ See , ” said he , “ my dear friend , how God <unk> the most <unk> and <unk> men for their indifference , by presenting dreadful scenes to their view .
I , who was looking on , an eager and curious <unk> , — I , who was watching the working of this mournful tragedy , — I , who like a wicked angel was laughing at the evil men committed protected by <unk> ( a secret is easily kept by the rich and powerful ) , I am in my turn <unk> by the <unk> whose <unk> course I was watching , and <unk> to the heart ! ” Morrel <unk> .
“ Come , come , ” continued the count , “ <unk> are <unk> , be a man , be strong , be full of hope , for I am here and will watch over you . ” Morrel shook his head <unk> .
“ I tell you to hope .
Do you understand me ? ” cried Monte Cristo .
“ Remember that I never uttered a <unk> and am never deceived .
It is twelve o ’ clock , Maximilian ; thank heaven that you came at noon rather than in the evening , or tomorrow morning .
Listen , Morrel — it is noon ; if Valentine is not now dead , she will not die . ” “ How so ? ” cried Morrel , “ when I left her dying ? ” Monte Cristo pressed his hands to his forehead .
What was passing in that brain , so loaded with dreadful secrets ?
What does the angel of light or the angel of darkness say to that mind , at once <unk> and generous ?
God only knows .
Monte Cristo raised his head once more , and this time he was calm as a child <unk> from its sleep .
“ Maximilian , ” said he , “ return home .
I command you not to stir — attempt nothing , not to let your countenance betray a thought , and I will send you <unk> .
Go . ” “ Oh , count , you <unk> me with that coolness .
Have you , then , power against death ?
Are you <unk> ?
Are you an angel ? ” And the young man , who had never <unk> from danger , <unk> before Monte Cristo with indescribable terror .
But Monte Cristo looked at him with so melancholy and sweet a smile , that Maximilian felt the tears <unk> his eyes .
“ I can do much for you , my friend , ” replied the count .
“ Go ; I must be alone . ” Morrel , <unk> by the extraordinary <unk> Monte Cristo exercised over everything around him , did not endeavor to resist it .
He pressed the count ’ s hand and left .
He stopped one moment at the door for Baptistin , whom he saw in the Rue <unk> , and who was running .
Meanwhile , Villefort and d ’ Avrigny had made all possible haste , Valentine had not <unk> from her <unk> fit on their arrival , and the doctor examined the invalid with all the care the circumstances demanded , and with an interest which the knowledge of the secret <unk> <unk> .
Villefort , closely watching his countenance and his lips , awaited the result of the examination .
Noirtier , <unk> than even the young girl , more eager than Villefort for the decision , was watching also intently and <unk> .
At last d ’ Avrigny slowly uttered these words : “ She is still alive ! ” “ Still ? ” cried Villefort ; “ oh , doctor , what a dreadful word is that . ” “ Yes , ” said the physician , “ I repeat it ; she is still alive , and I am astonished at it . ” “ But is she safe ? ” asked the father .
“ Yes , since she lives . ” At that moment d ’ Avrigny ’ s glance met Noirtier ’ s eye .
It <unk> with such extraordinary joy , so rich and full of thought , that the physician was struck .
He placed the young girl again on the chair , — her lips were scarcely <unk> , they were so pale and white , as well as her whole face , — and remained motionless , looking at Noirtier , who appeared to <unk> and <unk> all he did .
“ Sir , ” said d ’ Avrigny to Villefort , “ call Mademoiselle Valentine ’ s maid , if you please . ” Villefort went himself to find her ; and d ’ Avrigny approached Noirtier .
“ Have you something to tell me ? ” asked he .
The old man <unk> his eyes <unk> , which we may remember was his only way of expressing his <unk> .
“ <unk> ? ” “ Yes . ” “ Well , I will remain with you . ” At this moment Villefort returned , followed by the lady ’ s maid ; and after her came Madame de Villefort .
“ What is the matter , then , with this dear child ?
she has just left me , and she <unk> of being <unk> , but I did not think seriously of it . ” The young woman with tears in her eyes and every mark of affection of a true mother , approached Valentine and took her hand .
D ’ Avrigny continued to look at Noirtier ; he saw the eyes of the old man <unk> and become round , his cheeks turn pale and tremble ; the perspiration stood in drops upon his forehead .
“ Ah , ” said he , <unk> following Noirtier ’ s eyes , which were fixed on Madame de Villefort , who repeated : “ This poor child would be better in bed .
Come , <unk> , we will put her to bed . ” M. d ’ Avrigny , who saw that would be a means of his remaining alone with Noirtier , expressed his opinion that it was the best thing that could be done ; but he <unk> that anything should be given to her except what he ordered .
They carried Valentine away ; she had <unk> , but could scarcely move or speak , so shaken was her frame by the attack .
She had , however , just power to give one parting look to her grandfather , who in losing her seemed to be <unk> his very soul .
D ’ Avrigny followed the invalid , wrote a <unk> , ordered Villefort to take a cabriolet , go in person to a <unk> ’ s to get the <unk> <unk> , bring it himself , and wait for him in his daughter ’ s room .
Then , having renewed his <unk> not to give Valentine anything , he went down again to Noirtier , shut the doors carefully , and after <unk> himself that no one was listening : “ Do you , ” said he , “ know anything of this young lady ’ s illness ? ” “ Yes , ” said the old man .
“ We have no time to lose ; I will question , and do you answer me . ” Noirtier made a sign that he was ready to answer .
“ Did you <unk> the accident which has happened to your <unk> ? ” “ Yes . ” D ’ Avrigny reflected a moment ; then approaching Noirtier : “ Pardon what I am going to say , ” added he , “ but no <unk> should be neglected in this terrible situation .
Did you see poor Barrois die ? ” Noirtier raised his eyes to heaven .
“ Do you know of what he died ! ” asked d ’ Avrigny , placing his hand on Noirtier ’ s shoulder .
“ Yes , ” replied the old man .
“ Do you think he died a natural death ? ” A sort of smile was <unk> on the motionless lips of Noirtier .
“ Then you have thought that Barrois was <unk> ? ” “ Yes . ” “ Do you think the poison he fell a victim to was intended for him ? ” “ No . ” “ Do you think the same hand which <unk> struck Barrois has now attacked Valentine ? ” “ Yes . ” “ Then will she die too ? ” asked d ’ Avrigny , fixing his penetrating gaze on Noirtier .
He watched the effect of this question on the old man .
“ No , ” replied he with an air of triumph which would have <unk> the most clever <unk> .
“ Then you hope ? ” said d ’ Avrigny , with surprise .
“ Yes . ” “ What do you hope ? ” The old man made him understand with his eyes that he could not answer .
“ Ah , yes , it is true , ” murmured d ’ Avrigny .
Then , turning to Noirtier , — “ Do you hope the assassin will be tried ? ” “ No . ” “ Then you hope the poison will take no effect on Valentine ? ” “ Yes . ” “ It is no news to you , ” added d ’ Avrigny , “ to tell you that an attempt has been made to poison her ? ” The old man made a sign that he entertained no doubt upon the subject .
“ Then how do you hope Valentine will escape ? ” Noirtier kept his eyes <unk> fixed on the same spot .
D ’ Avrigny followed the direction and saw that they were fixed on a bottle containing the mixture which he took every morning .
“ Ah , indeed ? ” said d ’ Avrigny , struck with a sudden thought , “ has it occurred to you ” — Noirtier did not let him finish .
“ Yes , ” said he .
“ To prepare her system to resist poison ? ” “ Yes . ” “ By <unk> her by degrees — — ” “ Yes , yes , yes , ” said Noirtier , delighted to be understood .
“ Of course .
I had told you that there was <unk> in the mixture I give you . ” “ Yes . ” “ And by <unk> her to that poison , you have endeavored to <unk> the effect of a similar poison ? ” Noirtier ’ s joy continued .
“ And you have succeeded , ” exclaimed d ’ Avrigny .
“ Without that precaution Valentine would have died before assistance could have been procured .
The <unk> has been excessive , but she has only been shaken by it ; and this time , at any rate , Valentine will not die . ” A <unk> joy <unk> the old man ’ s eyes , which were raised towards heaven with an expression of infinite gratitude .
At this moment Villefort returned .
“ Here , doctor , ” said he , “ is what you sent me for . ” “ Was this prepared in your presence ? ” “ Yes , ” replied the procureur .
“ Have you not let it go out of your hands ? ” “ No . ” D ’ Avrigny took the bottle , poured some drops of the mixture it contained in the hollow of his hand , and swallowed them .
“ Well , ” said he , “ let us go to Valentine ; I will give instructions to everyone , and you , M. de Villefort , will yourself see that no one <unk> from them . ” <unk> At the moment when d ’ Avrigny was returning to Valentine ’ s room , accompanied by Villefort , an Italian priest , of serious <unk> and calm and firm tone , hired for his use the house adjoining the hotel of M. de Villefort .
No one knew how the three former <unk> of that house left it .
About two hours afterwards its foundation was reported to be <unk> ; but the report did not prevent the new <unk> <unk> himself there with his modest furniture the same day at five o ’ clock .
The <unk> was drawn up for three , six , or nine years by the new <unk> , who , according to the rule of the <unk> , paid six months in advance .
This new <unk> , who , as we have said , was an Italian , was called <unk> Signor <unk> Busoni .
<unk> were immediately called in , and that same night the <unk> at the end of the <unk> saw with surprise that <unk> and <unk> were occupied in <unk> the lower part of the <unk> house .
Chapter <unk> .
Father and <unk> We saw in a preceding <unk> how Madame Danglars went <unk> to announce to Madame de Villefort the approaching marriage of Eugénie Danglars and M. Andrea Cavalcanti .
This formal <unk> , which <unk> or appeared to <unk> , the <unk> of all the persons concerned in this <unk> affair , had been preceded by a scene to which our <unk> must be admitted .
We beg them to take one step <unk> , and to <unk> themselves , the morning of that day of great <unk> , into the <unk> , gilded salon we have before shown them , and which was the pride of its owner , Baron Danglars .
In this room , at about ten o ’ clock in the morning , the banker himself had been walking to and fro for some minutes <unk> and in evident uneasiness , watching both doors , and listening to every sound .
When his patience was exhausted , he called his valet .
“ <unk> , ” said he , “ see why Mademoiselle Eugénie has asked me to meet her in the drawing-room , and why she makes me wait so long . ” Having given this vent to his <unk> , the baron became more calm ; Mademoiselle Danglars had that morning requested an interview with her father , and had fixed on the gilded drawing-room as the spot .
The <unk> of this step , and above all its <unk> , had not a little surprised the banker , who had immediately obeyed his daughter by <unk> first to the drawing-room .
<unk> soon returned from his <unk> .
“ Mademoiselle ’ s lady ’ s maid says , sir , that mademoiselle is <unk> her <unk> , and will be here shortly . ” Danglars nodded , to signify that he was satisfied .
To the world and to his servants Danglars assumed the character of the <unk> man and the <unk> father .
This was one of his parts in the popular <unk> he was performing , — a <unk> he had adopted and which suited him about as well as the <unk> worn on the <unk> stage by paternal <unk> , who seen from one side , were the image of <unk> , and from the other showed lips drawn down in <unk> <unk> .
Let us hasten to say that in private the <unk> side descended to the level of the other , so that generally the <unk> man disappeared to give place to the brutal husband and <unk> father .
“ Why the devil does that foolish girl , who <unk> to wish to speak to me , not come into my study ?
and why on earth does she want to speak to me at all ? ” He was turning this thought over in his brain for the <unk> time , when the door opened and Eugénie appeared , <unk> in a <unk> black satin dress , her hair dressed and gloves on , as if she were going to the Italian Opera .
“ Well , Eugénie , what is it you want with me ?
and why in this solemn drawing-room when the study is so comfortable ? ” “ I quite understand why you ask , sir , ” said Eugénie , making a sign that her father might be seated , “ and in fact your two questions <unk> fully the <unk> of our conversation .
I will answer them both , and contrary to the usual method , the last first , because it is the least difficult .
I have chosen the drawing-room , sir , as our place of meeting , in order to avoid the disagreeable <unk> and <unk> of a banker ’ s study .
Those gilded <unk> , <unk> locked like gates of <unk> , <unk> of <unk> , come from I know not where , and the <unk> of letters from England , <unk> , Spain , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , have generally a strange influence on a father ’ s mind , and make him forget that there is in the world an interest greater and more sacred than the good opinion of his <unk> .
I have , therefore , chosen this drawing-room , where you see , smiling and happy in their magnificent <unk> , your portrait , mine , my mother ’ s , and all sorts of <unk> <unk> and touching <unk> .
I rely much on <unk> <unk> ; perhaps , with regard to you , they are <unk> , but I should be no artist if I had not some fancies . ” “ Very well , ” replied M. Danglars , who had listened to all this <unk> with <unk> coolness , but without understanding a word , since like every man <unk> with thoughts of the past , he was occupied with seeking the thread of his own ideas in those of the <unk> .
“ There is , then , the second point cleared up , or nearly so , ” said Eugénie , without the least confusion , and with that <unk> <unk> which distinguished her gesture and her language ; “ and you appear satisfied with the explanation .
Now , let us return to the first .
You ask me why I have requested this interview ; I will tell you in two words , sir ; I will not marry count Andrea Cavalcanti . ” Danglars leaped from his chair and raised his eyes and arms towards heaven .
<unk> “ Yes , indeed , sir , ” continued Eugénie , still quite calm ; “ you are astonished , I see ; for since this little affair began , I have not manifested the slightest opposition , and yet I am always sure , when the opportunity arrives , to oppose a determined and absolute will to people who have not consulted me , and things which <unk> me .
However , this time , my tranquillity , or <unk> as philosophers say , proceeded from another source ; it proceeded from a wish , like a <unk> and devoted daughter ” ( a slight smile was <unk> on the purple lips of the young girl ) , “ to practice obedience . ” “ Well ? ” asked Danglars .
“ Well , sir , ” replied Eugénie , “ I have tried to the very last and now that the moment has come , I feel in spite of all my efforts that it is impossible . ” “ But , ” said Danglars , whose weak mind was at first quite overwhelmed with the weight of this <unk> <unk> , <unk> evident <unk> and force of will , “ what is your reason for this refusal , Eugénie ?
what reason do you <unk> ? ” “ My reason ? ” replied the young girl .
“ Well , it is not that the man is more ugly , more foolish , or more disagreeable than any other ; no , M. Andrea Cavalcanti may appear to those who look at men ’ s faces and figures as a very good <unk> of his kind .
It is not , either , that my heart is less touched by him than any other ; that would be a <unk> ’ s reason , which I consider quite beneath me .
I actually love no one , sir ; you know it , do you not ?
I do not then see why , without real necessity , I should <unk> my life with a <unk> companion .
Has not some <unk> said , ‘ Nothing too much ’ ?
and another , ‘ I carry all my effects with me ’ ?
I have been taught these two <unk> in Latin and in Greek ; one is , I believe , from <unk> , and the other from <unk> .
Well , my dear father , in the <unk> of life — for life is an eternal <unk> of our hopes — I cast into the sea my useless <unk> , that is all , and I remain with my own will , disposed to live perfectly alone , and consequently perfectly free . ” “ <unk> girl , unhappy girl ! ” murmured Danglars , turning pale , for he knew from long experience the <unk> of the obstacle he had so suddenly encountered .
“ <unk> girl , ” replied Eugénie , “ unhappy girl , do you say , sir ?
No , indeed ; the exclamation appears quite <unk> and affected .
<unk> , on the contrary , for what am I in want of ?
The world calls me beautiful .
It is something to be well received .
I like a favorable reception ; it <unk> the countenance , and those around me do not then appear so ugly .
I possess a share of wit , and a certain relative <unk> , which <unk> me to draw from life in general , for the support of mine , all I meet with that is good , like the <unk> who <unk> the <unk> to get at its contents .
I am rich , for you have one of the first <unk> in France .
I am your only daughter , and you are not so <unk> as the fathers of the <unk> <unk> and <unk> , who <unk> their daughters for not giving them <unk> .
Besides , the <unk> law has deprived you of the power to <unk> me , at least entirely , as it has also of the power to <unk> me to marry Monsieur This or Monsieur That .
And so — being , beautiful , <unk> , somewhat <unk> , as the <unk> <unk> say , and rich — and that is happiness , sir — why do you call me unhappy ? ” Danglars , seeing his daughter smiling , and proud even to <unk> , could not entirely <unk> his brutal feelings , but they betrayed themselves only by an exclamation .
Under the fixed and <unk> gaze <unk> at him from under those beautiful black eyebrows , he <unk> turned away , and <unk> himself immediately , <unk> by the power of a resolute mind .
“ <unk> , my daughter , ” replied he with a smile , “ you are all you boast of being , excepting one thing ; I will not too hastily tell you which , but would rather leave you to guess it . ” Eugénie looked at Danglars , much surprised that one flower of her crown of pride , with which she had so <unk> <unk> herself , should be <unk> .
“ My daughter , ” continued the banker , “ you have perfectly explained to me the sentiments which influence a girl like you , who is determined she will not marry ; now it remains for me to tell you the motives of a father like me , who has decided that his daughter shall marry . ” Eugénie bowed , not as a <unk> daughter , but as an <unk> prepared for a discussion .
“ My daughter , ” continued Danglars , “ when a father <unk> his daughter to choose a husband , he has always some reason for wishing her to marry .
Some are affected with the <unk> of which you spoke just now , that of living again in their <unk> .
This is not my weakness , I tell you at once ; family joys have no charm for me .
I may acknowledge this to a daughter whom I know to be <unk> enough to understand my indifference , and not to <unk> it to me as a crime . ” “ This is not to the purpose , ” said Eugénie ; “ let us speak <unk> , sir ; I admire <unk> . ” “ Oh , ” said Danglars , “ I can , when circumstances render it desirable , <unk> your system , although it may not be my general practice .
I will therefore proceed .
I have proposed to you to marry , not for your sake , for indeed I did not think of you in the least at the moment ( you admire <unk> , and will now be satisfied , I hope ) ; but because it suited me to marry you as soon as possible , on account of certain <unk> <unk> I am desirous of entering into . ” Eugénie became uneasy .
<unk> “ It is just as I tell you , I assure you , and you must not be angry with me , for you have sought this <unk> .
I do not willingly enter into <unk> <unk> with an artist like you , who fears to enter my study lest she should <unk> disagreeable or <unk> <unk> and sensations .
But in that same banker ’ s study , where you very willingly presented yourself yesterday to ask for the thousand francs I give you <unk> for <unk> , you must know , my dear young lady , that many things may be learned , useful even to a girl who will not marry .
There one may learn , for instance , what , out of regard to your nervous <unk> , I will inform you of in the drawing-room , <unk> , that the credit of a banker is his physical and moral life ; that credit <unk> him as breath <unk> the body ; and M. de Monte Cristo once gave me a <unk> on that subject , which I have never forgotten .
There we may learn that as credit <unk> , the body becomes a corpse , and this is what must happen very soon to the banker who is proud to own so good a <unk> as you for his daughter . ” But Eugénie , instead of <unk> , drew herself up under the blow .
“ <unk> ? ” said she .
“ Exactly , my daughter ; that is precisely what I mean , ” said Danglars , almost <unk> his nails into his breast , while he preserved on his harsh features the smile of the <unk> though clever man ; “ ruined — yes , that is it . ” “ Ah ! ” said Eugénie .
“ Yes , ruined !
Now it is revealed , this secret so full of horror , as the tragic poet says .
Now , my daughter , learn from my lips how you may <unk> this misfortune , so far as it will affect you . ” “ Oh , ” cried Eugénie , “ you are a bad <unk> , if you imagine I <unk> on my own account the catastrophe of which you warn me .
I ruined ?
and what will that signify to me ?
Have I not my talent left ?
Can I not , like <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> for myself what you would never have given me , whatever might have been your fortune , a hundred or a hundred and fifty thousand livres per <unk> , for which I shall be indebted to no one but myself ; and which , instead of being given as you gave me those poor twelve thousand francs , with <unk> looks and <unk> for my <unk> , will be accompanied with <unk> , with <unk> , and with flowers ?
And if I do not possess that talent , which your smiles prove to me you doubt , should I not still have that ardent love of independence , which will be a <unk> for wealth , and which in my mind <unk> even the instinct of <unk> ?
No , I <unk> not on my own account , I shall always find a resource ; my books , my <unk> , my <unk> , all the things which cost but little , and which I shall be able to procure , will remain my own .
“ Do you think that I sorrow for Madame Danglars ?
<unk> yourself again ; either I am greatly mistaken , or she has provided against the catastrophe which <unk> you , and , which will pass over without <unk> her .
She has taken care for herself , — at least I hope so , — for her attention has not been <unk> from her projects by watching over me .
She has <unk> my independence by <unk> <unk> my love for liberty .
Oh , no , sir ; from my childhood I have seen too much , and understood too much , of what has passed around me , for misfortune to have an <unk> power over me .
From my <unk> recollections , I have been beloved by no one — so much the worse ; that has naturally led me to love no one — so much the better — now you have my profession of faith . ” “ Then , ” said Danglars , pale with anger , which was not at all due to offended paternal love , — “ then , mademoiselle , you <unk> in your determination to <unk> my ruin ? ” “ Your ruin ?
I <unk> your ruin ?
What do you mean ?
I do not understand you . ” “ So much the better , I have a ray of hope left ; listen . ” “ I am all attention , ” said Eugénie , looking so earnestly at her father that it was an effort for the latter to endure her <unk> gaze .
“ M.
Cavalcanti , ” continued Danglars , “ is about to marry you , and will place in my hands his fortune , <unk> to three million livres . ” “ That is admirable ! ” said Eugénie with sovereign contempt , <unk> her gloves out one upon the other .
“ You think I shall <unk> you of those three millions , ” said Danglars ; “ but do not fear it .
They are destined to produce at least ten .
I and a brother banker have obtained a grant of a <unk> , the only <unk> <unk> which in these days promises to make good the <unk> prospects that <unk> once held out to the <unk> <unk> <unk> , in the fantastic <unk> scheme .
As I look at it , a <unk> part of a <unk> is worth fully as much as an <unk> of waste land on the banks of the <unk> .
We make in our case a <unk> , on a <unk> , which is an advance , as you see , since we gain at least ten , fifteen , twenty , or a hundred livres ’ worth of iron in exchange for our money .
Well , within a week I am to <unk> four millions for my share ; the four millions , I promise you , will produce ten or twelve . ” “ But during my visit to you the day before yesterday , sir , which you appear to recollect so well , ” replied Eugénie , “ I saw you arranging a <unk> — is not that the <unk> ? — of five millions and a half ; you even pointed it out to me in two <unk> on the <unk> , and you were astonished that so valuable a paper did not <unk> my eyes like lightning . ” “ Yes , but those five millions and a half are not mine , and are only a proof of the great confidence placed in me ; my title of popular banker has gained me the confidence of charitable <unk> , and the five millions and a half belong to them ; at any other time I should not have hesitated to make use of them , but the great <unk> I have recently sustained are well known , and , as I told you , my credit is rather shaken .
That <unk> may be at any moment <unk> , and if I had employed it for another purpose , I should bring on me a <unk> <unk> .
I do not <unk> <unk> , believe me , but they must be those which <unk> , not those which ruin .
Now , if you marry M. Cavalcanti , and I get the three millions , or even if it is thought I am going to get them , my credit will be restored , and my fortune , which for the last month or two has been swallowed up in <unk> which have been opened in my path by an <unk> fatality , will <unk> .
Do you understand me ? ” “ <unk> ; you <unk> me for three millions , do you not ? ” “ The greater the amount , the more <unk> it is to you ; it gives you an idea of your value . ” “ Thank you .
One word more , sir ; do you promise me to make what use you can of the report of the fortune M. Cavalcanti will bring without touching the money ?
This is no act of selfishness , but of delicacy .
I am willing to help <unk> your fortune , but I will not be an <unk> in the ruin of others . ” “ But since I tell you , ” cried Danglars , “ that with these three million — — ” “ Do you expect to recover your position , sir , without touching those three million ? ” “ I hope so , if the marriage should take place and <unk> my credit . ” “ Shall you be able to pay M. Cavalcanti the five hundred thousand francs you promise for my <unk> ? ” “ He shall receive them on returning from the mayor ’ <unk> . ” “ Very well ! ” “ What next ?
what more do you want ? ” “ I wish to know if , in <unk> my signature , you leave me entirely free in my person ? ” “ <unk> . ” “ Then , as I said before , sir , — very well ; I am ready to marry M. Cavalcanti . ” “ But what are you up to ? ” “ Ah , that is my affair .
What advantage should I have over you , if knowing your secret I were to tell you mine ? ” Danglars bit his lips .
“ Then , ” said he , “ you are ready to pay the official visits , which are absolutely <unk> ? ” “ Yes , ” replied Eugénie .
“ And to sign the contract in three days ? ” “ Yes . ” “ Then , in my turn , I also say , very well ! ” Danglars pressed his daughter ’ s hand in his .
But , extraordinary to relate , the father did not say , “ Thank you , my child , ” nor did the daughter smile at her father .
“ Is the <unk> ended ? ” asked Eugénie , rising .
Danglars motioned that he had nothing more to say .
Five minutes afterwards the <unk> <unk> to the touch of Mademoiselle d ’ <unk> ’ s fingers , and Mademoiselle Danglars was singing <unk> ’ s <unk> on <unk> .
At the end of the piece <unk> entered , and announced to Eugénie that the horses were to the carriage , and that the baroness was waiting for her to pay her visits .
We have seen them at Villefort ’ s ; they proceeded then on their course .
<unk> VOLUME <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> Chapter <unk> .
The <unk> Three days after the scene we have just described , <unk> towards five o ’ clock in the afternoon of the day fixed for the signature of the contract between Mademoiselle Eugénie Danglars and Andrea Cavalcanti , whom the banker <unk> in calling prince , a fresh breeze was <unk> the leaves in the little garden in front of the Count of Monte Cristo ’ s house , and the count was preparing to go out .
While his horses were impatiently <unk> the ground , held in by the coachman , who had been seated a quarter of an hour on his box , the elegant <unk> with which we are familiar rapidly turned the angle of the <unk> , and cast out on the <unk> M. Andrea Cavalcanti , as <unk> up and gay as if he were going to marry a <unk> .
He inquired after the count with his usual <unk> , and <unk> lightly to the first story met him at the top of the stairs .
The count stopped on seeing the young man .
As for Andrea , he was <unk> , and when he was once <unk> nothing stopped him .
“ Ah , good morning , my dear count , ” said he .
“ Ah , M. Andrea , ” said the latter , with his <unk> tone ; “ how do you do ? ” “ <unk> , as you see .
I am come to talk to you about a thousand things ; but , first tell me , were you going out or just returned ? ” “ I was going out , sir . ” “ Then , in order not to <unk> you , I will get up with you if you please in your carriage , and <unk> shall follow with my <unk> in <unk> . ” “ No , ” said the count , with an imperceptible smile of contempt , for he had no wish to be seen in the young man ’ s society , — “ no ; I prefer listening to you here , my dear M. Andrea ; we can <unk> better <unk> , and there is no coachman to <unk> our conversation . ” The count returned to a small drawing-room on the first floor , sat down , and crossing his legs motioned to the young man to take a seat also .
Andrea assumed his <unk> manner .
“ You know , my dear count , ” said he , “ the ceremony is to take place this evening .
At nine o ’ clock the contract is to be signed at my <unk> ’ s . ” “ Ah , indeed ? ” said Monte Cristo .
“ What ; is it news to you ?
Has not M. Danglars informed you of the ceremony ? ” “ Oh , yes , ” said the count ; “ I received a letter from him yesterday , but I do not think the hour was mentioned . ” “ <unk> my <unk> trusted to its general <unk> . ” “ Well , ” said Monte Cristo , “ you are fortunate , M. Cavalcanti ; it is a most suitable alliance you are <unk> , and Mademoiselle Danglars is a handsome girl . ” “ Yes , indeed she is , ” replied Cavalcanti , in a very modest tone .
“ <unk> all , she is very rich , — at least , I believe so , ” said Monte Cristo .
“ Very rich , do you think ? ” replied the young man .
“ <unk> ; it is said M. Danglars <unk> at least half of his fortune . ” “ And he <unk> fifteen or twenty millions , ” said Andrea with a look sparkling with joy .
“ Without <unk> , ” added Monte Cristo , “ that he is on the <unk> of entering into a sort of <unk> already in <unk> in the United States and in England , but quite <unk> in France . ” “ Yes , yes , I know what you mean , — the <unk> , of which he has obtained the grant , is it not ? ” “ <unk> ; it is generally believed he will gain ten millions by that affair . ” “ Ten millions !
Do you think so ?
It is magnificent ! ” said Cavalcanti , who was quite <unk> at the <unk> sound of these golden words .
“ Without <unk> , ” replied Monte Cristo , “ that all his fortune will come to you , and <unk> too , since Mademoiselle Danglars is an only daughter .
Besides , your own fortune , as your father assured me , is almost equal to that of your betrothed .
But enough of money matters .
Do you know , M. Andrea , I think you have managed this affair rather <unk> ? ” “ Not badly , by any means , ” said the young man ; “ I was born for a <unk> . ” “ Well , you must become a <unk> ; <unk> , you know , is something that is not to be acquired ; it is <unk> .
Have you lost your heart ? ” “ Indeed , I fear it , ” replied Andrea , in the tone in which he had heard <unk> or <unk> reply to <unk> at the <unk> <unk> .
“ Is your love returned ? ” “ I suppose so , ” said Andrea with a triumphant smile , “ since I am accepted .
But I must not forget one grand point . ” “ Which ? ” “ That I have been <unk> assisted . ” “ <unk> . ” “ I have , indeed . ” “ By circumstances ? ” “ No ; by you . ” “ By me ?
Not at all , prince , ” said Monte Cristo laying a marked <unk> on the title , “ what have I done for you ?
Are not your name , your social position , and your merit sufficient ? ” “ No , ” said Andrea , — “ no ; it is useless for you to say so , count .
I <unk> that the position of a man like you has done more than my name , my social position , and my merit . ” “ You are completely mistaken , sir , ” said Monte Cristo coldly , who felt the <unk> <unk> of the young man , and understood the bearing of his words ; “ you only acquired my protection after the influence and fortune of your father had been <unk> ; for , after all , who procured for me , who had never seen either you or your illustrious father , the pleasure of your acquaintance ? — two of my good friends , Lord Wilmore and the Abbé Busoni .
What encouraged me not to become your <unk> , but to <unk> you ? — your father ’ s name , so well known in Italy and so highly <unk> .
<unk> , I do not know you . ” This calm tone and perfect ease made Andrea feel that he was , for the moment , restrained by a more <unk> hand than his own , and that the <unk> could not be easily broken through .
“ Oh , then my father has really a very large fortune , count ? ” “ It appears so , sir , ” replied Monte Cristo .
“ Do you know if the marriage <unk> he promised me has come ? ” “ I have been <unk> of it . ” “ But the three millions ? ” “ The three millions are probably on the road . ” “ Then I shall really have them ? ” “ Oh , well , ” said the count , “ I do not think you have yet known the want of money . ” Andrea was so surprised that he <unk> the matter for a moment .
Then , <unk> from his reverie : “ Now , sir , I have one request to make to you , which you will understand , even if it should be disagreeable to you . ” “ <unk> , ” said Monte Cristo .
“ I have formed an acquaintance , thanks to my good fortune , with many <unk> persons , and have , at least for the moment , a crowd of friends .
But marrying , as I am about to do , before all Paris , I ought to be supported by an illustrious name , and in the absence of the paternal hand some powerful one ought to lead me to the altar ; now , my father is not coming to Paris , is he ? ” “ He is old , covered with wounds , and <unk> dreadfully , he says , in travelling . ” “ I understand ; well , I am come to ask a favor of you . ” “ Of me ? ” “ Yes , of you . ” “ And pray what may it be ? ” “ Well , to take his part . ” “ Ah , my dear sir !
What ? — after the varied relations I have had the happiness to <unk> towards you , can it be that you know me so little as to ask such a thing ?
<unk> me to lend you half a million and , although such a <unk> is somewhat rare , on my honor , you would <unk> me less !
<unk> , then , what I thought I had already told you , that in <unk> in this world ’ s affairs , more especially in their moral <unk> , the Count of Monte Cristo has never ceased to entertain the scruples and even the <unk> of the East .
I , who have a <unk> at <unk> , one at <unk> , and one at <unk> , <unk> at a wedding ? — never ! ” “ Then you refuse me ? ” “ <unk> ; and were you my son or my brother I would refuse you in the same way . ” “ But what must be done ? ” said Andrea , disappointed .
“ You said just now that you had a hundred friends . ” “ Very true , but you introduced me at M. Danglars ’ . ” “ Not at all !
Let us recall the exact facts .
You met him at a dinner party at my house , and you introduced yourself at his house ; that is a totally different affair . ” “ Yes , but , by my marriage , you have <unk> that . ” “ I ? — not in the least , I beg you to believe .
<unk> what I told you when you asked me to propose you .
‘ Oh , I never make <unk> , my dear prince , it is my settled principle . ’ ” Andrea bit his lips .
<unk> “ But , at least , you will be there ? ” “ Will all Paris be there ? ” “ Oh , certainly . ” “ Well , like all Paris , I shall be there too , ” said the count .
“ And will you sign the contract ? ” “ I see no objection to that ; my scruples do not go thus far . ” “ Well , since you will grant me no more , I must be content with what you give me .
But one word more , count . ” “ What is it ? ” “ <unk> . ” “ Be careful ; advice is worse than a service . ” “ Oh , you can give me this without <unk> yourself . ” “ Tell me what it is . ” “ Is my wife ’ s fortune five hundred thousand livres ? ” “ That is the sum M. Danglars himself announced . ” “ <unk> I receive it , or leave it in the hands of the notary ? ” “ This is the way such affairs are generally arranged when it is wished to do them <unk> : Your two <unk> <unk> a meeting , when the contract is signed , for the next or the following day ; then they exchange the two <unk> , for which they each give a receipt ; then , when the marriage is celebrated , they place the amount at your disposal as the chief member of the alliance . ” “ Because , ” said Andrea , with a certain <unk> uneasiness , “ I thought I heard my <unk> say that he intended <unk> our property in that famous <unk> affair of which you spoke just now . ” “ Well , ” replied Monte Cristo , “ it will be the way , everybody says , of <unk> your fortune in twelve months .
Baron Danglars is a good father , and knows how to <unk> . ” “ In that case , ” said Andrea , “ everything is all right , excepting your refusal , which quite <unk> me . ” “ You must <unk> it only to natural scruples under similar circumstances . ” “ Well , ” said Andrea , “ let it be as you wish .
This evening , then , at nine o ’ clock . ” “ Adieu till then . ” <unk> a slight resistance on the part of Monte Cristo , whose lips turned pale , but who preserved his <unk> smile , Andrea seized the count ’ s hand , pressed it , jumped into his <unk> , and disappeared .
The four or five remaining hours before nine o ’ clock arrived , Andrea employed in <unk> , paying visits , — <unk> to induce those of whom he had spoken to appear at the banker ’ s in their <unk> <unk> , — dazzling them by promises of <unk> in <unk> which have since turned every brain , and in which Danglars was just taking the <unk> .
In fact , at half-past eight in the evening the grand salon , the gallery adjoining , and the three other <unk> on the same floor , were filled with a <unk> crowd , who <unk> but little in the event , but who all <unk> in that love of being present wherever there is anything fresh to be seen .
An <unk> would say that the <unk> of the fashionable world are <unk> of flowers which attract <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> .
<unk> No one could deny that the rooms were <unk> illuminated ; the light <unk> forth on the <unk> <unk> and the silk <unk> ; and all the bad taste of <unk> , which had only their <unk> to boast of , shone in its splendor .
Mademoiselle Eugénie was dressed with elegant simplicity in a <unk> white silk dress , and a white rose half concealed in her <unk> black hair was her only <unk> , <unk> by a single <unk> .
Her eyes , however , betrayed that perfect confidence which <unk> the <unk> simplicity of this modest <unk> .
Madame Danglars was <unk> at a short distance with Debray , Beauchamp , and Château-Renaud .
Debray was admitted to the house for this grand ceremony , but on the same <unk> with everyone else , and without any particular privilege .
M. Danglars , surrounded by <unk> and men connected with the <unk> , was <unk> a new theory of <unk> which he intended to <unk> when the course of events had compelled the government to call him into the <unk> .
Andrea , on whose arm hung one of the most <unk> <unk> of the Opera , was <unk> to him rather <unk> , since he was obliged to be bold to appear at ease , his future projects , and the new <unk> he meant to introduce to Parisian <unk> with his hundred and <unk> thousand livres per <unk> .
The crowd moved to and fro in the rooms like an <unk> and flow of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and diamonds .
As usual , the <unk> women were the most <unk> , and the <unk> the most <unk> .
If there was a beautiful <unk> , or a sweet rose , you had to search for it , concealed in some corner behind a mother with a <unk> , or an aunt with a <unk> .
At each moment , in the midst of the crowd , the <unk> , and the laughter , the <unk> ’ s voice was heard <unk> some name well known in the <unk> <unk> , respected in the army , or illustrious in the <unk> world , and which was acknowledged by a slight movement in the different groups .
But for one whose privilege it was to <unk> that ocean of human waves , how many were received with a look of indifference or a <unk> of disdain !
At the moment when the hand of the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> asleep , pointed to nine on its golden face , and the <unk> , the faithful type of <unk> thought , struck nine times , the name of the Count of Monte Cristo <unk> in its turn , and as if by an <unk> shock all the assembly turned towards the door .
The count was dressed in black and with his <unk> simplicity ; his white waistcoat displayed his <unk> noble chest and his black stock was <unk> <unk> because of its contrast with the deadly <unk> of his face .
His only <unk> was a chain , so fine that the <unk> gold thread was scarcely <unk> on his white waistcoat .
A circle was immediately formed around the door .
The count perceived at one glance Madame Danglars at one end of the drawing-room , M. Danglars at the other , and Eugénie in front of him .
He first advanced towards the baroness , who was <unk> with Madame de Villefort , who had come alone , Valentine being still an invalid ; and without turning aside , so clear was the road left for him , he passed from the baroness to Eugénie , whom he <unk> in such rapid and measured terms , that the proud artist was quite struck .
<unk> her was Mademoiselle Louise d ’ <unk> , who thanked the count for the letters of introduction he had so kindly given her for Italy , which she intended immediately to make use of .
On leaving these ladies he found himself with Danglars , who had advanced to meet him .
Having accomplished these three social duties , Monte Cristo stopped , looking around him with that expression peculiar to a certain class , which seems to say , “ I have done my duty , now let others do <unk> . ” Andrea , who was in an adjoining room , had shared in the sensation caused by the arrival of Monte Cristo , and now came forward to pay his respects to the count .
He found him completely surrounded ; all were eager to speak to him , as is always the case with those whose words are few and <unk> .
The <unk> arrived at this moment and arranged their <unk> papers on the velvet cloth embroidered with gold which covered the table prepared for the signature ; it was a <unk> table supported on <unk> ’ <unk> .
One of the <unk> sat down , the other remained standing .
They were about to proceed to the reading of the contract , which half Paris assembled was to sign .
All took their places , or rather the ladies formed a circle , while the gentlemen ( more indifferent to the <unk> of what <unk> calls the _ style <unk> _ ) <unk> on the feverish agitation of Andrea , on M. Danglars ’ <unk> attention , Eugénie ’ s composure , and the light and <unk> manner in which the baroness treated this important affair .
The contract was read during a profound silence .
But as soon as it was finished , the <unk> was redoubled through all the <unk> ; the brilliant <unk> , the rolling millions which were to be at the command of the two young people , and which crowned the display of the wedding presents and the young lady ’ s diamonds , which had been made in a room entirely <unk> for that purpose , had exercised to the full their <unk> over the <unk> assembly .
Mademoiselle Danglars ’ <unk> were <unk> in the opinion of the young men , and for the moment seemed to <unk> the sun in splendor .
As for the ladies , it is <unk> to say that while they <unk> the millions , they thought they did not need them for themselves , as they were beautiful enough without them .
Andrea , surrounded by his friends , <unk> , flattered , beginning to believe in the reality of his dream , was almost bewildered .
The notary solemnly took the pen , <unk> it above his head , and said : “ Gentlemen , we are about to sign the contract . ” The baron was to sign first , then the <unk> of M. Cavalcanti , <unk> , then the baroness , afterwards the “ future couple , ” as they are <unk> in the abominable <unk> of legal documents .
The baron took the pen and signed , then the <unk> .
The baroness approached , leaning on Madame de Villefort ’ s arm .
“ My dear , ” said she , as she took the pen , “ is it not <unk> ?
An unexpected incident , in the affair of murder and theft at the Count of Monte Cristo ’ s , in which he nearly fell a victim , <unk> us of the pleasure of seeing M. de Villefort . ” “ Indeed ? ” said M. Danglars , in the same tone in which he would have said , “ Oh , well , what do I care ? ” “ As a matter of fact , ” said Monte Cristo , approaching , “ I am much afraid that I am the <unk> cause of his absence . ” “ What , you , count ? ” said Madame Danglars , <unk> ; “ if you are , take care , for I shall never forgive you . ” Andrea <unk> up his ears .
“ But it is not my fault , as I shall endeavor to prove . ” <unk> listened eagerly ; Monte Cristo who so rarely opened his lips , was about to speak .
“ You remember , ” said the count , during the most profound silence , “ that the unhappy wretch who came to <unk> me died at my house ; the <unk> is that he was <unk> by his <unk> , on <unk> to leave it . ” “ Yes , ” said Danglars .
“ In order that his wounds might be examined he was <unk> , and his clothes were thrown into a corner , where the police picked them up , with the exception of the waistcoat , which they <unk> . ” Andrea turned pale , and drew towards the door ; he saw a cloud rising in the horizon , which appeared to <unk> a coming storm .
“ Well , this waistcoat was discovered today , covered with blood , and with a hole over the heart . ” The ladies <unk> , and two or three prepared to faint .
“ It was brought to me .
No one could guess what the dirty <unk> could be ; I alone suspected that it was the waistcoat of the murdered man .
My valet , in examining this mournful <unk> , felt a paper in the pocket and drew it out ; it was a letter addressed to you , baron . ” “ To me ? ” cried Danglars .
“ Yes , indeed , to you ; I succeeded in <unk> your name under the blood with which the letter was <unk> , ” replied Monte Cristo , amid the general <unk> of amazement .
“ But , ” asked Madame Danglars , looking at her husband with uneasiness , “ how could that prevent M. de Villefort — — ” “ In this simple way , madame , ” replied Monte Cristo ; “ the waistcoat and the letter were both what is <unk> <unk> evidence ; I therefore sent them to the king ’ s attorney .
You understand , my dear baron , that legal <unk> are the <unk> in criminal cases ; it was , perhaps , some plot against you . ” Andrea looked <unk> at Monte Cristo and disappeared in the second drawing-room .
“ <unk> , ” said Danglars ; “ was not this murdered man an old <unk> ? ” <unk> “ Yes , ” replied the count ; “ a <unk> named Caderousse . ” Danglars turned slightly pale ; Andrea reached the <unk> beyond the little drawing-room .
“ But go on <unk> , ” said Monte Cristo ; “ I perceive that my story has caused a general emotion , and I beg to <unk> to you , baroness , and to Mademoiselle Danglars . ” The baroness , who had signed , returned the pen to the notary .
“ Prince Cavalcanti , ” said the latter ; “ Prince Cavalcanti , where are you ? ” “ Andrea , Andrea , ” repeated several young people , who were already on sufficiently intimate terms with him to call him by his Christian name .
“ <unk> the prince ; inform him that it is his turn to sign , ” cried Danglars to one of the <unk> .
But at the same instant the crowd of guests rushed in alarm into the principal salon as if some frightful monster had entered the apartments , _ <unk> <unk> <unk> _ .
There was , indeed , reason to retreat , to be alarmed , and to <unk> .
An officer was placing two soldiers at the door of each drawing-room , and was advancing towards Danglars , preceded by a <unk> of police , <unk> with his <unk> .
Madame Danglars uttered a <unk> and fainted .
Danglars , who thought himself threatened ( certain <unk> are never calm ) , — Danglars even before his guests showed a countenance of <unk> terror .
“ What is the matter , sir ? ” asked Monte Cristo , advancing to meet the <unk> .
“ Which of you gentlemen , ” asked the magistrate , without replying to the count , “ <unk> to the name of Andrea Cavalcanti ? ” A cry of astonishment was heard from all parts of the room .
They searched ; they questioned .
“ But who then is Andrea Cavalcanti ? ” asked Danglars in amazement .
“ A <unk> , escaped from <unk> at Toulon . ” “ And what crime has he committed ? ” “ He is accused , ” said the <unk> with his <unk> voice , “ of having assassinated the man named Caderousse , his former companion in prison , at the moment he was making his escape from the house of the Count of Monte Cristo . ” Monte Cristo cast a rapid glance around him .
Andrea was gone .
Chapter <unk> .
The <unk> for <unk> A few minutes after the scene of confusion produced in the <unk> of M. Danglars by the unexpected appearance of the <unk> of soldiers , and by the <unk> which had followed , the <unk> was deserted with as much rapidity as if a case of <unk> or of <unk> <unk> had broken out among the guests .
In a few minutes , through all the doors , down all the <unk> , by every <unk> , everyone hastened to retire , or rather to fly ; for it was a situation where the ordinary <unk> , — which even the best friends are so eager to offer in great <unk> , — were seen to be utterly <unk> .
There remained in the banker ’ s house only Danglars , <unk> in his study , and making his statement to the officer of gendarmes ; Madame Danglars , terrified , in the <unk> with which we are acquainted ; and Eugénie , who with haughty air and <unk> lip had retired to her room with her <unk> companion , Mademoiselle Louise d ’ <unk> .
As for the numerous servants ( more numerous that evening than usual , for their number was augmented by <unk> and <unk> from the Café de Paris ) , <unk> on their <unk> their anger at what they <unk> the insult to which they had been <unk> , they collected in groups in the hall , in the <unk> , or in their rooms , thinking very little of their duty , which was thus naturally interrupted .
Of all this household , only two persons deserve our notice ; these are Mademoiselle Eugénie Danglars and Mademoiselle Louise d ’ <unk> .
The betrothed had retired , as we said , with haughty air , <unk> lip , and the <unk> of an <unk> <unk> , followed by her companion , who was <unk> and more disturbed than herself .
On reaching her room Eugénie locked her door , while Louise fell on a chair .
“ Ah , what a dreadful thing , ” said the young <unk> ; “ who would have suspected it ?
M. Andrea Cavalcanti a murderer — a <unk> escaped — a convict ! ” An <unk> smile <unk> the lip of Eugénie .
“ In truth , I was <unk> , ” said she .
“ I escaped the Morcerf only to fall into the Cavalcanti . ” “ Oh , do not <unk> the two , Eugénie . ” “ Hold your tongue !
The men are all infamous , and I am happy to be able now to do more than <unk> them — I <unk> them . ” “ What shall we do ? ” asked Louise .
“ What shall we do ? ” “ Yes . ” “ Why , the same we had intended doing three days since — set off . ” “ What ? — although you are not now going to be married , you intend still — — ” “ Listen , Louise .
I hate this life of the fashionable world , always ordered , measured , <unk> , like our <unk> .
What I have always wished for , desired , and <unk> , is the life of an artist , free and independent , <unk> only on my own resources , and <unk> only to myself .
<unk> here ?
What for ? — that they may try , a month hence , to marry me again ; and to whom ? — M.
Debray , perhaps , as it was once proposed .
No , Louise , no !
This evening ’ s adventure will serve for my excuse .
I did not seek one , I did not ask for one .
God sends me this , and I <unk> it <unk> ! ” “ How strong and <unk> you are ! ” said the fair , <unk> girl to her <unk> companion .
“ Did you not yet know me ?
Come , Louise , let us talk of our affairs .
The <unk> — — ” “ Was happily bought three days since . ” “ Have you had it sent where we are to go for it ? ” “ Yes . ” “ Our passport ? ” “ Here it is . ” And Eugénie , with her usual <unk> , opened a printed paper , and read : “ M.
<unk> d ’ <unk> , twenty years of age ; profession , artist ; hair black , eyes black ; travelling with his sister . ” “ <unk> !
How did you get this passport ? ” “ When I went to ask M. de Monte Cristo for letters to the <unk> of the <unk> at Rome and Naples , I expressed my fears of travelling as a woman ; he perfectly understood them , and <unk> to procure for me a man ’ s passport , and two days after I received this , to which I have added with my own hand , ‘ travelling with his sister . ’ ” <unk> “ Well , ” said Eugénie cheerfully , “ we have then only to <unk> up our <unk> ; we shall start the evening of the <unk> of the contract , instead of the evening of the wedding — that is all . ” “ But consider the matter seriously , Eugénie ! ” “ Oh , I am done with considering !
I am tired of hearing only of <unk> reports , of the end of the month , of the rise and fall of Spanish <unk> , of <unk> bonds .
<unk> of that , Louise — do you understand ? — air , liberty , <unk> of birds , <unk> of <unk> , <unk> <unk> , Roman <unk> , the <unk> of Naples .
How much have we , Louise ? ” The young girl to whom this question was addressed drew from an <unk> <unk> a small <unk> with a lock , in which she counted <unk> bank-notes .
“ <unk> thousand francs , ” said she .
“ And as much , at least , in pearls , diamonds , and jewels , ” said Eugénie .
“ We are rich .
With <unk> thousand francs we can live like <unk> for two years , and <unk> for four ; but before six months — you with your music , and I with my voice — we shall double our capital .
Come , you shall take charge of the money , I of the <unk> ; so that if one of us had the misfortune to lose her treasure , the other would still have hers left .
Now , the <unk> — let us make haste — the <unk> ! ” “ Stop ! ” said Louise , going to listen at Madame Danglars ’ door .
“ What do you fear ? ” “ That we may be discovered . ” “ The door is locked . ” “ They may tell us to open it . ” “ They may if they like , but we will not . ” “ You are a perfect <unk> , Eugénie ! ” And the two young girls began to heap into a <unk> all the things they thought they should require .
“ There now , ” said Eugénie , “ while I change my costume do you lock the <unk> . ” Louise pressed with all the strength of her little hands on the top of the <unk> .
“ But I cannot , ” said she ; “ I am not strong enough ; do you shut it . ” “ Ah , you do well to ask , ” said Eugénie , laughing ; “ I forgot that I was <unk> , and you only the pale <unk> ! ” And the young girl , kneeling on the top , pressed the two parts of the <unk> together , and Mademoiselle d ’ <unk> passed the bolt of the <unk> through .
When this was done , Eugénie opened a drawer , of which she kept the key , and took from it a <unk> <unk> silk travelling cloak .
“ Here , ” said she , “ you see I have thought of everything ; with this cloak you will not be cold . ” “ But you ? ” “ Oh , I am never cold , you know !
Besides , with these men ’ s clothes — — ” “ Will you dress here ? ” “ Certainly . ” “ Shall you have time ? ” “ Do not be uneasy , you little coward !
All our servants are busy , <unk> the grand affair .
Besides , what is there astonishing , when you think of the grief I ought to be in , that I shut myself up ? — tell me ! ” “ No , truly — you comfort me . ” “ Come and help me . ” From the same drawer she took a man ’ s complete costume , from the boots to the coat , and a <unk> of linen , where there was nothing <unk> , but every requisite .
Then , with a <unk> which indicated that this was not the first time she had amused herself by <unk> the <unk> of the opposite sex , Eugénie drew on the boots and <unk> , tied her cravat , <unk> her waistcoat up to the throat , and put on a coat which admirably fitted her beautiful figure .
“ Oh , that is very good — indeed , it is very good ! ” said Louise , looking at her with admiration ; “ but that beautiful black hair , those magnificent <unk> , which made all the ladies sigh with envy , — will they go under a man ’ s hat like the one I see down there ? ” “ You shall see , ” said Eugénie .
And with her left hand seizing the thick mass , which her long fingers could scarcely grasp , she took in her right hand a pair of long <unk> , and soon the steel met through the rich and splendid hair , which fell in a <unk> at her feet as she leaned back to keep it from her coat .
Then she grasped the front hair , which she also cut off , without expressing the least regret ; on the contrary , her eyes <unk> with greater pleasure than usual under her <unk> eyebrows .
<unk> “ Oh , the magnificent hair ! ” said Louise , with regret .
“ And am I not a hundred times better thus ? ” cried Eugénie , <unk> the scattered <unk> of her hair , which had now quite a <unk> appearance ; “ and do you not think me <unk> so ? ” “ Oh , you are beautiful — always beautiful ! ” cried Louise .
“ Now , where are you going ? ” “ To <unk> , if you like ; it is the nearest <unk> .
We can go to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ; then up the <unk> to <unk> .
We will cross <unk> , and go down into Italy by the <unk> .
Will that do ? ” “ Yes . ” “ What are you looking at ? ” “ I am looking at you ; indeed you are <unk> like that !
One would say you were carrying me off . ” “ And they would be right , _ <unk> ! _ ” “ Oh , I think you <unk> , Eugénie . ” And the two young girls , whom everyone might have thought plunged in grief , the one on her own account , the other from interest in her friend , burst out laughing , as they cleared away every visible trace of the disorder which had naturally accompanied the <unk> for their escape .
Then , having <unk> out the lights , the two <unk> , looking and listening eagerly , with <unk> <unk> , opened the door of a dressing-room which led by a side staircase down to the yard , — Eugénie going first , and holding with one arm the <unk> , which by the opposite handle Mademoiselle d ’ <unk> scarcely raised with both hands .
The yard was empty ; the clock was striking twelve .
The porter was not yet gone to bed .
Eugénie approached softly , and saw the old man sleeping <unk> in an armchair in his lodge .
She returned to Louise , took up the <unk> , which she had placed for a moment on the ground , and they reached the <unk> under the shadow of the wall .
Eugénie concealed Louise in an angle of the <unk> , so that if the porter chanced to awake he might see but one person .
Then placing herself in the full light of the lamp which lit the yard : “ <unk> ! ” cried she , with her <unk> <unk> voice , and <unk> at the window .
The porter got up as Eugénie expected , and even advanced some steps to recognize the person who was going out , but seeing a young man striking his <unk> impatiently with his <unk> , he opened it immediately .
Louise <unk> through the <unk> gate like a <unk> , and bounded lightly forward .
Eugénie , apparently calm , although in all probability her heart beat somewhat <unk> than usual , went out in her turn .
A porter was passing and they gave him the <unk> ; then the two young girls , having told him to take it to No .
<unk> , Rue de la <unk> , walked behind this man , whose presence <unk> Louise .
As for Eugénie , she was as strong as a <unk> or a <unk> .
They arrived at the appointed spot .
Eugénie ordered the porter to put down the <unk> , gave him some pieces of money , and having <unk> at the <unk> sent him away .
The <unk> where Eugénie had <unk> was that of a little <unk> , who had been previously warned , and was not yet gone to bed .
She opened the door .
“ Mademoiselle , ” said Eugénie , “ let the porter get the <unk> from the <unk> , and fetch some <unk> from the hotel .
Here are five francs for his trouble . ” “ Indeed , ” said Louise , “ I admire you , and I could almost say respect you . ” The <unk> looked on in astonishment , but as she had been promised twenty louis , she made no remark .
In a quarter of an hour the porter returned with a <unk> and horses , which were <unk> , and put in the <unk> in a minute , while the porter fastened the <unk> on with the assistance of a <unk> and <unk> .
“ Here is the passport , ” said the <unk> , “ which way are we going , young gentleman ? ” “ To <unk> , ” replied Eugénie with an almost <unk> voice .
“ What do you say ? ” said Louise .
“ I am giving them the slip , ” said Eugénie ; “ this woman to whom we have given twenty louis may betray us for forty ; we will soon alter our direction . ” And the young girl jumped into the <unk> , which was admirably arranged for sleeping in , without scarcely touching the step .
“ You are always right , ” said the music <unk> , <unk> herself by the side of her friend .
A quarter of an hour afterwards the <unk> , having been put in the right road , passed with a <unk> of his <unk> through the <unk> of the Barrière <unk> .
“ Ah , ” said Louise , breathing freely , “ here we are out of Paris . ” “ Yes , my dear , the <unk> is an accomplished fact , ” replied Eugénie .
“ Yes , and without violence , ” said Louise .
“ I shall bring that forward as an <unk> circumstance , ” replied Eugénie .
These words were lost in the noise which the carriage made in rolling over the pavement of La <unk> .
M. Danglars no longer had a daughter .
Chapter <unk> .
The <unk> and <unk> <unk> And now let us leave Mademoiselle Danglars and her friend pursuing their way to <unk> , and return to poor Andrea Cavalcanti , so <unk> interrupted in his rise to fortune .
<unk> his youth , Master Andrea was a very skilful and intelligent boy .
We have seen that on the first <unk> which reached the salon he had gradually approached the door , and crossing two or three rooms at last disappeared .
But we have forgotten to mention one circumstance , which nevertheless ought not to be <unk> ; in one of the rooms he crossed , the _ <unk> _ of the <unk> was on <unk> .
There were <unk> of diamonds , <unk> <unk> , <unk> lace , English <unk> , and in fact all the <unk> things , the bare mention of which makes the hearts of young girls bound with joy , and which is called the _ <unk> _ <unk> Now , in passing through this room , Andrea proved himself not only to be clever and intelligent , but also <unk> , for he helped himself to the most valuable of the <unk> before him .
<unk> with this <unk> , Andrea leaped with a <unk> heart from the window , intending to slip through the hands of the gendarmes .
<unk> and well <unk> as an ancient <unk> , and <unk> as a <unk> , he walked for a quarter of an hour without knowing where to direct his steps , <unk> by the sole idea of getting away from the spot where if he <unk> he knew that he would surely be taken .
Having passed through the Rue du <unk> , guided by the instinct which leads thieves always to take the <unk> path , he found himself at the end of the Rue La <unk> .
There he stopped , breathless and <unk> .
He was quite alone ; on one side was the vast <unk> of the <unk> , on the other , Paris <unk> in darkness .
“ Am I to be captured ? ” he cried ; “ no , not if I can use more activity than my enemies .
My safety is now a mere question of speed . ” At this moment he saw a cab at the top of the Faubourg <unk> .
The dull driver , smoking his <unk> , was <unk> along toward the <unk> of the Faubourg Saint-Denis , where no doubt he <unk> had his station .
“ <unk> , friend ! ” said Benedetto .
“ What do you want , sir ? ” asked the driver .
“ Is your horse tired ? ” “ <unk> ?
oh , yes , tired enough — he has done nothing the whole of this blessed day !
Four wretched <unk> , and twenty sous over , making in all seven francs , are all that I have earned , and I ought to take ten to the owner . ” “ Will you add these twenty francs to the seven you have ? ” “ With pleasure , sir ; twenty francs are not to be <unk> .
Tell me what I am to do for this . ” “ A very easy thing , if your horse <unk> ’ t tired . ” “ I tell you he ’ ll go like the wind , — only tell me which way to drive . ” “ Towards the <unk> . ” “ Ah , I know the way — you get good <unk> <unk> over there . ” “ Exactly so ; I merely wish to <unk> one of my friends , with whom I am going to <unk> tomorrow at <unk> .
He should have waited for me here with a cabriolet till half-past eleven ; it is twelve , and , tired of waiting , he must have gone on . ” “ It is likely . ” “ Well , will you try and <unk> him ? ” “ Nothing I should like better . ” “ If you do not <unk> him before we reach <unk> you shall have twenty francs ; if not before <unk> , thirty . ” “ And if we do <unk> him ? ” “ <unk> , ” said Andrea , after a moment ’ s hesitation , at the end of which he remembered that he might safely promise .
“ That ’ s all right , ” said the man ; “ <unk> in , and we ’ re off !
<unk> ! ” Andrea got into the cab , which passed rapidly through the Faubourg Saint-Denis , along the Faubourg <unk> , crossed the barrier , and <unk> its way through the <unk> <unk> .
They never <unk> the <unk> friend , yet Andrea frequently inquired of people on foot whom he passed and at the <unk> which were not yet closed , for a green cabriolet and <unk> horse ; and as there are a great many <unk> to be seen on the road to the <unk> <unk> , and as <unk> of them are green , the inquiries increased at every step .
<unk> had just seen it pass ; it was only five hundred , two hundred , one hundred steps in advance ; at length they reached it , but it was not the friend .
Once the cab was also passed by a <unk> rapidly <unk> along by two <unk> .
“ Ah , ” said Cavalcanti to himself , “ if I only had that <unk> , those two good <unk> , and above all the passport that <unk> them on ! ” And he sighed deeply .
The <unk> contained Mademoiselle Danglars and Mademoiselle d ’ <unk> .
“ <unk> , hurry ! ” said Andrea , “ we must <unk> him soon . ” And the poor horse resumed the desperate <unk> it had kept up since leaving the barrier , and arrived <unk> at <unk> .
“ Certainly , ” said Andrea , “ I shall not <unk> my friend , but I shall kill your horse , therefore I had better stop .
Here are thirty francs ; I will sleep at the _ <unk> <unk> _ , and will secure a place in the first coach .
<unk> , friend . ” And Andrea , after placing six pieces of five francs each in the man ’ s hand , leaped lightly on to the <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> the sum , and turned back on his road to Paris .
Andrea pretended to go towards the hotel of the _ <unk> <unk> _ , but after leaning an instant against the door , and hearing the last sound of the cab , which was <unk> from view , he went on his road , and with a <unk> <unk> soon traversed the space of two leagues .
Then he rested ; he must be near <unk> , where he pretended to be going .
It was not fatigue that <unk> Andrea here ; it was that he might form some resolution , <unk> some plan .
It would be impossible to make use of a diligence , equally so to engage <unk> ; to travel either way a passport was necessary .
It was still more impossible to remain in the <unk> of the <unk> , one of the most open and <unk> guarded in France ; this was quite out of the question , especially to a man like Andrea , perfectly <unk> with criminal matters .
He sat down by the side of the <unk> , buried his face in his hands and reflected .
Ten minutes after he raised his head ; his resolution was made .
He threw some dust over the <unk> , which he had found time to <unk> from the antechamber and <unk> over his ball costume , and going to <unk> he knocked loudly at the door of the only inn in the place .
The host opened .
“ My friend , ” said Andrea , “ I was coming from <unk> to <unk> , when my horse , which is a troublesome creature , <unk> and threw me .
I must reach <unk> tonight , or I shall cause deep anxiety to my family .
Could you let me <unk> a horse of you ? ” An innkeeper has always a horse to let , whether it be good or bad .
The host called the <unk> , and ordered him to <unk> _ Le <unk> _ then he awoke his son , a child of seven years , whom he ordered to ride before the gentleman and bring back the horse .
Andrea gave the innkeeper twenty francs , and in taking them from his pocket dropped a visiting card .
This belonged to one of his friends at the Café de Paris , so that the innkeeper , <unk> it up after Andrea had left , was convinced that he had let his horse to the Count of <unk> , <unk> Rue <unk> , that being the name and address on the card .
_ Le <unk> _ was not a fast animal , but he kept up an easy , steady pace ; in three hours and a half Andrea had traversed the nine leagues which separated him from <unk> , and four o ’ clock struck as he reached the place where the <unk> stop .
There is an excellent tavern at <unk> , well remembered by those who have ever been there .
Andrea , who had often <unk> there in his <unk> about Paris , recollected the <unk> and <unk> inn ; he turned around , saw the sign by the light of a reflected lamp , and having <unk> the child , giving him all the small coin he had about him , he began <unk> at the door , very <unk> <unk> that having now three or four hours before him he had best <unk> himself against the <unk> of the morrow by a sound sleep and a good supper .
A waiter opened the door .
“ My friend , ” said Andrea , “ I have been <unk> at <unk> , and expected to catch the coach which passes by at midnight , but like a fool I have lost my way , and have been walking for the last four hours in the forest .
<unk> me into one of those pretty little rooms which <unk> the court , and bring me a cold fowl and a bottle of <unk> . ” The waiter had no suspicions ; Andrea spoke with perfect composure , he had a <unk> in his mouth , and his hands in the pocket of his top coat ; his clothes were <unk> made , his chin smooth , his boots <unk> ; he looked merely as if he had <unk> out very late , that was all .
While the waiter was preparing his room , the <unk> arose ; Andrea assumed his most charming smile , and asked if he could have No .
3 , which he had occupied on his last stay at <unk> .
<unk> , No .
3 was engaged by a young man who was travelling with his sister .
Andrea appeared in despair , but <unk> himself when the <unk> assured him that No .
7 , prepared for him , was situated precisely the same as No .
3 , and while <unk> his feet and <unk> about the last <unk> at <unk> , he waited until they announced his room to be ready .
Andrea had not spoken without cause of the pretty rooms looking out upon the court of the <unk> <unk> , which with its <unk> <unk> like those of a theatre , with the <unk> and <unk> <unk> round the light <unk> , forms one of the <unk> <unk> to an inn that you can imagine .
The fowl was tender , the wine old , the fire clear and sparkling , and Andrea was surprised to find himself eating with as good an appetite as though nothing had happened .
Then he went to bed and almost immediately fell into that deep sleep which is sure to visit men of twenty years of age , even when they are torn with remorse .
Now , here we are obliged to own that Andrea ought to have felt remorse , but that he did not .
This was the plan which had <unk> to him to afford the best chance of his security .
Before daybreak he would awake , leave the inn after <unk> paying his bill , and reaching the forest , he would , under <unk> of making studies in <unk> , <unk> the hospitality of some peasants , procure himself the dress of a <unk> and a <unk> , casting off the lion ’ s skin to assume that of the <unk> ; then , with his hands covered with <unk> , his hair <unk> by means of a <unk> <unk> , his complexion <unk> with a preparation for which one of his old comrades had given him the <unk> , he intended , by following the <unk> <unk> , to reach the nearest <unk> , walking by night and sleeping in the day in the <unk> and <unk> , and only entering inhabited <unk> to buy a <unk> from time to time .
Once past the <unk> , Andrea proposed making money of his diamonds ; and by <unk> the <unk> to ten bank-notes he always carried about with him in case of accident , he would then find himself <unk> of about <unk> livres , which he <unk> considered as no very <unk> condition after all .
Moreover , he <unk> much on the interest of the Danglars to <unk> up the <unk> of their own <unk> .
These were the reasons which , added to the fatigue , caused Andrea to sleep so <unk> .
In order that he might wake early he did not close the shutters , but contented himself with <unk> the door and placing on the table an <unk> and <unk> knife , whose temper he well knew , and which was never absent from him .
About seven in the morning Andrea was awakened by a ray of sunlight , which played , warm and brilliant , upon his face .
In all <unk> brains , the <unk> idea — and there always is one — is sure to be the last thought before sleeping , and the first upon waking in the morning .
Andrea had scarcely opened his eyes when his <unk> idea presented itself , and whispered in his ear that he had slept too long .
He jumped out of bed and ran to the window .
A gendarme was crossing the court .
A gendarme is one of the most striking objects in the world , even to a man void of uneasiness ; but for one who has a timid conscience , and with good cause too , the yellow , blue , and white uniform is really very alarming .
“ Why is that gendarme there ? ” asked Andrea of himself .
Then , all at once , he replied , with that <unk> which the reader has , doubtless , remarked in him , “ There is nothing astonishing in seeing a gendarme at an inn ; instead of being astonished , let me dress myself . ” And the youth dressed himself with a <unk> his valet de chambre had failed to <unk> him of during the two months of fashionable life he had led in Paris .
“ Now then , ” said Andrea , while <unk> himself , “ I ’ ll wait till he leaves , and then I ’ ll slip away . ” <unk> And , saying this , Andrea , who had now put on his boots and cravat , stole gently to the window , and a second time lifted up the <unk> curtain .
Not only was the first gendarme still there , but the young man now perceived a second yellow , blue , and white uniform at the foot of the staircase , the only one by which he could descend , while a third , on horseback , holding a <unk> in his fist , was posted as a sentinel at the great <unk> which alone afforded the means of <unk> .
The appearance of the third gendarme settled the matter , for a crowd of curious <unk> was extended before him , <unk> <unk> the entrance to the hotel .
“ They ’ re after me ! ” was Andrea ’ s first thought .
“ _ <unk> ! _ ” A pallor <unk> the young man ’ s forehead , and he looked around him with anxiety .
His room , like all those on the same floor , had but one <unk> to the gallery in the sight of everybody .
“ I am lost ! ” was his second thought ; and , indeed , for a man in Andrea ’ s situation , an arrest meant the <unk> , trial , and death , — death without mercy or delay .
For a moment he convulsively pressed his head within his hands , and during that brief period he became nearly mad with terror ; but soon a ray of hope <unk> in the multitude of thoughts which bewildered his mind , and a faint smile played upon his white lips and <unk> cheeks .
He looked around and saw the objects of his search upon the chimney-piece ; they were a pen , ink , and paper .
With forced composure he <unk> the pen in the ink , and wrote the following lines upon a sheet of paper : “ I have no money to pay my bill , but I am not a <unk> man ; I leave behind me as a <unk> this <unk> , worth ten times the amount .
I shall be <unk> for leaving at daybreak , for I was ashamed . ” He then drew the <unk> from his cravat and placed it on the paper .
This done , instead of leaving the door fastened , he drew back the bolts and even placed the door <unk> , as though he had left the room , forgetting to close it , and <unk> into the chimney like a man accustomed to that kind of <unk> exercise , after <unk> the <unk> , which represented <unk> with <unk> , and <unk> the very marks of his feet upon the ashes , he <unk> <unk> the hollow <unk> , which afforded him the only means of escape left .
At this precise time , the first gendarme Andrea had noticed walked upstairs , preceded by the <unk> of police , and supported by the second gendarme who guarded the staircase and was himself <unk> by the one stationed at the door .
Andrea was indebted for this visit to the following circumstances .
At daybreak , the <unk> were set at work in all directions , and almost immediately the authorities in every <unk> had <unk> their utmost <unk> to arrest the murderer of Caderousse .
<unk> , that royal residence and <unk> town , is well furnished with authorities , gendarmes , and <unk> of police ; they therefore began <unk> as soon as the <unk> <unk> arrived , and the <unk> and <unk> being the <unk> hotel in the town , they had naturally directed their first inquiries there .
Now , besides the reports of the <unk> <unk> the Hôtel de <unk> , which is next door to the <unk> and <unk> , it had been stated by others that a number of travellers had arrived during the night .
The sentinel who was relieved at six o ’ clock in the morning , remembered perfectly that , just as he was taking his post a few minutes past four , a young man arrived on horseback , with a little boy before him .
The young man , having <unk> the boy and horse , knocked at the door of the hotel , which was opened , and again closed after his entrance .
This late arrival had attracted much suspicion , and the young man being no other than Andrea , the <unk> and gendarme , who was a <unk> , directed their steps towards his room .
They found the door <unk> .
“ Oh , oh , ” said the <unk> , who thoroughly understood the <unk> ; “ a bad sign to find the door open !
I would rather find it <unk> <unk> . ” And , indeed , the little note and <unk> upon the table confirmed , or rather <unk> , the sad truth .
Andrea had fled .
We say <unk> , because the <unk> was too experienced to be convinced by a single proof .
He glanced around , looked in the bed , shook the curtains , opened the <unk> , and finally stopped at the chimney .
Andrea had taken the precaution to leave no traces of his feet in the ashes , but still it was an <unk> , and in this light was not to be passed over without serious <unk> .
The <unk> sent for some <unk> and straw , and having filled the chimney with them , set a light to it .
The fire <unk> , and the smoke ascended like the dull <unk> from a <unk> ; but still no prisoner fell down , as they expected .
The fact was , that Andrea , at war with society ever since his youth , was quite as deep as a gendarme , even though he were advanced to the rank of <unk> , and quite prepared for the fire , he had <unk> out on the roof and was <unk> down against the <unk> .
<unk> At one time he thought he was saved , for he heard the <unk> <unk> in a loud voice , to the two gendarmes , “ He is not here ! ” But <unk> to <unk> , he perceived that the latter , instead of <unk> , as might have been <unk> expected upon this <unk> , were watching with increased attention .
It was now his turn to look about him ; the Hôtel de <unk> , a <unk> <unk> century building , was on his right ; anyone could descend from the <unk> in the tower , and examine every corner of the roof below , and Andrea expected <unk> to see the head of a gendarme appear at one of these <unk> .
If once discovered , he knew he would be lost , for the roof afforded no chance of escape ; he therefore resolved to descend , not through the same chimney by which he had come up , but by a similar one <unk> to another room .
He looked around for a chimney from which no smoke <unk> , and having reached it , he disappeared through the <unk> without being seen by anyone .
At the same minute , one of the little windows of the Hôtel de <unk> was thrown open , and the head of a gendarme appeared .
For an instant it remained motionless as one of the stone <unk> of the building , then after a long sigh of disappointment the head disappeared .
The <unk> , calm and <unk> as the law he represented , passed through the crowd , without answering the thousand questions addressed to him , and re-entered the hotel .
“ Well ? ” asked the two gendarmes .
“ Well , my boys , ” said the <unk> , “ the <unk> must really have escaped early this morning ; but we will send to the <unk> and <unk> roads , and search the forest , when we shall catch him , no doubt . ” The honorable <unk> had scarcely expressed himself thus , in that <unk> which is peculiar to <unk> of the <unk> , when a loud <unk> , accompanied by the violent <unk> of a bell , <unk> through the court of the hotel .
“ Ah , what is that ? ” cried the <unk> .
“ Some traveller seems impatient , ” said the host .
“ What number was it that rang ? ” “ <unk> 3 . ” “ <unk> , waiter ! ” At this moment the <unk> and <unk> were redoubled .
“ <unk> ! ” said the <unk> , stopping the servant , “ the person who is <unk> appears to want something more than a waiter ; we will attend upon him with a gendarme .
Who <unk> <unk> 3 ? ” “ The little fellow who arrived last night in a <unk> with his sister , and who asked for an apartment with two beds . ” The bell here rang for the third time , with another <unk> of anguish .
“ <unk> me , Mr. <unk> ! ” said the <unk> ; “ tread in my steps . ” “ Wait an instant , ” said the host ; “ <unk> 3 has two <unk> , — inside and outside . ” “ Good , ” said the <unk> .
“ I will take charge of the inside one .
Are the <unk> loaded ? ” “ Yes , <unk> . ” “ Well , you guard the <unk> , and if he attempts to fly , fire upon him ; he must be a great criminal , from what the telegraph says . ” The <unk> , followed by the <unk> , disappeared by the inside staircase , accompanied by the noise which his <unk> respecting Andrea had excited in the crowd .
This is what had happened : Andrea had very <unk> managed to descend <unk> of the chimney , but then his foot slipped , and notwithstanding his <unk> , he came into the room with more speed and noise than he intended .
It would have signified little had the room been empty , but unfortunately it was occupied .
Two ladies , sleeping in one bed , were awakened by the noise , and fixing their eyes upon the spot whence the sound proceeded , they saw a man .
One of these ladies , the fair one , uttered those terrible <unk> which <unk> through the house , while the other , rushing to the <unk> , rang with all her strength .
Andrea , as we can see , was surrounded by misfortune .
“ For pity ’ s sake , ” he cried , pale and bewildered , without seeing whom he was addressing , — “ for pity ’ s sake do not call assistance !
<unk> me ! — I will not harm you . ” “ Andrea , the murderer ! ” cried one of the ladies .
“ Eugénie !
Mademoiselle Danglars ! ” exclaimed Andrea , stupefied .
“ <unk> , help ! ” cried Mademoiselle d ’ <unk> , taking the bell from her companion ’ s hand , and <unk> it yet more violently .
“ <unk> me , I am pursued ! ” said Andrea , <unk> his hands .
“ For pity , for mercy ’ s sake do not deliver me up ! ” “ It is too late , they are coming , ” said Eugénie .
“ Well , conceal me somewhere ; you can say you were <unk> alarmed ; you can turn their suspicions and save my life ! ” <unk> The two ladies , pressing closely to one another , and drawing the <unk> <unk> around them , remained silent to this <unk> voice , <unk> and fear taking possession of their minds .
“ Well , be it so , ” at length said Eugénie ; “ return by the same road you came , and we will say nothing about you , unhappy wretch . ” “ Here he is , here he is ! ” cried a voice from the landing ; “ here he is !
I see him ! ” The <unk> had put his eye to the <unk> , and had discovered Andrea in a <unk> of <unk> .
A violent blow from the <unk> end of the <unk> burst open the lock , two more forced out the bolts , and the broken door fell in .
Andrea ran to the other door , leading to the gallery , ready to rush out ; but he was stopped short , and he stood with his body a little thrown back , pale , and with the useless knife in his clenched hand .
“ <unk> , then ! ” cried Mademoiselle d ’ <unk> , whose pity returned as her fears <unk> ; “ fly ! ” “ Or kill yourself ! ” said Eugénie ( in a tone which a <unk> in the <unk> would have used , when <unk> the <unk> <unk> to finish his <unk> <unk> ) .
Andrea shuddered , and looked on the young girl with an expression which proved how little he understood such ferocious honor .
“ <unk> myself ? ” he cried , throwing down his knife ; “ why should I do so ? ” “ Why , you said , ” answered Mademoiselle Danglars , “ that you would be condemned to die like the worst <unk> . ” <unk> “ Bah , ” said Cavalcanti , crossing his arms , “ one has friends . ” The <unk> advanced to him , sword in hand .
“ Come , come , ” said Andrea , “ <unk> your sword , my fine fellow ; there is no occasion to make such a <unk> , since I give myself up ; ” and he held out his hands to be <unk> .
The two girls looked with horror upon this <unk> <unk> , the man of the world shaking off his <unk> and appearing as a <unk> .
Andrea turned towards them , and with an <unk> smile asked , “ Have you any message for your father , Mademoiselle Danglars , for in all probability I shall return to Paris ? ” Eugénie covered her face with her hands .
“ Oh , oh ! ” said Andrea , “ you need not be ashamed , even though you did post after me .
Was I not nearly your husband ? ” <unk> And with this <unk> Andrea went out , leaving the two girls a prey to their own feelings of shame , and to the <unk> of the crowd .
An hour after they stepped into their <unk> , both dressed in <unk> <unk> .
The gate of the hotel had been closed to screen them from sight , but they were forced , when the door was open , to pass through a throng of curious glances and whispering voices .
Eugénie closed her eyes ; but though she could not see , she could hear , and the <unk> of the crowd reached her in the carriage .
“ Oh , why is not the world a <unk> ? ” she exclaimed , throwing herself into the arms of Mademoiselle d ’ <unk> , her eyes sparkling with the same kind of rage which made <unk> wish that the Roman world had but one neck , that he might <unk> it at a single blow .
The next day they stopped at the Hôtel de <unk> , at <unk> .
The same evening Andrea was <unk> in the <unk> .
Chapter <unk> .
The <unk> We have seen how quietly Mademoiselle Danglars and Mademoiselle d ’ <unk> accomplished their <unk> and flight ; the fact being that everyone was too much occupied in his or her own affairs to think of <unk> .
We will leave the banker <unk> the enormous <unk> of his debt before the phantom of <unk> , and follow the baroness , who after being <unk> crushed under the weight of the blow which had struck her , had gone to seek her usual <unk> , Lucien Debray .
The baroness had looked forward to this marriage as a means of <unk> her of a <unk> which , over a girl of Eugénie ’ s character , could not fail to be rather a troublesome <unk> ; for in the <unk> relations which <unk> the <unk> of family union , the mother , to <unk> her <unk> over her daughter , must never fail to be a <unk> of wisdom and a type of perfection .
Now , Madame Danglars feared Eugénie ’ s <unk> and the influence of Mademoiselle d ’ <unk> ; she had frequently observed the <unk> expression with which her daughter looked upon Debray , — an expression which seemed to <unk> that she understood all her mother ’ s <unk> and <unk> <unk> with the intimate secretary ; moreover , she saw that Eugénie <unk> Debray , not only because he was a source of <unk> and <unk> under the paternal roof , but because she had at once <unk> him in that <unk> of <unk> whom <unk> <unk> to <unk> from the <unk> of men , and whom <unk> designated as animals upon two legs without <unk> .
<unk> , in this world of ours , each person views things through a certain medium , and so is prevented from seeing in the same light as others , and Madame Danglars , therefore , very much regretted that the marriage of Eugénie had not taken place , not only because the match was good , and likely to <unk> the happiness of her child , but because it would also set her at liberty .
She ran therefore to Debray , who , after having , like the rest of Paris , witnessed the contract scene and the <unk> attending it , had retired in haste to his club , where he was <unk> with some friends upon the events which served as a subject of conversation for <unk> of that city known as the capital of the world .
At the precise time when Madame Danglars , dressed in black and concealed in a long veil , was <unk> the stairs leading to Debray ’ s apartments , notwithstanding the <unk> of the concierge that the young man was not at home , Debray was occupied in <unk> the <unk> of a friend , who tried to persuade him that after the terrible scene which had just taken place he ought , as a friend of the family , to marry Mademoiselle Danglars and her two millions .
Debray did not defend himself very warmly , for the idea had sometimes crossed his mind ; still , when he recollected the independent , proud spirit of Eugénie , he positively <unk> it as utterly impossible , though the same thought again continually recurred and found a <unk> in his heart .
<unk> , play , and the conversation , which had become interesting during the discussion of such serious affairs , lasted till one o ’ clock in the morning .
Meanwhile Madame Danglars , veiled and uneasy , awaited the return of Debray in the little green room , seated between two <unk> of flowers , which she had that morning sent , and which , it must be confessed , Debray had himself arranged and <unk> with so much care that his absence was half <unk> in the eyes of the poor woman .
At twenty minutes to twelve , Madame Danglars , tired of waiting , returned home .
<unk> of a certain <unk> are like <unk> <unk> in one respect , they seldom return home after twelve o ’ clock .
The baroness returned to the hotel with as much caution as Eugénie used in leaving it ; she ran lightly upstairs , and with an <unk> heart entered her apartment , <unk> , as we know , to that of Eugénie .
She was fearful of <unk> any remark , and believed firmly in her daughter ’ s innocence and <unk> to the paternal roof .
She listened at Eugénie ’ s door , and hearing no sound tried to enter , but the bolts were in place .
Madame Danglars then concluded that the young girl had been overcome with the terrible excitement of the evening , and had gone to bed and to sleep .
She called the maid and questioned her .
“ Mademoiselle Eugénie , ” said the maid , “ retired to her apartment with Mademoiselle d ’ <unk> ; they then took tea together , after which they desired me to leave , saying that they needed me no longer . ” Since then the maid had been below , and like everyone else she thought the young ladies were in their own room ; Madame Danglars , therefore , went to bed without a shadow of suspicion , and began to <unk> over the recent events .
In proportion as her memory became <unk> , the <unk> of the evening were revealed in their true light ; what she had taken for confusion was a tumult ; what she had regarded as something <unk> , was in reality a disgrace .
And then the baroness remembered that she had felt no pity for poor Mercédès , who had been <unk> with as severe a blow through her husband and son .
“ Eugénie , ” she said to herself , “ is lost , and so are we .
The affair , as it will be reported , will cover us with shame ; for in a society such as ours <unk> <unk> a painful and <unk> wound .
How fortunate that Eugénie is possessed of that strange character which has so often made me tremble ! ” And her glance was turned towards heaven , where a mysterious Providence <unk> all things , and out of a fault , nay , even a vice , sometimes produces a blessing .
And then her thoughts , <unk> through space like a bird in the air , rested on Cavalcanti .
This Andrea was a wretch , a <unk> , an assassin , and yet his manners showed the effects of a sort of education , if not a complete one ; he had been presented to the world with the appearance of an immense fortune , supported by an honorable name .
How could she <unk> herself from this <unk> ?
To whom would she apply to help her out of this painful situation ?
Debray , to whom she had run , with the first instinct of a woman towards the man she loves , and who yet <unk> her , — Debray could but give her advice , she must apply to someone more powerful than he .
The baroness then thought of M. de Villefort .
It was M. de Villefort who had <unk> brought misfortune into her family , as though they had been strangers .
But , no ; on reflection , the procureur was not a <unk> man ; and it was not the magistrate , slave to his duties , but the friend , the <unk> friend , who <unk> but firmly cut into the very <unk> of the corruption ; it was not the executioner , but the <unk> , who wished to <unk> the honor of Danglars from <unk> <unk> with the <unk> young man they had presented to the world as their <unk> .
And since Villefort , the friend of Danglars , had acted in this way , no one could suppose that he had been previously acquainted with , or had lent himself to , any of Andrea ’ s <unk> .
Villefort ’ s conduct , therefore , upon reflection , appeared to the baroness as if <unk> for their mutual advantage .
But the <unk> of the procureur should stop there ; she would see him the next day , and if she could not make him fail in his duties as a magistrate , she would , at least , obtain all the indulgence he could allow .
She would <unk> the past , recall old recollections ; she would <unk> him by the remembrance of guilty , yet happy days .
M. de Villefort would <unk> the affair ; he had only to turn his eyes on one side , and allow Andrea to fly , and follow up the crime under that shadow of guilt called contempt of court .
And after this reasoning she slept easily .
At nine o ’ clock next morning she arose , and without <unk> for her maid or giving the least sign of her activity , she dressed herself in the same simple style as on the previous night ; then running downstairs , she left the hotel , walked to the Rue de <unk> , called a cab , and drove to M. de Villefort ’ s house .
For the last month this wretched house had presented the gloomy appearance of a <unk> <unk> with the <unk> .
Some of the apartments were closed within and without ; the shutters were only opened to admit a minute ’ s air , showing the <unk> face of a <unk> , and immediately afterwards the window would be closed , like a <unk> falling on a sepulchre , and the neighbors would say to each other in a low voice , “ Will there be another funeral today at the procureur ’ s house ? ” Madame Danglars <unk> shuddered at the <unk> aspect of the <unk> ; descending from the cab , she approached the door with trembling knees , and rang the bell .
Three times did the bell ring with a dull , heavy sound , seeming to <unk> , in the general sadness , before the concierge appeared and <unk> through the door , which he opened just wide enough to allow his words to be heard .
He saw a lady , a fashionable , <unk> dressed lady , and yet the door remained almost closed .
“ Do you intend opening the door ? ” said the baroness .
“ First , madame , who are you ? ” “ Who am I ?
You know me well enough . ” “ We no longer know anyone , madame . ” “ You must be mad , my friend , ” said the baroness .
“ Where do you come from ? ” “ Oh , this is too much ! ” “ Madame , these are my orders ; excuse me .
Your name ? ” “ The baroness Danglars ; you have seen me twenty times . ” “ <unk> , madame .
And now , what do you want ? ” “ Oh , how extraordinary !
I shall complain to M. de Villefort of the <unk> of his servants . ” “ Madame , this is precaution , not <unk> ; no one enters here without an order from M. d ’ Avrigny , or without speaking to the procureur . ” “ Well , I have business with the procureur . ” “ Is it pressing business ? ” “ You can imagine so , since I have not even brought my carriage out yet .
But enough of this — here is my card , take it to your master . ” “ Madame will await my return ? ” “ Yes ; go . ” The concierge closed the door , leaving Madame Danglars in the street .
She had not long to wait ; directly afterwards the door was opened wide enough to admit her , and when she had passed through , it was again shut .
Without losing sight of her for an instant , the concierge took a <unk> from his pocket as soon as they entered the court , and blew it .
The valet de chambre appeared on the <unk> .
“ You will excuse this poor fellow , madame , ” he said , as he preceded the baroness , “ but his orders are precise , and M. de Villefort begged me to tell you that he could not act otherwise . ” In the court showing his <unk> , was a <unk> who had been admitted with the same precautions .
The baroness ascended the steps ; she felt herself strongly <unk> with the sadness which seemed to <unk> her own , and still guided by the valet de chambre , who never lost sight of her for an instant , she was introduced to the magistrate ’ s study .
<unk> as Madame Danglars had been with the object of her visit , the treatment she had received from these <unk> appeared to her so <unk> , that she began by <unk> of it .
But Villefort , raising his head , bowed down by grief , looked up at her with so sad a smile that her <unk> died upon her lips .
“ <unk> my servants , ” he said , “ for a terror I cannot blame them for ; from being suspected they have become suspicious . ” Madame Danglars had often heard of the terror to which the magistrate <unk> , but without the evidence of her own <unk> she could never have believed that the sentiment had been carried so far .
“ You too , then , are unhappy ? ” she said .
“ Yes , madame , ” replied the magistrate .
“ Then you pity me ! ” “ <unk> , madame . ” “ And you understand what brings me here ? ” “ You wish to speak to me about the circumstance which has just happened ? ” “ Yes , sir , — a fearful misfortune . ” “ You mean a <unk> . ” “ A <unk> ? ” repeated the baroness .
“ Alas , madame , ” said the procureur with his <unk> calmness of manner , “ I consider those alone misfortunes which are <unk> . ” “ And do you suppose this will be forgotten ? ” “ Everything will be forgotten , madame , ” said Villefort .
“ Your daughter will be married tomorrow , if not today — in a week , if not tomorrow ; and I do not think you can regret the intended husband of your daughter . ” Madame Danglars gazed on Villefort , stupefied to find him so almost <unk> calm .
“ Am I come to a friend ? ” she asked in a tone full of mournful dignity .
“ You know that you are , madame , ” said Villefort , whose pale cheeks became slightly <unk> as he gave her the assurance .
And truly this assurance carried him back to different events from those now <unk> the baroness and him .
“ Well , then , be more affectionate , my dear Villefort , ” said the baroness .
“ Speak to me not as a magistrate , but as a friend ; and when I am in bitter anguish of spirit , do not tell me that I ought to be gay . ” Villefort bowed .
“ When I hear misfortunes named , madame , ” he said , “ I have within the last few months contracted the bad habit of thinking of my own , and then I cannot help drawing up an <unk> <unk> in my mind .
That is the reason that by the side of my misfortunes yours appear to me mere <unk> ; that is why my dreadful position makes yours appear <unk> .
But this <unk> you ; let us change the subject .
You were saying , madame — — ” “ I came to ask you , my friend , ” said the baroness , “ what will be done with this <unk> ? ” “ <unk> , ” repeated Villefort ; “ certainly , madame , you appear to <unk> some cases , and <unk> others .
<unk> , indeed ! — M.
Andrea Cavalcanti , or rather M. Benedetto , is nothing more nor less than an assassin ! ” “ Sir , I do not deny the justice of your <unk> , but the more <unk> you arm yourself against that unfortunate man , the more deeply will you strike our family .
Come , forget him for a moment , and instead of pursuing him , let him go . ” “ You are too late , madame ; the orders are <unk> . ” “ Well , should he be arrested — do they think they will arrest him ? ” “ I hope so . ” “ If they should arrest him ( I know that sometimes prisons afford means of escape ) , will you leave him in prison ? ” The procureur shook his head .
“ At least keep him there till my daughter be married . ” “ Impossible , madame ; justice has its <unk> . ” “ What , even for me ? ” said the baroness , half <unk> , half in earnest .
“ For all , even for myself among the rest , ” replied Villefort .
<unk> “ Ah ! ” exclaimed the baroness , without expressing the ideas which the exclamation betrayed .
Villefort looked at her with that piercing glance which <unk> the secrets of the heart .
“ Yes , I know what you mean , ” he said ; “ you <unk> to the terrible <unk> spread abroad in the world , that the <unk> which have kept me in mourning for the last three months , and from which Valentine has only escaped by a miracle , have not happened by natural means . ” “ I was not thinking of that , ” replied Madame Danglars quickly .
“ Yes , you were thinking of it , and with justice .
You could not help thinking of it , and saying to yourself , ‘ you , who pursue crime so <unk> , answer now , why are there <unk> crimes in your dwelling ? ’ ” The baroness became pale .
“ You were saying this , were you not ? ” “ Well , I own it . ” “ I will answer you . ” Villefort drew his armchair nearer to Madame Danglars ; then resting both hands upon his desk he said in a voice more hollow than usual : “ There are crimes which remain <unk> because the <unk> are unknown , and we might strike the innocent instead of the guilty ; but when the <unk> are discovered ” ( Villefort here extended his hand toward a large crucifix placed opposite to his desk ) — “ when they are discovered , I swear to you , by all I hold most sacred , that <unk> they may be they shall die .
Now , after the oath I have just taken , and which I will keep , madame , dare you ask for mercy for that wretch ! ” “ But , sir , are you sure he is as guilty as they say ? ” “ Listen ; this is his description : ‘ Benedetto , condemned , at the age of sixteen , for five years to the galleys for <unk> . ’ He promised well , as you see — first a <unk> , then an assassin . ” “ And who is this wretch ? ” “ Who can tell ? — a <unk> , a Corsican . ” “ Has no one owned him ? ” “ No one ; his parents are unknown . ” “ But who was the man who brought him from <unk> ? ” “ Another rascal like himself , perhaps his <unk> . ” The baroness clasped her hands .
“ Villefort , ” she exclaimed in her <unk> and most <unk> manner .
“ For Heaven ’ s sake , madame , ” said Villefort , with a <unk> of expression not altogether free from <unk> — “ for Heaven ’ s sake , do not ask pardon of me for a guilty wretch !
What am I ? — the law .
Has the law any eyes to witness your grief ?
Has the law ears to be <unk> by your sweet voice ?
Has the law a memory for all those soft recollections you endeavor to recall ?
No , madame ; the law has commanded , and when it <unk> it strikes .
You will tell me that I am a living being , and not a <unk> — a man , and not a volume .
Look at me , madame — look around me .
Has mankind treated me as a brother ?
Have men loved me ?
Have they spared me ?
Has anyone shown the mercy towards me that you now ask at my hands ?
No , madame , they struck me , always struck me !
<unk> “ <unk> , <unk> that you are , do you <unk> in fixing on me that <unk> eye , which <unk> me that I ought to blush ?
Well , be it so ; let me blush for the faults you know , and perhaps — perhaps for even more than those !
But having <unk> myself , — it may be more deeply than others , — I never rest till I have torn the <unk> from my <unk> , and found out their <unk> .
I have always found them ; and more , — I repeat it with joy , with triumph , — I have always found some proof of human <unk> or error .
Every criminal I <unk> seems to me living evidence that I am not a hideous exception to the rest .
Alas , alas , alas ; all the world is wicked ; let us therefore strike at <unk> ! ” Villefort pronounced these last words with a feverish rage , which gave a ferocious <unk> to his words .
“ But ” ’ said Madame Danglars , <unk> to make a last effort , “ this young man , though a murderer , is an <unk> , abandoned by everybody . ” “ So much the worse , or rather , so much the better ; it has been so <unk> that he may have none to weep his fate . ” “ But this is <unk> on the weak , sir . ” “ The weakness of a murderer ! ” “ His <unk> <unk> upon us . ” “ Is not death in my house ? ” “ Oh , sir , ” exclaimed the baroness , “ you are without pity for others , well , then , I tell you they will have no mercy on you ! ” “ Be it so ! ” said Villefort , raising his arms to heaven with a threatening gesture .
“ At least , delay the trial till the next <unk> ; we shall then have six months before us . ” “ No , madame , ” said Villefort ; “ instructions have been given .
There are yet five days left ; five days are more than I require .
Do you not think that I also long for forgetfulness ?
While working night and day , I sometimes lose all recollection of the past , and then I experience the same sort of happiness I can imagine the dead feel ; still , it is better than suffering . ” “ But , sir , he has fled ; let him escape — <unk> is a <unk> offence . ” “ I tell you it is too late ; early this morning the telegraph was employed , and at this very minute — — ” “ Sir , ” said the valet de chambre , entering the room , “ a <unk> has brought this <unk> from the <unk> of the <unk> . ” Villefort seized the letter , and hastily broke the <unk> .
Madame Danglars trembled with fear ; Villefort started with joy .
“ <unk> ! ” he exclaimed ; “ he was taken at <unk> , and all is over . ” Madame Danglars rose from her seat , pale and cold .
“ Adieu , sir , ” she said .
“ Adieu , madame , ” replied the king ’ s attorney , as in an almost <unk> manner he conducted her to the door .
Then , turning to his desk , he said , striking the letter with the back of his right hand : “ Come , I had a <unk> , three <unk> , and two cases of <unk> , I only wanted a murder , and here it is .
It will be a splendid <unk> ! ” Chapter <unk> .
The <unk> As the procureur had told Madame Danglars , Valentine was not yet recovered .
<unk> down with fatigue , she was indeed confined to her bed ; and it was in her own room , and from the lips of Madame de Villefort , that she heard all the strange events we have related ; we mean the flight of Eugénie and the arrest of Andrea Cavalcanti , or rather Benedetto , together with the accusation of murder pronounced against him .
But Valentine was so weak that this <unk> scarcely produced the same effect it would have done had she been in her usual state of health .
Indeed , her brain was only the seat of vague ideas , and confused forms , mingled with strange fancies , alone presented themselves before her eyes .
During the <unk> Valentine ’ s <unk> remained tolerably clear , owing to the constant presence of M. Noirtier , who caused himself to be carried to his <unk> ’ s room , and watched her with his paternal tenderness ; Villefort also , on his return from the law <unk> , frequently passed an hour or two with his father and child .
At six o ’ clock Villefort retired to his study , at eight M. d ’ Avrigny himself arrived , bringing the night draught prepared for the young girl , and then M. Noirtier was carried away .
A nurse of the doctor ’ s choice succeeded them , and never left till about ten or eleven o ’ clock , when Valentine was asleep .
As she went downstairs she gave the keys of Valentine ’ s room to M. de Villefort , so that no one could reach the <unk> excepting through that of Madame de Villefort and little Edward .
Every morning Morrel called on Noirtier to receive news of Valentine , and , extraordinary as it seemed , each day found him less uneasy .
Certainly , though Valentine still <unk> under dreadful nervous excitement , she was better ; and moreover , Monte Cristo had told him when , half <unk> , he had rushed to the count ’ s house , that if she were not dead in two hours she would be saved .
Now four days had elapsed , and Valentine still lived .
The nervous excitement of which we speak pursued Valentine even in her sleep , or rather in that state of <unk> which succeeded her waking hours ; it was then , in the silence of night , in the dim light shed from the <unk> lamp on the chimney-piece , that she saw the shadows pass and <unk> which <unk> over the bed of <unk> , and <unk> the fever with their trembling wings .
First she fancied she saw her <unk> threatening her , then Morrel stretched his arms towards her ; sometimes mere strangers , like the Count of Monte Cristo came to visit her ; even the very furniture , in these moments of delirium , seemed to move , and this state lasted till about three o ’ clock in the morning , when a deep , heavy slumber <unk> the young girl , from which she did not awake till daylight .
On the evening of the day on which Valentine had learned of the flight of Eugénie and the arrest of Benedetto , — Villefort having retired as well as Noirtier and d ’ Avrigny , — her thoughts wandered in a confused <unk> , <unk> <unk> her own situation and the events she had just heard .
<unk> o ’ clock had struck .
The nurse , having placed the <unk> prepared by the doctor within reach of the patient , and locked the door , was listening with terror to the <unk> of the servants in the kitchen , and <unk> her memory with all the horrible stories which had for some months past amused the <unk> of the <unk> in the house of the king ’ s attorney .
Meanwhile an unexpected scene was passing in the room which had been so carefully locked .
Ten minutes had elapsed since the nurse had left ; Valentine , who for the last hour had been suffering from the fever which returned <unk> , incapable of <unk> her ideas , was forced to yield to the excitement which exhausted itself in <unk> and <unk> a succession and <unk> of the same fancies and <unk> .
The <unk> threw out <unk> rays , each <unk> itself into some strange form to her <unk> imagination , when suddenly by its <unk> light Valentine thought she saw the door of her library , which was in the <unk> by the chimney-piece , open slowly , though she in vain listened for the sound of the hinges on which it turned .
At any other time Valentine would have seized the <unk> <unk> and summoned assistance , but nothing astonished her in her present situation .
Her reason told her that all the <unk> she beheld were but the children of her imagination , and the conviction was <unk> by the fact that in the morning no traces remained of the nocturnal <unk> , who disappeared with the coming of daylight .
From behind the door a human figure appeared , but the girl was too familiar with such <unk> to be alarmed , and therefore only stared , hoping to recognize Morrel .
The figure advanced towards the bed and appeared to listen with profound attention .
At this moment a ray of light glanced across the face of the midnight visitor .
“ It is not he , ” she murmured , and waited , in the assurance that this was but a dream , for the man to disappear or assume some other form .
Still , she felt her pulse , and finding it <unk> violently she remembered that the best method of <unk> such <unk> was to drink , for a draught of the <unk> prepared by the doctor to <unk> her fever seemed to cause a <unk> of the brain , and for a short time she suffered less .
Valentine therefore reached her hand towards the glass , but as soon as her trembling arm left the bed the apparition advanced more quickly towards her , and approached the young girl so closely that she fancied she heard his breath , and felt the pressure of his hand .
This time the <unk> , or rather the reality , <unk> anything Valentine had before experienced ; she began to believe herself really alive and awake , and the belief that her reason was this time not deceived made her shudder .
The pressure she felt was evidently intended to arrest her arm , and she slowly withdrew it .
Then the figure , from whom she could not <unk> her eyes , and who appeared more <unk> than <unk> , took the glass , and walking towards the <unk> held it up , as if to <unk> its <unk> .
This did not seem sufficient ; the man , or rather the <unk> — for he <unk> so softly that no sound was heard — then poured out about a <unk> into the glass , and drank it .
Valentine witnessed this scene with a sentiment of <unk> .
Every minute she had expected that it would vanish and give place to another vision ; but the man , instead of <unk> like a shadow , again approached her , and said in an agitated voice , “ Now you may drink . ” Valentine shuddered .
It was the first time one of these <unk> had ever addressed her in a living voice , and she was about to utter an exclamation .
The man placed his finger on her lips .
“ The Count of Monte Cristo ! ” she murmured .
It was easy to see that no doubt now remained in the young girl ’ s mind as to the reality of the scene ; her eyes started with terror , her hands trembled , and she rapidly drew the <unk> closer to her .
Still , the presence of Monte Cristo at such an hour , his mysterious , <unk> , and extraordinary entrance into her room through the wall , might well seem <unk> to her <unk> reason .
“ Do not call anyone — do not be alarmed , ” said the count ; “ do not let a shade of suspicion or uneasiness remain in your breast ; the man standing before you , Valentine ( for this time it is no <unk> ) , is nothing more than the <unk> father and the most respectful friend you could dream of . ” Valentine could not reply ; the voice which indicated the real presence of a being in the room , alarmed her so much that she feared to utter a syllable ; still the expression of her eyes seemed to inquire , “ If your intentions are pure , why are you here ? ” The count ’ s marvellous <unk> understood all that was passing in the young girl ’ s mind .
“ Listen to me , ” he said , “ or , rather , look upon me ; look at my face , <unk> even than usual , and my eyes , red with <unk> — for four days I have not closed them , for I have been constantly watching you , to protect and preserve you for Maximilian . ” The blood mounted rapidly to the cheeks of Valentine , for the name just announced by the count <unk> all the fear with which his presence had inspired her .
“ Maximilian ! ” she exclaimed , and so sweet did the sound appear to her , that she repeated it — “ Maximilian ! — has he then owned all to you ? ” “ Everything .
He told me your life was his , and I have promised him that you shall live . ” “ You have promised him that I shall live ? ” “ Yes . ” “ But , sir , you spoke of <unk> and protection .
Are you a doctor ? ” “ Yes ; the best you could have at the present time , believe me . ” “ But you say you have watched ? ” said Valentine <unk> ; “ where have you been ? — I have not seen you . ” The count extended his hand towards the library .
“ I was hidden behind that door , ” he said , “ which leads into the next house , which I have <unk> . ” Valentine turned her eyes away , and , with an <unk> expression of pride and modest fear , exclaimed : “ Sir , I think you have been guilty of an <unk> <unk> , and that what you call protection is more like an insult . ” “ Valentine , ” he answered , “ during my long watch over you , all I have observed has been what people visited you , what <unk> was prepared , and what <unk> was served ; then , when the latter appeared dangerous to me , I entered , as I have now done , and <unk> , in the place of the poison , a <unk> draught ; which , instead of <unk> the death intended , caused life to <unk> in your veins . ” “ <unk> — death ! ” exclaimed Valentine , half believing herself under the influence of some feverish <unk> ; “ what are you saying , sir ? ” <unk> “ Hush , my child , ” said Monte Cristo , again placing his finger upon her lips , “ I did say poison and death .
But drink some of this ; ” and the count took a bottle from his pocket , containing a red <unk> , of which he poured a few drops into the glass .
“ <unk> this , and then take nothing more tonight . ” Valentine stretched out her hand , but scarcely had she touched the glass when she drew back in fear .
Monte Cristo took the glass , drank half its contents , and then presented it to Valentine , who smiled and swallowed the rest .
“ Oh , yes , ” she exclaimed , “ I recognize the <unk> of my nocturnal <unk> which <unk> me so much , and seemed to ease my <unk> brain .
Thank you , sir , thank you ! ” “ This is how you have lived during the last four nights , Valentine , ” said the count .
“ But , oh , how I passed that time !
Oh , the wretched hours I have endured — the torture to which I have <unk> when I saw the deadly poison poured into your glass , and how I trembled lest you should drink it before I could find time to throw it away ! ” “ Sir , ” said Valentine , at the height of her terror , “ you say you endured <unk> when you saw the deadly poison poured into my glass ; but if you saw this , you must also have seen the person who poured it ? ” “ Yes . ” Valentine raised herself in bed , and drew over her chest , which appeared <unk> than snow , the embroidered <unk> , still <unk> with the cold <unk> of delirium , to which were now added those of terror .
“ You saw the person ? ” repeated the young girl .
“ Yes , ” repeated the count .
“ What you tell me is horrible , sir .
You wish to make me believe something too dreadful .
What ? — attempt to murder me in my father ’ s house , in my room , on my bed of <unk> ?
Oh , leave me , sir ; you are <unk> me — you make me doubt the goodness of Providence — it is impossible , it cannot be ! ” “ Are you the first that this hand has <unk> ?
Have you not seen M. de Saint-Méran , Madame de Saint-Méran , Barrois , all fall ?
Would not M. Noirtier also have fallen a victim , had not the treatment he has been pursuing for the last three years <unk> the effects of the poison ? ” “ Oh , Heaven , ” said Valentine ; “ is this the reason why grandpapa has made me share all his <unk> during the last month ? ” “ And have they all <unk> of a slightly bitter <unk> , like that of dried <unk> ? ” “ Oh , yes , yes ! ” “ Then that <unk> all , ” said Monte Cristo .
“ Your grandfather knows , then , that a <unk> lives here ; perhaps he even <unk> the person .
He has been <unk> you , his beloved child , against the fatal effects of the poison , which has failed because your system was already <unk> with it .
But even this would have <unk> little against a more deadly medium of death employed four days ago , which is generally but too fatal . ” “ But who , then , is this assassin , this murderer ? ” “ Let me also ask you a question .
Have you never seen anyone enter your room at night ? ” “ Oh , yes ; I have frequently seen shadows pass close to me , approach , and disappear ; but I took them for <unk> raised by my feverish imagination , and indeed when you entered I thought I was under the influence of delirium . ” “ Then you do not know who it is that attempts your life ? ” <unk> “ No , ” said Valentine ; “ who could desire my death ? ” “ You shall know it now , then , ” said Monte Cristo , listening .
“ How do you mean ? ” said Valentine , looking anxiously around .
“ Because you are not feverish or <unk> tonight , but thoroughly awake ; midnight is striking , which is the hour <unk> choose . ” “ Oh , heavens , ” exclaimed Valentine , <unk> off the drops which ran down her forehead .
<unk> struck slowly and sadly ; every hour seemed to strike with <unk> weight upon the heart of the poor girl .
“ Valentine , ” said the count , “ summon up all your courage ; still the <unk> of your heart ; do not let a sound escape you , and <unk> to be asleep ; then you will see . ” Valentine seized the count ’ s hand .
“ I think I hear a noise , ” she said ; “ leave me . ” “ Good-bye , for the present , ” replied the count , walking upon <unk> towards the library door , and smiling with an expression so sad and paternal that the young girl ’ s heart was filled with gratitude .
Before closing the door he turned around once more , and said , “ Not a movement — not a word ; let them think you asleep , or perhaps you may be killed before I have the power of <unk> you . ” And with this fearful <unk> the count disappeared through the door , which <unk> closed after him .
Chapter <unk> .
<unk> Valentine was alone ; two other <unk> , <unk> than that of <unk> , struck the hour of midnight from different directions , and excepting the <unk> of a few carriages all was silent .
Then Valentine ’ s attention was <unk> by the clock in her room , which marked the seconds .
She began <unk> them , <unk> that they were much <unk> than the <unk> of her heart ; and still she doubted , — the <unk> Valentine could not imagine that anyone should desire her death .
Why should they ?
To what end ?
What had she done to excite the <unk> of an enemy ?
There was no fear of her falling asleep .
One terrible idea pressed upon her mind , — that someone existed in the world who had attempted to <unk> her , and who was about to endeavor to do so again .
<unk> this person , <unk> at the <unk> of the poison , should , as Monte Cristo <unk> , have <unk> to steel ! — What if the count should have no time to run to her <unk> ! — What if her last moments were approaching , and she should never again see Morrel !
When this terrible chain of ideas presented itself , Valentine was nearly persuaded to ring the bell , and call for help .
But through the door she fancied she saw the luminous eye of the count — that eye which lived in her memory , and the recollection overwhelmed her with so much shame that she asked herself whether any amount of gratitude could ever <unk> his <unk> and devoted friendship .
<unk> minutes , twenty <unk> minutes , passed thus , then ten more , and at last the clock struck the <unk> .
Just then the sound of <unk> slightly grating against the door of the library informed Valentine that the count was still watching , and recommended her to do the same ; at the same time , on the opposite side , that is towards Edward ’ s room , Valentine fancied that she heard the <unk> of the floor ; she listened attentively , holding her breath till she was nearly <unk> ; the lock turned , and the door slowly opened .
Valentine had raised herself upon her elbow , and had scarcely time to throw herself down on the bed and shade her eyes with her arm ; then , trembling , agitated , and her heart beating with indescribable terror , she awaited the event .
<unk> approached the bed and drew back the curtains .
Valentine summoned every effort , and breathed with that regular <unk> which <unk> tranquil sleep .
“ Valentine ! ” said a low voice .
The girl shuddered to the heart but did not reply .
“ Valentine , ” repeated the same voice .
Still silent : Valentine had promised not to wake .
Then everything was still , excepting that Valentine heard the almost <unk> sound of some <unk> being poured into the glass she had just <unk> .
Then she ventured to open her eyelids , and glance over her extended arm .
She saw a woman in a white <unk> <unk> a <unk> from a <unk> into her glass .
During this short time Valentine must have held her breath , or moved in some slight degree , for the woman , disturbed , stopped and leaned over the bed , in order the better to ascertain whether Valentine slept : it was Madame de Villefort .
On <unk> her <unk> , Valentine could not <unk> a shudder , which caused a <unk> in the bed .
Madame de Villefort instantly stepped back close to the wall , and there , <unk> by the <unk> , she silently and attentively watched the slightest movement of Valentine .
The latter recollected the terrible caution of Monte Cristo ; she fancied that the hand not holding the <unk> clasped a long sharp knife .
Then collecting all her remaining strength , she forced herself to close her eyes ; but this simple operation upon the most delicate <unk> of our frame , generally so easy to accomplish , became almost impossible at this moment , so much did curiosity struggle to retain the <unk> open and learn the truth .
Madame de Villefort , however , reassured by the silence , which was alone disturbed by the regular breathing of Valentine , again extended her hand , and half hidden by the curtains succeeded in <unk> the contents of the <unk> into the glass .
Then she retired so gently that Valentine did not know she had left the room .
She only witnessed the <unk> of the arm — the fair round arm of a woman but twenty-five years old , and who yet spread death around her .
<unk> It is impossible to describe the sensations experienced by Valentine during the minute and a half Madame de Villefort remained in the room .
The grating against the <unk> aroused the young girl from the <unk> in which she was plunged , and which almost <unk> to <unk> .
She raised her head with an effort .
The <unk> door again turned on its hinges , and the Count of Monte Cristo reappeared .
“ Well , ” said he , “ do you still doubt ? ” “ Oh , ” murmured the young girl .
“ Have you seen ? ” “ Alas ! ” “ Did you recognize ? ” Valentine <unk> .
“ Oh , yes ; ” she said , “ I saw , but I cannot believe ! ” “ Would you rather die , then , and cause Maximilian ’ s death ? ” “ Oh , ” repeated the young girl , almost bewildered , “ can I not leave the house ? — can I not escape ? ” “ Valentine , the hand which now <unk> you will pursue you everywhere ; your servants will be <unk> with gold , and death will be offered to you <unk> in every shape .
You will find it in the water you drink from the spring , in the fruit you <unk> from the tree . ” “ But did you not say that my kind grandfather ’ s precaution had <unk> the poison ? ” “ Yes , but not against a strong <unk> ; the poison will be changed , and the quantity increased . ” He took the glass and raised it to his lips .
“ It is already done , ” he said ; “ <unk> is no longer employed , but a simple <unk> !
I can recognize the <unk> of the <unk> in which it has been <unk> .
If you had taken what Madame de Villefort has poured into your glass , Valentine — Valentine — you would have been <unk> ! ” “ But , ” exclaimed the young girl , “ why am I thus pursued ? ” “ Why ? — are you so kind — so good — so <unk> of ill , that you cannot understand , Valentine ? ” “ No , I have never injured her . ” “ But you are rich , Valentine ; you have <unk> livres a year , and you prevent her son from <unk> these <unk> livres . ” “ How so ?
The fortune is not her gift , but is <unk> from my relations . ” “ Certainly ; and that is why M. and Madame de Saint-Méran have died ; that is why M. Noirtier was <unk> the day he made you his heir ; that is why you , in your turn , are to die — it is because your father would <unk> your property , and your brother , his only son , succeed to his . ” “ Edward ?
Poor child !
Are all these crimes committed on his account ? ” “ Ah , then you at length understand ? ” “ Heaven grant that this may not be visited upon him ! ” “ Valentine , you are an angel ! ” “ But why is my grandfather allowed to live ? ” “ It was considered , that you dead , the fortune would naturally <unk> to your brother , unless he were <unk> ; and besides , the crime appearing useless , it would be folly to commit it . ” “ And is it possible that this frightful <unk> of crimes has been invented by a woman ? ” “ Do you recollect in the <unk> of the Hôtel des <unk> , at <unk> , seeing a man in a brown cloak , whom your <unk> was <unk> upon _ <unk> <unk> _ ?
Well , ever since then , the <unk> project has been <unk> in her brain . ” “ Ah , then , indeed , sir , ” said the sweet girl , bathed in tears , “ I see that I am condemned to die ! ” “ No , Valentine , for I have <unk> all their <unk> ; no , your enemy is conquered since we know her , and you will live , Valentine — live to be happy yourself , and to <unk> happiness upon a noble heart ; but to <unk> this you must rely on me . ” “ <unk> me , sir — what am I to do ? ” “ You must <unk> take what I give you . ” “ Alas , were it only for my own sake , I should prefer to die ! ” “ You must not <unk> in anyone — not even in your father . ” “ My father is not engaged in this fearful plot , is he , sir ? ” asked Valentine , <unk> her hands .
“ No ; and yet your father , a man accustomed to <unk> <unk> , ought to have known that all these <unk> have not happened naturally ; it is he who should have watched over you — he should have occupied my place — he should have <unk> that glass — he should have risen against the assassin .
<unk> against spectre ! ” he murmured in a low voice , as he concluded his sentence .
“ Sir , ” said Valentine , “ I will do all I can to live , for there are two beings who love me and will die if I die — my grandfather and Maximilian . ” “ I will watch over them as I have over you . ” “ Well , sir , do as you will with me ; ” and then she added , in a low voice , “ oh , heavens , what will <unk> me ? ” “ Whatever may happen , Valentine , do not be alarmed ; though you suffer ; though you lose sight , hearing , consciousness , fear nothing ; though you should awake and be ignorant where you are , still do not fear ; even though you should find yourself in a <unk> vault or coffin .
<unk> yourself , then , and say to yourself : ‘ At this moment , a friend , a father , who lives for my happiness and that of Maximilian , <unk> over me ! ’ ” “ Alas , alas , what a fearful extremity ! ” “ Valentine , would you rather <unk> your <unk> ? ” “ I would rather die a hundred times — oh , yes , die ! ” “ No , you will not die ; but will you promise me , whatever happens , that you will not complain , but hope ? ” “ I will think of Maximilian ! ” “ You are my own darling child , Valentine !
I alone can save you , and I will . ” Valentine in the extremity of her terror joined her hands , — for she felt that the moment had arrived to ask for courage , — and began to pray , and while uttering little more than <unk> words , she forgot that her white shoulders had no other <unk> than her long hair , and that the <unk> of her heart could be seen through the lace of her <unk> .
Monte Cristo gently laid his hand on the young girl ’ s arm , drew the velvet <unk> close to her throat , and said with a paternal smile : “ My child , believe in my devotion to you as you believe in the goodness of Providence and the love of Maximilian . ” Valentine gave him a look full of gratitude , and remained as <unk> as a child .
Then he drew from his <unk> the little <unk> box , raised the golden <unk> , and took from it a <unk> about the size of a <unk> , which he placed in her hand .
She took it , and looked attentively on the count ; there was an expression on the face of her <unk> protector which commanded her <unk> .
She evidently <unk> him by her look .
“ Yes , ” said he .
Valentine carried the <unk> to her mouth , and swallowed it .
“ And now , my dear child , adieu for the present .
I will try and gain a little sleep , for you are saved . ” “ Go , ” said Valentine , “ whatever happens , I promise you not to fear . ” Monte Cristo for some time kept his eyes fixed on the young girl , who gradually fell asleep , <unk> to the effects of the <unk> the count had given her .
Then he took the glass , <unk> three parts of the contents in the fireplace , that it might be supposed Valentine had taken it , and replaced it on the table ; then he disappeared , after throwing a farewell glance on Valentine , who slept with the confidence and innocence of an angel at the feet of the Lord .
Chapter <unk> .
Valentine The <unk> continued to burn on the chimney-piece , <unk> the last drops of <unk> which <unk> on the surface of the water .
The <unk> of the lamp appeared of a <unk> hue , and the flame , <unk> before it <unk> , threw out the last <unk> which in an <unk> object have been so often compared with the <unk> of a human creature in its final <unk> .
A dull and <unk> light was shed over the <unk> and curtains <unk> the young girl .
All noise in the streets had ceased , and the silence was frightful .
It was then that the door of Edward ’ s room opened , and a head we have before noticed appeared in the glass opposite ; it was Madame de Villefort , who came to witness the effects of the drink she had prepared .
She stopped in the <unk> , listened for a moment to the <unk> of the lamp , the only sound in that deserted room , and then advanced to the table to see if Valentine ’ s glass were empty .
It was still about a quarter full , as we before stated .
Madame de Villefort <unk> the contents into the ashes , which she disturbed that they might the more readily <unk> the <unk> ; then she carefully <unk> the glass , and <unk> it with her handkerchief replaced it on the table .
If anyone could have looked into the room just then he would have noticed the hesitation with which Madame de Villefort approached the bed and looked <unk> on Valentine .
The dim light , the profound silence , and the gloomy thoughts inspired by the hour , and still more by her own conscience , all combined to produce a sensation of fear ; the <unk> was terrified at the contemplation of her own work .
At length she <unk> , drew aside the curtain , and leaning over the pillow gazed intently on Valentine .
The young girl no longer breathed , no breath <unk> through the <unk> teeth ; the white lips no longer <unk> — the eyes were <unk> with a <unk> <unk> , and the long black <unk> rested on a cheek white as wax .
Madame de Villefort gazed upon the face so expressive even in its <unk> ; then she ventured to raise the <unk> and press her hand upon the young girl ’ s heart .
It was cold and motionless .
She only felt the <unk> in her own fingers , and withdrew her hand with a shudder .
One arm was hanging out of the bed ; from shoulder to elbow it was <unk> after the arms of <unk> <unk> ’ s “ <unk> , ” <unk> but the <unk> seemed to be slightly <unk> by <unk> , and the hand , so <unk> formed , was resting with stiff <unk> fingers on the <unk> of the bed .
The nails , too , were turning blue .
Madame de Villefort had no longer any doubt ; all was over — she had <unk> the last terrible work she had to accomplish .
There was no more to do in the room , so the <unk> retired <unk> , as though fearing to hear the sound of her own footsteps ; but as she withdrew she still held aside the curtain , absorbed in the irresistible <unk> always <unk> by the picture of death , so long as it is merely mysterious and does not excite disgust .
The minutes passed ; Madame de Villefort could not drop the curtain which she held like a funeral <unk> over the head of Valentine .
She was lost in reverie , and the reverie of crime is remorse .
Just then the lamp again <unk> ; the noise startled Madame de Villefort , who shuddered and dropped the curtain .
<unk> afterwards the light <unk> , and the room was plunged in frightful obscurity , while the clock at that minute struck half-past four .
<unk> with agitation , the <unk> succeeded in <unk> her way to the door , and reached her room in an agony of fear .
The darkness lasted two hours longer ; then by degrees a cold light crept through the <unk> <unk> , until at length it revealed the objects in the room .
About this time the nurse ’ s <unk> was heard on the stairs and the woman entered the room with a cup in her hand .
To the tender eye of a father or a lover , the first glance would have sufficed to reveal Valentine ’ s condition ; but to this <unk> , Valentine only appeared to sleep .
“ Good , ” she exclaimed , approaching the table , “ she has taken part of her draught ; the glass is <unk> empty . ” Then she went to the fireplace and lit the fire , and although she had just left her bed , she could not resist the temptation offered by Valentine ’ s sleep , so she threw herself into an armchair to <unk> a little more rest .
The clock striking eight awoke her .
<unk> at the prolonged slumber of the patient , and frightened to see that the arm was still hanging out of the bed , she advanced towards Valentine , and for the first time noticed the white lips .
She tried to replace the arm , but it moved with a frightful <unk> which could not deceive a <unk> .
She <unk> aloud ; then running to the door exclaimed : “ <unk> , help ! ” <unk> “ What is the matter ? ” asked M. d ’ Avrigny , at the foot of the stairs , it being the hour he usually visited her .
“ What is it ? ” asked Villefort , rushing from his room .
“ <unk> , do you hear them call for help ? ” “ Yes , yes ; let us hasten up ; it was in Valentine ’ s room . ” But before the doctor and the father could reach the room , the servants who were on the same floor had entered , and seeing Valentine pale and motionless on her bed , they lifted up their hands towards heaven and stood <unk> , as though struck by <unk> .
“ <unk> Madame de Villefort ! — <unk> Madame de Villefort ! ” cried the procureur from the door of his chamber , which apparently he scarcely dared to leave .
But instead of <unk> him , the servants stood watching M. d ’ Avrigny , who ran to Valentine , and raised her in his arms .
“ What ? — this one , too ? ” he exclaimed .
“ Oh , where will be the end ? ” Villefort rushed into the room .
“ What are you saying , doctor ? ” he exclaimed , raising his hands to heaven .
“ I say that Valentine is dead ! ” replied d ’ Avrigny , in a voice terrible in its solemn calmness .
<unk> M. de Villefort <unk> and buried his head in the bed .
On the exclamation of the doctor and the cry of the father , the servants all fled with muttered <unk> ; they were heard running down the stairs and through the long <unk> , then there was a rush in the court , afterwards all was still ; they had , one and all , deserted the <unk> house .
Just then , Madame de Villefort , in the act of <unk> on her <unk> , threw aside the <unk> and for a moment stood motionless , as though <unk> the <unk> of the room , while she endeavored to call up some <unk> tears .
On a sudden she stepped , or rather bounded , with <unk> arms , towards the table .
She saw d ’ Avrigny <unk> examining the glass , which she felt certain of having <unk> during the night .
It was now a third full , just as it was when she threw the contents into the ashes .
The spectre of Valentine rising before the <unk> would have alarmed her less .
It was , indeed , the same color as the draught she had poured into the glass , and which Valentine had drunk ; it was indeed the poison , which could not deceive M. d ’ Avrigny , which he now examined so closely ; it was doubtless a miracle from heaven , that , notwithstanding her precautions , there should be some trace , some proof remaining to reveal the crime .
While Madame de Villefort remained <unk> to the spot like a statue of terror , and Villefort , with his head hidden in the <unk> , saw nothing around him , d ’ Avrigny approached the window , that he might the better examine the contents of the glass , and <unk> the <unk> of his finger in , <unk> it .
“ Ah , ” he exclaimed , “ it is no longer <unk> that is used ; let me see what it is ! ” Then he ran to one of the <unk> in Valentine ’ s room , which had been <unk> into a <unk> <unk> , and taking from its silver case a small bottle of <unk> <unk> , dropped a little of it into the <unk> , which immediately changed to a <unk> color .
“ Ah , ” exclaimed d ’ Avrigny , in a voice in which the horror of a judge <unk> the truth was mingled with the delight of a <unk> making a discovery .
Madame de Villefort was <unk> ; her eyes first <unk> and then <unk> , she <unk> towards the door and disappeared .
<unk> afterwards the distant sound of a heavy weight falling on the ground was heard , but no one paid any attention to it ; the nurse was engaged in watching the <unk> <unk> , and Villefort was still absorbed in grief .
M. d ’ Avrigny alone had followed Madame de Villefort with his eyes , and watched her hurried retreat .
He lifted up the <unk> over the entrance to Edward ’ s room , and his eye reaching as far as Madame de Villefort ’ s apartment , he beheld her extended <unk> on the floor .
“ Go to the assistance of Madame de Villefort , ” he said to the nurse .
“ Madame de Villefort is ill . ” <unk> “ But Mademoiselle de Villefort — — ” stammered the nurse .
“ Mademoiselle de Villefort no longer requires help , ” said d ’ Avrigny , “ since she is dead . ” “ <unk> , — dead ! ” <unk> forth Villefort , in a <unk> of grief , which was the more terrible from the <unk> of the sensation in the iron heart of that man .
“ <unk> ! ” repeated a third voice .
“ Who said Valentine was dead ? ” The two men turned round , and saw Morrel standing at the door , pale and <unk> .
This is what had happened .
At the usual time , Morrel had presented himself at the little door leading to Noirtier ’ s room .
<unk> to custom , the door was open , and having no occasion to ring he entered .
He waited for a moment in the hall and called for a servant to conduct him to M. Noirtier ; but no one answered , the servants having , as we know , deserted the house .
Morrel had no particular reason for uneasiness ; Monte Cristo had promised him that Valentine should live , and so far he had always <unk> his word .
Every night the count had given him news , which was the next morning confirmed by Noirtier .
Still this extraordinary silence appeared strange to him , and he called a second and third time ; still no answer .
Then he determined to go up .
Noirtier ’ s room was opened , like all the rest .
The first thing he saw was the old man sitting in his armchair in his usual place , but his eyes expressed alarm , which was confirmed by the pallor which <unk> his features .
“ How are you , sir ? ” asked Morrel , with a <unk> of heart .
“ Well , ” answered the old man , by closing his eyes ; but his appearance manifested increasing uneasiness .
“ You are thoughtful , sir , ” continued Morrel ; “ you want something ; shall I call one of the servants ? ” “ Yes , ” replied Noirtier .
Morrel pulled the bell , but though he nearly broke the <unk> no one answered .
He turned towards Noirtier ; the pallor and anguish expressed on his countenance <unk> increased .
“ Oh , ” exclaimed Morrel , “ why do they not come ?
Is anyone ill in the house ? ” The eyes of Noirtier seemed as though they would start from their <unk> .
“ What is the matter ?
You alarm me .
Valentine ?
Valentine ? ” “ Yes , yes , ” signed Noirtier .
Maximilian tried to speak , but he could <unk> nothing ; he <unk> , and supported himself against the <unk> .
Then he pointed to the door .
“ Yes , yes , yes ! ” continued the old man .
<unk> Maximilian rushed up the little staircase , while Noirtier ’ s eyes seemed to say , — “ <unk> , <unk> ! ” In a minute the young man darted through several rooms , till at length he reached Valentine ’ s .
There was no occasion to <unk> the door , it was wide open .
A sob was the only sound he heard .
He saw as though in a mist , a black figure kneeling and buried in a confused mass of white <unk> .
A terrible fear <unk> him .
It was then he heard a voice <unk> “ Valentine is dead ! ” and another voice which , like an <unk> repeated : “ <unk> , — dead ! ” <unk> Chapter <unk> .
Maximilian Villefort rose , <unk> of being surprised in such a <unk> of grief .
The terrible office he had held for twenty-five years had succeeded in making him more or less than man .
His glance , at first wandering , fixed itself upon Morrel .
“ Who are you , sir , ” he asked , “ that forget that this is not the manner to enter a house <unk> with death ?
Go , sir , go ! ” But Morrel remained motionless ; he could not <unk> his eyes from that <unk> bed , and the pale corpse of the young girl who was lying on it .
“ Go ! — do you hear ? ” said Villefort , while d ’ Avrigny advanced to lead Morrel out .
Maximilian stared for a moment at the corpse , gazed all around the room , then upon the two men ; he opened his mouth to speak , but finding it impossible to give utterance to the <unk> ideas that occupied his brain , he went out , <unk> his hands through his hair in such a manner that Villefort and d ’ Avrigny , for a moment <unk> from the <unk> <unk> , exchanged glances , which seemed to say , — “ He is mad ! ” But in less than five minutes the staircase <unk> beneath an extraordinary weight .
Morrel was seen carrying , with <unk> strength , the armchair containing Noirtier upstairs .
When he reached the landing he placed the armchair on the floor and rapidly rolled it into Valentine ’ s room .
This could only have been accomplished by means of <unk> strength supplied by powerful excitement .
But the most fearful spectacle was Noirtier being pushed towards the bed , his face expressing all his meaning , and his eyes <unk> the want of every other <unk> .
That pale face and <unk> glance appeared to Villefort like a frightful apparition .
Each time he had been brought into contact with his father , something terrible had happened .
“ See what they have done ! ” cried Morrel , with one hand leaning on the back of the chair , and the other extended towards Valentine .
“ See , my father , see ! ” Villefort drew back and looked with astonishment on the young man , who , almost a stranger to him , called Noirtier his father .
At this moment the whole soul of the old man seemed <unk> in his eyes which became <unk> ; the veins of the throat <unk> ; his cheeks and <unk> became purple , as though he was struck with <unk> ; nothing was wanting to complete this but the utterance of a cry .
And the cry <unk> from his <unk> , if we may thus speak — a cry frightful in its silence .
D ’ Avrigny rushed towards the old man and made him <unk> a powerful <unk> .
“ Sir , ” cried Morrel , seizing the <unk> hand of the <unk> , “ they ask me who I am , and what right I have to be here .
Oh , you know it , tell them , tell them ! ” And the young man ’ s voice was <unk> by sobs .
As for the old man , his chest <unk> with his <unk> <unk> .
One could have thought that he was <unk> the <unk> preceding death .
At length , happier than the young man , who <unk> without weeping , tears <unk> in the eyes of Noirtier .
“ Tell them , ” said Morrel in a hoarse voice , “ tell them that I am her betrothed .
Tell them she was my beloved , my noble girl , my only blessing in the world .
Tell them — oh , tell them , that corpse belongs to me ! ” The young man overwhelmed by the weight of his anguish , fell heavily on his knees before the bed , which his fingers grasped with <unk> energy .
D ’ Avrigny , unable to bear the sight of this touching emotion , turned away ; and Villefort , without seeking any further explanation , and attracted towards him by the irresistible <unk> which <unk> us towards those who have loved the people for whom we <unk> , extended his hand towards the young man .
But Morrel saw nothing ; he had grasped the hand of Valentine , and unable to weep <unk> his agony in <unk> as he bit the sheets .
For some time nothing was heard in that chamber but sobs , <unk> , and prayers .
At length Villefort , the most composed of all , spoke : “ Sir , ” said he to Maximilian , “ you say you loved Valentine , that you were betrothed to her .
I knew nothing of this engagement , of this love , yet I , her father , forgive you , for I see that your grief is real and deep ; and besides my own sorrow is too great for anger to find a place in my heart .
But you see that the angel whom you hoped for has left this earth — she has nothing more to do with the <unk> of men .
Take a last farewell , sir , of her sad remains ; take the hand you expected to possess once more within your own , and then separate yourself from her forever .
Valentine now requires only the <unk> of the priest . ” <unk> “ You are mistaken , sir , ” exclaimed Morrel , raising himself on one knee , his heart pierced by a more <unk> <unk> than any he had yet felt — “ you are mistaken ; Valentine , dying as she has , not only requires a priest , but an <unk> .
_ You _ , M. de Villefort , send for the priest ; _ I _ will be the <unk> . ” “ What do you mean , sir ? ” asked Villefort , trembling at the new idea inspired by the delirium of Morrel .
“ I tell you , sir , that two persons exist in you ; the father has <unk> sufficiently , now let the procureur fulfil his office . ” The eyes of Noirtier <unk> , and d ’ Avrigny approached .
“ Gentlemen , ” said Morrel , reading all that passed through the minds of the witnesses to the scene , “ I know what I am saying , and you know as well as I do what I am about to say — Valentine has been assassinated ! ” Villefort hung his head , d ’ Avrigny approached nearer , and Noirtier said “ Yes ” with his eyes .
“ Now , sir , ” continued Morrel , “ in these days no one can disappear by violent means without some inquiries being made as to the cause of her disappearance , even were she not a young , beautiful , and <unk> creature like Valentine .
Now , M. le <unk> du <unk> , ” said Morrel with increasing <unk> , “ no mercy is allowed ; I <unk> the crime ; it is your place to seek the assassin . ” The young man ’ s <unk> eyes <unk> Villefort , who , on his side , glanced from Noirtier to d ’ Avrigny .
But instead of finding sympathy in the eyes of the doctor and his father , he only saw an expression as <unk> as that of Maximilian .
“ Yes , ” indicated the old man .
“ <unk> , ” said d ’ Avrigny .
“ Sir , ” said Villefort , <unk> to struggle against this <unk> force and his own emotion , — “ sir , you are deceived ; no one <unk> crimes here .
I am <unk> by fate .
It is horrible , indeed , but no one <unk> . ” The eyes of Noirtier lighted up with rage , and d ’ Avrigny prepared to speak .
Morrel , however , extended his arm , and commanded silence .
“ And I say that <unk> _ are _ committed here , ” said Morrel , whose voice , though lower in tone , lost none of its terrible <unk> : “ I tell you that this is the fourth victim within the last four months .
I tell you , Valentine ’ s life was attempted by poison four days ago , though she escaped , owing to the precautions of M. Noirtier .
I tell you that the <unk> has been double , the poison changed , and that this time it has succeeded .
I tell you that you know these things as well as I do , since this gentleman has <unk> you , both as a doctor and as a friend . ” “ Oh , you <unk> , sir , ” exclaimed Villefort , in vain endeavoring to escape the <unk> in which he was taken .
<unk> “ I <unk> ? ” said Morrel ; “ well , then , I appeal to M. d ’ Avrigny himself .
<unk> him , sir , if he <unk> the words he uttered in the garden of this house on the night of Madame de Saint-Méran ’ s death .
You thought yourselves alone , and talked about that <unk> death , and the fatality you mentioned then is the same which has caused the murder of Valentine . ” Villefort and d ’ Avrigny exchanged looks .
“ Yes , yes , ” continued Morrel ; “ recall the scene , for the words you thought were only given to silence and solitude fell into my ears .
Certainly , after <unk> the <unk> <unk> manifested by M. de Villefort towards his own relations , I ought to have <unk> him to the authorities ; then I should not have been an <unk> to thy death , as I now am , sweet , beloved Valentine ; but the <unk> shall become the <unk> .
This fourth murder is apparent to all , and if thy father abandon thee , Valentine , it is I , and I swear it , that shall pursue the assassin . ” And this time , as though nature had at least taken compassion on the <unk> frame , nearly <unk> with its own strength , the words of Morrel were stifled in his throat ; his breast <unk> ; the tears , so long <unk> , <unk> from his eyes ; and he threw himself weeping on his knees by the side of the bed .
Then d ’ Avrigny spoke .
“ And I , too , ” he exclaimed in a low voice , “ I <unk> with M. Morrel in <unk> justice for crime ; my blood <unk> at the idea of having encouraged a murderer by my <unk> <unk> . ” “ Oh , <unk> <unk> ! ” murmured Villefort .
Morrel raised his head , and reading the eyes of the old man , which <unk> with <unk> <unk> , — “ Stay , ” he said , “ M.
Noirtier wishes to speak . ” “ Yes , ” indicated Noirtier , with an expression the more terrible , from all his <unk> being <unk> in his glance .
“ Do you know the assassin ? ” asked Morrel .
“ Yes , ” replied Noirtier .
“ And will you direct us ? ” exclaimed the young man .
“ Listen , M. d ’ Avrigny , listen ! ” Noirtier looked upon Morrel with one of those melancholy smiles which had so often made Valentine happy , and thus fixed his attention .
Then , having <unk> the eyes of his <unk> on his own , he glanced towards the door .
“ Do you wish me to leave ? ” said Morrel , sadly .
“ Yes , ” replied Noirtier .
“ Alas , alas , sir , have pity on me ! ” The old man ’ s eyes remained fixed on the door .
“ May I , at least , return ? ” asked Morrel .
“ Yes . ” “ <unk> I leave alone ? ” “ No . ” “ <unk> am I to take with me ?
The procureur ? ” “ No . ” “ The doctor ? ” “ Yes . ” “ You wish to remain alone with M. de Villefort ? ” “ Yes . ” “ But can he understand you ? ” “ Yes . ” “ Oh , ” said Villefort , <unk> delighted to think that the inquiries were to be made by him alone , — “ oh , be satisfied , I can understand my father . ” While uttering these words with this expression of joy , his teeth <unk> together violently .
D ’ Avrigny took the young man ’ s arm , and led him out of the room .
A more than <unk> silence then reigned in the house .
At the end of a quarter of an hour a <unk> <unk> was heard , and Villefort appeared at the door of the apartment where d ’ Avrigny and Morrel had been staying , one absorbed in meditation , the other in grief .
“ You can come , ” he said , and led them back to Noirtier .
Morrel looked attentively on Villefort .
His face was livid , large drops rolled down his face , and in his fingers he held the <unk> of a <unk> pen which he had torn to <unk> .
“ Gentlemen , ” he said in a hoarse voice , “ give me your word of honor that this horrible secret shall forever remain buried amongst ourselves ! ” The two men drew back .
“ I entreat you — — ” continued Villefort .
“ But , ” said Morrel , “ the <unk> — the murderer — the assassin . ” “ Do not alarm yourself , sir ; justice will be done , ” said Villefort .
“ My father has revealed the <unk> ’ s name ; my father <unk> for revenge as much as you do , yet even he <unk> you as I do to keep this secret .
Do you not , father ? ” “ Yes , ” resolutely replied Noirtier .
Morrel suffered an exclamation of horror and surprise to escape him .
“ Oh , sir , ” said Villefort , <unk> Maximilian by the arm , “ if my father , the <unk> man , makes this request , it is because he knows , be assured , that Valentine will be terribly <unk> .
Is it not so , father ? ” The old man made a sign in the <unk> .
Villefort continued : “ He knows me , and I have <unk> my word to him .
<unk> assured , gentlemen , that within three days , in a less time than justice would demand , the revenge I shall have taken for the murder of my child will be such as to make the <unk> heart tremble ; ” and as he spoke these words he ground his teeth , and grasped the old man ’ s <unk> hand .
“ Will this promise be <unk> , M. Noirtier ? ” asked Morrel , while d ’ Avrigny looked <unk> .
“ Yes , ” replied Noirtier with an expression of sinister joy .
“ <unk> , then , ” said Villefort , <unk> the hands of Morrel and d ’ Avrigny , “ swear that you will spare the honor of my house , and leave me to <unk> my child . ” D ’ Avrigny turned round and uttered a very feeble “ Yes , ” but Morrel , <unk> his hand , rushed to the bed , and after having pressed the cold lips of Valentine with his own , <unk> left , uttering a long , deep groan of despair and anguish .
We have before stated that all the servants had fled .
M. de Villefort was therefore obliged to request M. d ’ Avrigny to <unk> all the arrangements <unk> upon a death in a large city , more especially a death under such suspicious circumstances .
It was something terrible to witness the silent agony , the mute despair of Noirtier , whose tears silently rolled down his cheeks .
Villefort retired to his study , and d ’ Avrigny left to summon the doctor of the <unk> , whose office it is to examine bodies after <unk> , and who is <unk> named “ the doctor of the dead . ” M. Noirtier could not be persuaded to quit his <unk> .
At the end of a quarter of an hour M. d ’ Avrigny returned with his <unk> ; they found the outer gate closed , and not a servant remaining in the house ; Villefort himself was obliged to open to them .
But he stopped on the landing ; he had not the courage to again visit the death chamber .
The two <unk> , therefore , entered the room alone .
Noirtier was near the bed , pale , motionless , and silent as the corpse .
The <unk> doctor approached with the indifference of a man accustomed to spend half his time amongst the dead ; he then lifted the sheet which was placed over the face , and just <unk> the lips .
“ Alas , ” said d ’ Avrigny , “ she is indeed dead , poor child ! ” <unk> “ Yes , ” answered the doctor <unk> , <unk> the sheet he had raised .
Noirtier uttered a kind of hoarse , <unk> sound ; the old man ’ s eyes <unk> , and the good doctor understood that he wished to behold his child .
He therefore approached the bed , and while his companion was <unk> the fingers with which he had touched the lips of the corpse in <unk> of <unk> , he <unk> the calm and pale face , which looked like that of a sleeping angel .
A tear , which appeared in the old man ’ s eye , expressed his thanks to the doctor .
The doctor of the dead then laid his permit on the corner of the table , and having <unk> his duty , was conducted out by d ’ Avrigny .
Villefort met them at the door of his study ; having in a few words thanked the <unk> doctor , he turned to d ’ Avrigny , and said : “ And now the priest . ” “ Is there any particular priest you wish to pray with Valentine ? ” asked d ’ Avrigny .
“ No . ” said Villefort ; “ fetch the nearest . ” “ The nearest , ” said the <unk> doctor , “ is a good Italian abbé , who lives next door to you .
Shall I call on him as I pass ? ” “ D ’ Avrigny , ” said Villefort , “ be so kind , I <unk> you , as to accompany this gentleman .
Here is the key of the door , so that you can go in and out as you please ; you will bring the priest with you , and will oblige me by <unk> him into my child ’ s room . ” <unk> “ Do you wish to see him ? ” “ I only wish to be alone .
You will excuse me , will you not ?
A priest can understand a father ’ s grief . ” And M. de Villefort , giving the key to d ’ Avrigny , again bade farewell to the strange doctor , and retired to his study , where he began to work .
For some <unk> work is a remedy for all <unk> .
As the <unk> entered the street , they saw a man in a <unk> standing on the threshold of the next door .
“ This is the abbé of whom I spoke , ” said the doctor to d ’ Avrigny .
D ’ Avrigny <unk> the priest .
“ Sir , ” he said , “ are you disposed to <unk> a great <unk> on an unhappy father who has just lost his daughter ?
I mean M. de Villefort , the king ’ s attorney . ” “ Ah , ” said the priest , in a marked Italian accent ; “ yes , I have heard that death is in that house . ” “ Then I need not tell you what kind of service he requires of you . ” “ I was about to offer myself , sir , ” said the priest ; “ it is our mission to <unk> our duties . ” “ It is a young girl . ” “ I know it , sir ; the servants who fled from the house informed me .
I also know that her name is Valentine , and I have already <unk> for her . ” “ Thank you , sir , ” said d ’ Avrigny ; “ since you have <unk> your sacred office , <unk> to continue it .
Come and watch by the dead , and all the wretched family will be grateful to you . ” “ I am going , sir ; and I do not hesitate to say that no prayers will be more <unk> than mine . ” D ’ Avrigny took the priest ’ s hand , and without meeting Villefort , who was engaged in his study , they reached Valentine ’ s room , which on the following night was to be occupied by the <unk> .
On entering the room , Noirtier ’ s eyes met those of the abbé , and no doubt he read some particular expression in them , for he remained in the room .
D ’ Avrigny recommended the attention of the priest to the living as well as to the dead , and the abbé promised to <unk> his prayers to Valentine and his attentions to Noirtier .
In order , doubtless , that he might not be disturbed while <unk> his sacred mission , the priest rose as soon as d ’ Avrigny departed , and not only <unk> the door through which the doctor had just left , but also that leading to Madame de Villefort ’ s room .
Chapter <unk> .
Danglars ’ <unk> The next morning <unk> dull and <unk> .
During the night the <unk> had executed their melancholy office , and wrapped the corpse in the <unk> , which , whatever may be said about the <unk> of death , is at least a last proof of the luxury so pleasing in life .
This <unk> was nothing more than a beautiful piece of <unk> , which the young girl had bought a fortnight before .
During the evening two men , engaged for the purpose , had carried Noirtier from Valentine ’ s room into his own , and contrary to all expectation there was no difficulty in <unk> him from his child .
The Abbé Busoni had watched till daylight , and then left without calling anyone .
D ’ Avrigny returned about eight o ’ clock in the morning ; he met Villefort on his way to Noirtier ’ s room , and accompanied him to see how the old man had slept .
They found him in the large armchair , which served him for a bed , <unk> a calm , nay , almost a smiling sleep .
They both stood in amazement at the door .
“ See , ” said d ’ Avrigny to Villefort , “ nature knows how to <unk> the <unk> sorrow .
No one can say that M. Noirtier did not love his child , and yet he <unk> . ” “ Yes , you are right , ” replied Villefort , surprised ; “ he <unk> , indeed !
And this is the more strange , since the least <unk> keeps him awake all night . ” “ <unk> has <unk> him , ” replied d ’ Avrigny ; and they both returned <unk> to the procureur ’ s study .
“ See , I have not slept , ” said Villefort , showing his <unk> bed ; “ grief does not <unk> me .
I have not been in bed for two nights ; but then look at my desk ; see what I have written during these two days and nights .
I have filled those papers , and have made out the accusation against the assassin Benedetto .
Oh , work , work , — my passion , my joy , my delight , — it is for thee to <unk> my sorrows ! ” and he convulsively grasped the hand of d ’ Avrigny .
“ Do you require my services now ? ” asked d ’ Avrigny .
“ No , ” said Villefort ; “ only return again at eleven o ’ clock ; at twelve the — the — oh , <unk> , my poor , poor child ! ” and the procureur again becoming a man , lifted up his eyes and <unk> .
“ Shall you be present in the <unk> ? ” “ No ; I have a cousin who has <unk> this sad office .
I shall work , doctor — when I work I forget everything . ” And , indeed , no sooner had the doctor left the room , than he was again absorbed in work .
On the <unk> d ’ Avrigny met the cousin whom Villefort had mentioned , a personage as <unk> in our story as in the world he occupied — one of those beings <unk> from their birth to make themselves useful to others .
He was <unk> , dressed in black , with <unk> around his hat , and presented himself at his cousin ’ s with a face made up for the occasion , and which he could alter as might be required .
At eleven o ’ clock the <unk> rolled into the <unk> court , and the Rue du Faubourg <unk> was filled with a crowd of <unk> , equally pleased to witness the <unk> or the mourning of the rich , and who rush with the same <unk> to a funeral procession as to the marriage of a <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> filled , and some of our old friends made their appearance — we mean Debray , Château-Renaud , and Beauchamp , accompanied by all the leading men of the day at the bar , in <unk> , or the army , for M. de Villefort moved in the first Parisian <unk> , less owing to his social position than to his personal merit .
The cousin standing at the door <unk> in the guests , and it was rather a relief to the indifferent to see a person as <unk> as themselves , and who did not exact a mournful face or force tears , as would have been the case with a father , a brother , or a lover .
Those who were acquainted soon formed into little groups .
One of them was made of Debray , Château-Renaud , and Beauchamp .
“ Poor girl , ” said Debray , like the rest , paying an <unk> <unk> to the sad event , — “ poor girl , so young , so rich , so beautiful !
Could you have imagined this scene , Château-Renaud , when we saw her , at the most three weeks ago , about to sign that contract ? ” “ Indeed , no , ” said Château-Renaud . ” “ Did you know her ? ” “ I spoke to her once or twice at Madame de Morcerf ’ s , among the rest ; she appeared to me charming , though rather melancholy .
Where is her <unk> ?
Do you know ? ” “ She is <unk> the day with the wife of the worthy gentleman who is receiving us . ” <unk> “ Who is he ? ” “ <unk> do you mean ? ” “ The gentleman who <unk> us ?
Is he a deputy ? ” “ Oh , no .
I am condemned to witness those gentlemen every day , ” said Beauchamp ; “ but he is perfectly unknown to me . ” “ Have you mentioned this death in your paper ? ” “ It has been mentioned , but the article is not mine ; indeed , I doubt if it will please M. Villefort , for it says that if four <unk> <unk> had happened anywhere else than in the house of the king ’ s attorney , he would have interested himself somewhat more about it . ” “ Still , ” said Château-Renaud , “ Dr.
d ’ Avrigny , who <unk> my mother , <unk> he is in despair about it .
But whom are you seeking , Debray ? ” “ I am seeking the Count of Monte Cristo ” said the young man .
“ I met him on the boulevard , on my way here , ” said Beauchamp .
“ I think he is about to leave Paris ; he was going to his banker . ” “ His banker ?
Danglars is his banker , is he not ? ” asked Château-Renaud of Debray .
“ I believe so , ” replied the secretary with slight uneasiness .
“ But Monte Cristo is not the only one I miss here ; I do not see Morrel . ” “ Morrel ?
Do they know him ? ” asked Château-Renaud .
“ I think he has only been introduced to Madame de Villefort . ” “ Still , he ought to have been here , ” said Debray ; “ I wonder what will be talked about tonight ; this funeral is the news of the day .
But <unk> , here comes our minister of justice ; he will feel obliged to make some little speech to the cousin , ” and the three young men drew near to listen .
Beauchamp told the truth when he said that on his way to the funeral he had met Monte Cristo , who was <unk> his steps towards the Rue de la <unk> d ’ <unk> , to M. Danglars ’ .
The banker saw the carriage of the count enter the courtyard , and advanced to meet him with a sad , though <unk> smile .
“ Well , ” said he , extending his hand to Monte Cristo , “ I suppose you have come to <unk> with me , for indeed misfortune has taken possession of my house .
When I perceived you , I was just asking myself whether I had not wished harm towards those poor <unk> , which would have <unk> the <unk> of ‘ He who wishes misfortunes to happen to others <unk> them himself . ’ Well , on my word of honor , I answered , ‘ No ! ’ I wished no ill to Morcerf ; he was a little proud , perhaps , for a man who like myself has risen from nothing ; but we all have our faults .
Do you know , count , that persons of our time of life — not that you belong to the class , you are still a young man , — but as I was saying , persons of our time of life have been very unfortunate this year .
For example , look at the <unk> procureur , who has just lost his daughter , and in fact nearly all his family , in so singular a manner ; Morcerf <unk> and dead ; and then myself covered with <unk> through the <unk> of Benedetto ; besides — — ” “ Besides what ? ” asked the Count .
“ Alas , do you not know ? ” “ What new <unk> ? ” “ My daughter — — ” “ Mademoiselle Danglars ? ” “ Eugénie has left us ! ” “ Good heavens , what are you telling me ? ” “ The truth , my dear count .
Oh , how happy you must be in not having either wife or children ! ” “ Do you think so ? ” “ Indeed I do . ” “ And so Mademoiselle Danglars — — ” “ She could not endure the insult offered to us by that wretch , so she asked permission to travel . ” “ And is she gone ? ” “ The other night she left . ” “ With Madame Danglars ? ” “ No , with a relation .
But still , we have quite lost our dear Eugénie ; for I doubt whether her pride will ever allow her to return to France . ” “ Still , baron , ” said Monte Cristo , “ family <unk> , or indeed any other <unk> which would crush a man whose child was his only treasure , are <unk> to a <unk> .
<unk> may well say , and <unk> men will always support the opinion , that money <unk> many <unk> ; and if you admit the <unk> of this sovereign <unk> , you ought to be very easily <unk> — you , the king of <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> power . ” Danglars looked at him <unk> , as though to ascertain whether he spoke seriously .
“ Yes , ” he answered , “ if a fortune brings consolation , I ought to be <unk> ; I am rich . ” “ So rich , dear sir , that your fortune resembles the <unk> ; if you wished to <unk> them you could not , and if it were possible , you would not dare ! ” Danglars smiled at the <unk> <unk> of the count .
“ That <unk> me , ” he said , “ that when you entered I was on the point of <unk> five little bonds ; I have already signed two : will you allow me to do the same to the others ? ” “ Pray do so . ” There was a moment ’ s silence , during which the noise of the banker ’ s pen was alone heard , while Monte Cristo examined the <unk> <unk> on the ceiling .
“ Are they Spanish , <unk> , or <unk> bonds ? ” said Monte Cristo .
“ No , ” said Danglars , smiling , “ they are bonds on the bank of France , <unk> to <unk> .
Stay , count , ” he added , “ you , who may be called the emperor , if I claim the title of king of <unk> , have you many pieces of paper of this size , each worth a million ? ” The count took into his hands the papers , which Danglars had so <unk> presented to him , and read : — “ ‘ To the <unk> of the <unk> .
<unk> pay to my order , from the <unk> deposited by me , the sum of a million , and charge the same to my account .
“ Baron Danglars . ’ ” “ One , two , three , four , five , ” said Monte Cristo ; “ five millions — why what a <unk> you are ! ” “ This is how I <unk> business , ” said Danglars .
“ It is really wonderful , ” said the count ; “ above all , if , as I suppose , it is <unk> at sight . ” “ It is , indeed , ” said Danglars .
“ It is a fine thing to have such credit ; really , it is only in France these things are done .
Five millions on five little <unk> of paper ! — it must be seen to be believed . ” “ You do not doubt it ? ” “ No ! ” “ You say so with an accent — stay , you shall be convinced ; take my clerk to the bank , and you will see him leave it with an order on the <unk> for the same sum . ” “ No , ” said Monte Cristo <unk> the five notes , “ most decidedly not ; the thing is so curious , I will make the <unk> myself .
I am <unk> on you for six millions .
I have drawn nine hundred thousand francs , you therefore still owe me five millions and a hundred thousand francs .
I will take the five <unk> of paper that I now hold as bonds , with your signature alone , and here is a receipt in full for the six millions between us .
I had prepared it beforehand , for I am much in want of money today . ” And Monte Cristo placed the bonds in his pocket with one hand , while with the other he held out the receipt to Danglars .
If a <unk> had fallen at the banker ’ s feet , he could not have experienced greater terror .
“ What , ” he stammered , “ do you mean to keep that money ?
Excuse me , excuse me , but I owe this money to the charity <unk> , — a <unk> which I promised to pay this morning . ” “ Oh , well , then , ” said Monte Cristo , “ I am not particular about these five notes , pay me in a different form ; I wished , from curiosity , to take these , that I might be able to say that without any advice or preparation the house of Danglars had paid me five millions without a minute ’ s delay ; it would have been remarkable .
But here are your bonds ; pay me differently ; ” and he held the bonds towards Danglars , who seized them like a <unk> extending its <unk> to <unk> the food that is being <unk> from its grasp .
Suddenly he <unk> , made a violent effort to restrain himself , and then a smile gradually <unk> the features of his disturbed countenance .
<unk> “ Certainly , ” he said , “ your receipt is money . ” “ Oh dear , yes ; and if you were at Rome , the house of Thomson &amp; French would make no more difficulty about paying the money on my receipt than you have just done . ” “ Pardon me , count , pardon me . ” “ Then I may keep this money ? ” “ Yes , ” said Danglars , while the perspiration started from the <unk> of his hair .
“ Yes , keep it — keep it . ” Monte Cristo replaced the notes in his pocket with that indescribable expression which seemed to say , “ Come , reflect ; if you <unk> there is still time . ” “ No , ” said Danglars , “ no , decidedly no ; keep my <unk> .
But you know none are so formal as <unk> in <unk> business ; I intended this money for the charity <unk> , and I seemed to be <unk> them if I did not pay them with these precise bonds .
How absurd — as if one crown were not as good as another .
Excuse me ; ” and he began to laugh loudly , but <unk> .
“ Certainly , I excuse you , ” said Monte Cristo <unk> , “ and pocket them . ” And he placed the bonds in his pocket-book .
“ But , ” said Danglars , “ there is still a sum of one hundred thousand francs ? ” “ Oh , a mere nothing , ” said Monte Cristo .
“ The balance would come to about that sum ; but keep it , and we shall be <unk> . ” “ Count , ” said Danglars , “ are you speaking seriously ? ” “ I never joke with <unk> , ” said Monte Cristo in a <unk> manner , which <unk> <unk> ; and he turned to the door , just as the valet de chambre announced : “ M.
de Boville , <unk> of the <unk> . ” “ _ Ma foi _ , ” said Monte Cristo ; “ I think I arrived just in time to obtain your <unk> , or they would have been <unk> with me . ” Danglars again became pale , and hastened to conduct the count out .
Monte Cristo exchanged a <unk> bow with M. de Boville , who was standing in the <unk> , and who was introduced into Danglars ’ room as soon as the count had left .
The count ’ s serious face was <unk> by a faint smile , as he noticed the <unk> which the <unk> held in his hand .
At the door he found his carriage , and was immediately driven to the bank .
Meanwhile Danglars , <unk> all emotion , advanced to meet the <unk> .
We need not say that a smile of <unk> was stamped upon his lips .
“ <unk> , <unk> , ” said he ; “ for I <unk> anything it is the <unk> who visits me . ” “ You are right , baron , ” answered M. de Boville ; “ the <unk> present themselves to you through me ; the <unk> and <unk> <unk> me to receive <unk> to the amount of five millions from you . ” “ And yet they say <unk> are to be <unk> , ” said Danglars , wishing to <unk> the jest .
“ Poor things ! ” “ Here I am in their name , ” said M. de Boville ; “ but did you receive my letter yesterday ? ” “ Yes . ” “ I have brought my receipt . ” <unk> “ My dear M. de Boville , your <unk> and <unk> must oblige me by waiting <unk> hours , since M. de Monte Cristo whom you just saw leaving here — you did see him , I think ? ” “ Yes ; well ? ” “ Well , M. de Monte Cristo has just carried off their five millions . ” “ How so ? ” “ The count has an <unk> credit upon me ; a credit opened by Thomson &amp; French , of Rome ; he came to demand five millions at once , which I paid him with <unk> on the bank .
My <unk> are deposited there , and you can understand that if I draw out ten millions on the same day it will appear rather strange to the governor .
Two days will be a different thing , ” said Danglars , smiling .
“ Come , ” said Boville , with a tone of entire <unk> , “ five millions to that gentleman who just left , and who bowed to me as though he knew me ? ” “ Perhaps he knows you , though you do not know him ; M. de Monte Cristo knows everybody . ” “ Five millions ! ” “ Here is his receipt .
Believe your own eyes . ” M. de Boville took the paper Danglars presented him , and read : “ <unk> of Baron Danglars the sum of five million one hundred thousand francs , to be <unk> on demand by the house of Thomson &amp; French of Rome . ” “ It is really true , ” said M. de Boville .
“ Do you know the house of Thomson &amp; French ? ” “ Yes , I once had business to <unk> with it to the amount of <unk> francs ; but since then I have not heard it mentioned . ” “ It is one of the best houses in Europe , ” said Danglars , <unk> throwing down the receipt on his desk .
“ And he had five millions in your hands alone !
Why , this Count of Monte Cristo must be a <unk> ? ” “ Indeed I do not know what he is ; he has three <unk> <unk> — one on me , one on <unk> , one on <unk> ; and , you see , ” he added <unk> , “ he has given me the preference , by leaving a balance of <unk> francs . ” M. de Boville manifested signs of extraordinary admiration .
“ I must visit him , ” he said , “ and obtain some <unk> grant from him . ” “ Oh , you may make sure of him ; his <unk> alone amount to <unk> francs a month . ” “ It is magnificent !
I will set before him the example of Madame de Morcerf and her son . ” “ What example ? ” “ They gave all their fortune to the <unk> . ” “ What fortune ? ” “ Their own — M.
de Morcerf ’ s , who is <unk> . ” “ For what reason ? ” “ Because they would not spend money so <unk> acquired . ” “ And what are they to live upon ? ” “ The mother <unk> into the country , and the son enters the army . ” <unk> “ Well , I must confess , these are scruples . ” “ I <unk> their deed of gift yesterday . ” “ And how much did they possess ? ” “ Oh , not much — from twelve to <unk> hundred thousand francs .
But to return to our millions . ” “ Certainly , ” said Danglars , in the most natural tone in the world .
“ Are you then pressed for this money ? ” “ Yes ; for the examination of our <unk> takes place tomorrow . ” “ <unk> ?
Why did you not tell me so before ?
Why , it is as good as a century !
At what hour does the examination take place ? ” “ At two o ’ clock . ” “ <unk> at twelve , ” said Danglars , smiling .
M. de Boville said nothing , but nodded his head , and took up the <unk> .
“ Now I think of it , you can do better , ” said Danglars .
“ How do you mean ? ” “ The receipt of M. de Monte Cristo is as good as money ; take it to <unk> ’ s or <unk> ’ s , and they will take it off your hands at once . ” “ What , though <unk> at Rome ? ” “ Certainly ; it will only cost you a <unk> of <unk> or <unk> francs . ” The <unk> started back .
“ _ Ma foi ! _ ” he said , “ I prefer waiting till tomorrow .
What a <unk> ! ” “ I thought , perhaps , ” said Danglars with supreme <unk> , “ that you had a <unk> to make up ? ” “ Indeed , ” said the <unk> .
“ And if that were the case it would be worth while to make some sacrifice . ” “ Thank you , no , sir . ” “ Then it will be tomorrow . ” “ Yes ; but without fail . ” “ Ah , you are laughing at me ; send tomorrow at twelve , and the bank shall be <unk> . ” “ I will come myself . ” “ <unk> still , since it will afford me the pleasure of seeing you . ” They shook hands .
“ By the way , ” said M. de Boville , “ are you not going to the funeral of poor Mademoiselle de Villefort , which I met on my road here ? ” “ No , ” said the banker ; “ I have appeared rather ridiculous since that affair of Benedetto , so I remain in the background . ” “ Bah , you are wrong .
How were you to blame in that affair ? ” “ Listen — when one bears an <unk> name , as I do , one is rather <unk> . ” “ <unk> <unk> you , sir ; and , above all , Mademoiselle Danglars ! ” “ Poor Eugénie ! ” said Danglars ; “ do you know she is going to embrace a religious life ? ” “ No . ” “ Alas , it is <unk> but too true .
The day after the event , she decided on leaving Paris with a nun of her acquaintance ; they are gone to seek a very strict convent in Italy or Spain . ” “ Oh , it is terrible ! ” and M. de Boville retired with this exclamation , after expressing <unk> sympathy with the father .
But he had scarcely left before Danglars , with an energy of action those can alone understand who have seen Robert <unk> represented by <unk> , <unk> exclaimed : “ <unk> ! ” Then <unk> Monte Cristo ’ s receipt in a little pocket-book , he added : — “ Yes , come at twelve o ’ clock ; I shall then be far away . ” Then he <unk> his door , <unk> all his <unk> , collected about fifty thousand francs in bank-notes , burned several papers , left others exposed to view , and then <unk> writing a letter which he addressed : “ To Madame la <unk> Danglars . ” “ I will place it on her table myself tonight , ” he murmured .
Then taking a passport from his drawer he said , — “ Good , it is available for two months longer . ” Chapter <unk> .
The <unk> of <unk> M. de Boville had indeed met the funeral procession which was taking Valentine to her last home on earth .
The weather was dull and stormy , a cold wind shook the few remaining yellow leaves from the <unk> of the trees , and scattered them among the crowd which filled the <unk> .
M. de Villefort , a true Parisian , considered the cemetery of <unk> alone worthy of receiving the mortal remains of a Parisian family ; there alone the corpses belonging to him would be surrounded by worthy <unk> .
He had therefore purchased a vault , which was quickly occupied by members of his family .
On the front of the <unk> was <unk> : “ The families of Saint-Méran and Villefort , ” for such had been the last wish expressed by poor Renée , Valentine ’ s mother .
The <unk> procession therefore <unk> its way towards <unk> from the Faubourg <unk> .
Having crossed Paris , it passed through the Faubourg du Temple , then leaving the <unk> <unk> , it reached the cemetery .
More than fifty private carriages followed the twenty <unk> , and behind them more than five hundred persons joined in the procession on foot .
<unk> These last consisted of all the young people whom Valentine ’ s death had struck like a <unk> , and who , notwithstanding the <unk> <unk> of the season , could not refrain from paying a last <unk> to the memory of the beautiful , <unk> , and <unk> girl , thus cut off in the flower of her youth .
As they left Paris , an <unk> with four horses , at full speed , was seen to draw up suddenly ; it contained Monte Cristo .
The count left the carriage and mingled in the crowd who followed on foot .
Château-Renaud perceived him and immediately <unk> from his _ <unk> _ , joined him ; Beauchamp did the same .
The count looked attentively through every opening in the crowd ; he was evidently watching for someone , but his search ended in disappointment .
<unk> “ Where is Morrel ? ” he asked ; “ do either of these gentlemen know where he is ? ” “ We have already asked that question , ” said Château-Renaud , “ for none of us has seen him . ” The count was silent , but continued to gaze around him .
At length they arrived at the cemetery .
The piercing eye of Monte Cristo glanced through <unk> of <unk> and trees , and was soon relieved from all anxiety , for seeing a shadow <unk> between the <unk> , Monte Cristo recognized him whom he sought .
One funeral is generally very much like another in this magnificent <unk> .
<unk> figures are seen scattered over the long white <unk> ; the silence of earth and heaven is alone broken by the noise made by the <unk> branches of <unk> planted around the <unk> ; then follows the melancholy <unk> of the priests , mingled now and then with a sob of anguish , <unk> from some woman concealed behind a mass of flowers .
The shadow Monte Cristo had noticed passed rapidly behind the tomb of <unk> and <unk> , placed itself close to the heads of the horses belonging to the hearse , and following the <unk> ’ s men , arrived with them at the spot appointed for the <unk> .
Each person ’ s attention was occupied .
Monte Cristo saw nothing but the shadow , which no one else observed .
<unk> the count left the ranks to see whether the object of his interest had any concealed weapon beneath his clothes .
When the procession stopped , this shadow was recognized as Morrel , who , with his coat <unk> up to his throat , his face livid , and convulsively crushing his hat between his fingers , leaned against a tree , situated on an <unk> <unk> the <unk> , so that none of the funeral details could escape his observation .
Everything was conducted in the usual manner .
A few men , the least impressed of all by the scene , pronounced a <unk> , some <unk> this <unk> death , others <unk> on the grief of the father , and one very ingenious person <unk> the fact that Valentine had <unk> pardon of her father for <unk> on whom the arm of justice was ready to fall — until at length they exhausted their <unk> of <unk> and mournful <unk> , <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
Monte Cristo heard and saw nothing , or rather he only saw Morrel , whose calmness had a frightful effect on those who knew what was passing in his heart .
“ See , ” said Beauchamp , pointing out Morrel to Debray .
“ What is he doing up there ? ” And they called Château-Renaud ’ s attention to him .
“ How pale he is ! ” said Château-Renaud , shuddering .
“ He is cold , ” said Debray .
“ Not at all , ” said Château-Renaud , slowly ; “ I think he is violently agitated .
He is very <unk> . ” “ Bah , ” said Debray ; “ he scarcely knew Mademoiselle de Villefort ; you said so yourself . ” “ True .
Still I remember he danced three times with her at Madame de Morcerf ’ s .
Do you recollect that ball , count , where you produced such an effect ? ” <unk> “ No , I do not , ” replied Monte Cristo , without even knowing of what or to whom he was speaking , so much was he occupied in watching Morrel , who was holding his breath with emotion .
“ The <unk> is over ; farewell , gentlemen , ” said the count , <unk> .
And he disappeared without anyone seeing whither he went .
The funeral being over , the guests returned to Paris .
Château-Renaud looked for a moment for Morrel ; but while they were watching the departure of the count , Morrel had quitted his post , and Château-Renaud , <unk> in his search , joined Debray and Beauchamp .
Monte Cristo concealed himself behind a large tomb and awaited the arrival of Morrel , who by degrees approached the tomb now abandoned by spectators and <unk> .
Morrel threw a glance around , but before it reached the spot occupied by Monte Cristo the latter had advanced yet nearer , still <unk> .
The young man knelt down .
The count , with <unk> neck and <unk> eyes , stood in an attitude ready to <unk> upon Morrel upon the first occasion .
Morrel bent his head till it touched the stone , then <unk> the grating with both hands , he murmured : “ Oh , Valentine ! ” The count ’ s heart was pierced by the utterance of these two words ; he stepped forward , and touching the young man ’ s shoulder , said : “ I was looking for you , my friend . ” Monte Cristo expected a burst of passion , but he was deceived , for Morrel turning round , said calmly , — “ You see I was praying . ” The <unk> glance of the count searched the young man from head to foot .
He then seemed more easy .
“ Shall I drive you back to Paris ? ” he asked .
“ No , thank you . ” “ Do you wish anything ? ” “ Leave me to pray . ” The count withdrew without opposition , but it was only to place himself in a situation where he could watch every movement of Morrel , who at length arose , <unk> the dust from his knees , and turned towards Paris , without once looking back .
He walked slowly down the Rue de la <unk> .
The count , <unk> his carriage , followed him about a hundred paces behind .
Maximilian crossed the <unk> and entered the Rue <unk> by the <unk> .
Five minutes after the door had been closed on Morrel ’ s entrance , it was again opened for the count .
Julie was at the entrance of the garden , where she was attentively watching Penelon , who , entering with <unk> into his profession of gardener , was very busy <unk> some <unk> roses .
“ Ah , count , ” she exclaimed , with the delight manifested by every member of the family whenever he visited the Rue <unk> .
“ Maximilian has just returned , has he not , madame ? ” asked the count .
<unk> “ Yes , I think I saw him pass ; but pray , call Emmanuel . ” “ Excuse me , madame , but I must go up to Maximilian ’ s room this instant , ” replied Monte Cristo , “ I have something of the greatest importance to tell him . ” “ Go , then , ” she said with a charming smile , which accompanied him until he had disappeared .
Monte Cristo soon ran up the staircase <unk> from the ground floor to Maximilian ’ s room ; when he reached the landing he listened attentively , but all was still .
Like many old houses occupied by a single family , the room door was <unk> with glass ; but it was locked , Maximilian was shut in , and it was impossible to see what was passing in the room , because a red curtain was drawn before the glass .
The count ’ s anxiety was manifested by a bright color which seldom appeared on the face of that <unk> man .
“ What shall I do ! ” he uttered , and reflected for a moment ; “ shall I ring ?
No , the sound of a bell , <unk> a visitor , will but <unk> the resolution of one in Maximilian ’ s situation , and then the bell would be followed by a <unk> noise . ” Monte Cristo trembled from head to foot and as if his determination had been taken with the rapidity of lightning , he struck one of the <unk> of glass with his elbow ; the glass was <unk> to <unk> , then <unk> the curtain he saw Morrel , who had been writing at his desk , bound from his seat at the noise of the broken window .
“ I beg a thousand <unk> , ” said the count , “ there is nothing the matter , but I slipped down and broke one of your <unk> of glass with my elbow .
Since it is opened , I will take advantage of it to enter your room ; do not disturb yourself — do not disturb yourself ! ” And passing his hand through the broken glass , the count opened the door .
Morrel , evidently <unk> , came to meet Monte Cristo less with the intention of receiving him than to <unk> his entry .
“ _ Ma foi _ , ” said Monte Cristo , <unk> his elbow , “ it ’ s all your servant ’ s fault ; your stairs are so polished , it is like walking on glass . ” “ Are you hurt , sir ? ” coldly asked Morrel .
“ I believe not .
But what are you about there ?
You were writing . ” “ I ? ” “ Your fingers are <unk> with ink . ” “ Ah , true , I was writing .
I do sometimes , soldier though I am . ” Monte Cristo advanced into the room ; Maximilian was obliged to let him pass , but he followed him .
“ You were writing ? ” said Monte Cristo with a searching look .
“ I have already had the honor of telling you I was , ” said Morrel .
The count looked around him .
“ Your pistols are beside your desk , ” said Monte Cristo , pointing with his finger to the pistols on the table .
“ I am on the point of starting on a journey , ” replied Morrel <unk> .
“ My friend , ” exclaimed Monte Cristo in a tone of exquisite sweetness .
“ Sir ? ” “ My friend , my dear Maximilian , do not make a hasty resolution , I entreat you . ” “ I make a hasty resolution ? ” said Morrel , <unk> his shoulders ; “ is there anything extraordinary in a journey ? ” <unk> “ Maximilian , ” said the count , “ let us both lay aside the mask we have assumed .
You no more deceive me with that false calmness than I <unk> upon you with my <unk> solicitude .
You can understand , can you not , that to have acted as I have done , to have broken that glass , to have <unk> on the solitude of a friend — you can understand that , to have done all this , I must have been <unk> by real uneasiness , or rather by a terrible conviction .
Morrel , you are going to destroy yourself ! ” “ Indeed , count , ” said Morrel , shuddering ; “ what has put this into your head ? ” “ I tell you that you are about to destroy yourself , ” continued the count , “ and here is proof of what I say ; ” and , approaching the desk , he removed the sheet of paper which Morrel had placed over the letter he had begun , and took the latter in his hands .
Morrel rushed forward to tear it from him , but Monte Cristo perceiving his intention , seized his <unk> with his iron grasp .
“ You wish to destroy yourself , ” said the count ; “ you have written it . ” “ Well , ” said Morrel , changing his expression of calmness for one of violence — “ well , and if I do intend to turn this pistol against myself , who shall prevent me — who will dare prevent me ?
All my hopes are <unk> , my heart is broken , my life a burden , everything around me is sad and mournful ; earth has become <unk> to me , and human voices <unk> me .
It is a mercy to let me die , for if I live I shall lose my reason and become mad .
When , sir , I tell you all this with tears of <unk> anguish , can you reply that I am wrong , can you prevent my putting an end to my miserable existence ?
Tell me , sir , could you have the courage to do so ? ” “ Yes , Morrel , ” said Monte Cristo , with a calmness which <unk> strangely with the young man ’ s excitement ; “ yes , I would do so . ” “ You ? ” exclaimed Morrel , with increasing anger and reproach — “ you , who have deceived me with false hopes , who have <unk> and <unk> me with vain promises , when I might , if not have saved her , at least have seen her die in my arms !
You , who pretend to understand everything , even the hidden <unk> of knowledge , — and who <unk> the part of a <unk> angel upon earth , and could not even find an <unk> to a poison <unk> to a young girl !
Ah , sir , indeed you would inspire me with pity , were you not <unk> in my eyes . ” “ Morrel — — ” “ Yes ; you tell me to lay aside the mask , and I will do so , be satisfied !
When you spoke to me at the cemetery , I answered you — my heart was softened ; when you arrived here , I allowed you to enter .
But since you <unk> my confidence , since you have <unk> a new torture after I thought I had exhausted them all , then , Count of Monte Cristo my pretended benefactor — then , Count of Monte Cristo , the universal <unk> , be satisfied , you shall witness the death of your friend ; ” and Morrel , with a <unk> laugh , again rushed towards the pistols .
“ And I again repeat , you shall not commit suicide . ” “ <unk> me , then ! ” replied Morrel , with another struggle , which , like the first , failed in <unk> him from the count ’ s iron grasp .
“ I will prevent you . ” <unk> “ And who are you , then , that <unk> to yourself this <unk> right over free and rational beings ? ” “ Who am I ? ” repeated Monte Cristo .
“ Listen ; I am the only man in the world having the right to say to you , ‘ Morrel , your father ’ s son shall not die today ; ’ ” and Monte Cristo , with an expression of majesty and <unk> , advanced with arms folded toward the young man , who , <unk> overcome by the <unk> manner of this man , recoiled a step .
“ Why do you mention my father ? ” stammered he ; “ why do you <unk> a recollection of him with the affairs of today ? ” “ Because I am he who saved your father ’ s life when he wished to destroy himself , as you do today — because I am the man who sent the purse to your young sister , and the _ Pharaon _ to old Morrel — because I am the Edmond Dantès who <unk> you , a child , on my knees . ” Morrel made another step back , <unk> , breathless , crushed ; then all his strength give way , and he fell <unk> at the feet of Monte Cristo .
Then his admirable nature <unk> a complete and sudden <unk> ; he arose , rushed out of the room and to the stairs , <unk> <unk> , “ Julie , Julie — Emmanuel , Emmanuel ! ” Monte Cristo endeavored also to leave , but Maximilian would have died rather than <unk> his hold of the handle of the door , which he closed upon the count .
Julie , Emmanuel , and some of the servants , ran up in alarm on hearing the cries of Maximilian .
Morrel seized their hands , and opening the door exclaimed in a voice <unk> with sobs : “ On your knees — on your knees — he is our benefactor — the <unk> of our father !
He is — — ” He would have added “ Edmond Dantès , ” but the count seized his arm and prevented him .
Julie threw herself into the arms of the count ; Emmanuel embraced him as a <unk> angel ; Morrel again fell on his knees , and struck the ground with his forehead .
Then the <unk> man felt his heart <unk> in his breast ; a flame seemed to rush from his throat to his eyes , he bent his head and wept .
For a while nothing was heard in the room but a succession of sobs , while the <unk> from their grateful hearts mounted to heaven .
Julie had scarcely recovered from her deep emotion when she rushed out of the room , descended to the next floor , ran into the drawing-room with <unk> joy and raised the <unk> <unk> which covered the purse given by the unknown of the <unk> de <unk> .
Meanwhile , Emmanuel in a broken voice said to the count : “ Oh , count , how could you , hearing us so often speak of our unknown benefactor , seeing us pay such <unk> of gratitude and <unk> to his memory , — how could you continue so long without <unk> yourself to us ?
Oh , it was cruel to us , and — dare I say it ? — to you also . ” “ Listen , my friends , ” said the count — “ I may call you so since we have really been friends for the last eleven years — the discovery of this secret has been <unk> by a great event which you must never know .
I wished to <unk> it during my whole life in my own bosom , but your brother Maximilian <unk> it from me by a violence he <unk> of now , I am sure . ” Then turning around , and seeing that Morrel , still on his knees , had thrown himself into an armchair , he added in a low voice , pressing Emmanuel ’ s hand <unk> , “ <unk> over him . ” “ Why so ? ” asked the young man , surprised .
“ I cannot explain myself ; but watch over him . ” Emmanuel looked around the room and caught sight of the pistols ; his eyes rested on the weapons , and he pointed to them .
Monte Cristo bent his head .
Emmanuel went towards the pistols .
“ Leave them , ” said Monte Cristo .
Then walking towards Morrel , he took his hand ; the <unk> agitation of the young man was succeeded by a profound <unk> .
Julie returned , holding the <unk> purse in her hands , while tears of joy rolled down her cheeks , like <unk> on the rose .
“ Here is the <unk> , ” she said ; “ do not think it will be less dear to us now we are acquainted with our benefactor ! ” “ My child , ” said Monte Cristo , <unk> , “ allow me to take back that purse ?
Since you now know my face , I wish to be remembered alone through the affection I hope you will grant me .
“ Oh , ” said Julie , pressing the purse to her heart , “ no , no , I <unk> you do not take it , for some unhappy day you will leave us , will you not ? ” “ You have guessed rightly , madame , ” replied Monte Cristo , smiling ; “ in a week I shall have left this country , where so many persons who merit the vengeance of Heaven lived happily , while my father <unk> of hunger and grief . ” While <unk> his departure , the count fixed his eyes on Morrel , and remarked that the words , “ I shall have left this country , ” had failed to <unk> him from his <unk> .
He then saw that he must make another struggle against the grief of his friend , and taking the hands of Emmanuel and Julie , which he pressed within his own , he said with the <unk> authority of a father : “ My kind friends , leave me alone with Maximilian . ” Julie saw the means offered of carrying off her precious <unk> , which Monte Cristo had forgotten .
She drew her husband to the door .
“ Let us leave them , ” she said .
The count was alone with Morrel , who remained motionless as a statue .
“ Come , ” said <unk> , touching his shoulder with his finger , “ are you a man again , Maximilian ? ” “ Yes ; for I begin to suffer again . ” The count <unk> , apparently in gloomy hesitation .
“ Maximilian , Maximilian , ” he said , “ the ideas you yield to are unworthy of a Christian . ” “ Oh , do not fear , my friend , ” said Morrel , raising his head , and smiling with a sweet expression on the count ; “ I shall no longer attempt my life . ” “ Then we are to have no more pistols — no more despair ? ” “ No ; I have found a better remedy for my grief than either a bullet or a knife . ” “ Poor fellow , what is it ? ” “ My grief will kill me of itself . ” “ My friend , ” said Monte Cristo , with an expression of melancholy equal to his own , “ listen to me .
One day , in a moment of despair like yours , since it led to a similar resolution , I also wished to kill myself ; one day your father , equally desperate , wished to kill himself too .
If anyone had said to your father , at the moment he raised the pistol to his head — if anyone had told me , when in my prison I pushed back the food I had not <unk> for three days — if anyone had said to either of us then , ‘ <unk> — the day will come when you will be happy , and will bless life ! ’ — no matter whose voice had spoken , we should have heard him with the smile of doubt , or the anguish of <unk> , — and yet how many times has your father blessed life while <unk> you — how often have I myself — — ” “ Ah , ” exclaimed Morrel , <unk> the count , “ you had only lost your liberty , my father had only lost his fortune , but I have lost Valentine . ” “ Look at me , ” said Monte Cristo , with that expression which sometimes made him so <unk> and <unk> — “ look at me .
There are no tears in my eyes , nor is there fever in my veins , yet I see you suffer — you , Maximilian , whom I love as my own son .
Well , does not this tell you that in grief , as in life , there is always something to look forward to beyond ?
Now , if I entreat , if I order you to live , Morrel , it is in the conviction that one day you will thank me for having preserved your life . ” “ Oh , heavens , ” said the young man , “ oh , heavens — what are you saying , count ?
Take care .
But perhaps you have never loved ! ” “ <unk> ! ” replied the count .
“ I mean , as I love .
You see , I have been a soldier ever since I attained <unk> .
I reached the age of <unk> without loving , for none of the feelings I before then experienced merit the <unk> of love .
Well , at <unk> I saw Valentine ; for two years I have loved her , for two years I have seen written in her heart , as in a book , all the virtues of a daughter and wife .
Count , to possess Valentine would have been a happiness too infinite , too <unk> , too complete , too divine for this world , since it has been denied me ; but without Valentine the earth is <unk> . ” “ I have told you to hope , ” said the count .
“ Then have a care , I repeat , for you seek to persuade me , and if you succeed I should lose my reason , for I should hope that I could again behold Valentine . ” The count smiled .
“ My friend , my father , ” said Morrel with excitement , “ have a care , I again repeat , for the power you <unk> over me <unk> me .
<unk> your words before you speak , for my eyes have already become <unk> , and my heart <unk> strongly ; be <unk> , or you will make me believe in <unk> <unk> .
I must obey you , though you bade me call forth the dead or walk upon the water . ” “ <unk> , my friend , ” repeated the count .
“ Ah , ” said Morrel , falling from the height of excitement to the abyss of despair — “ <unk> , you are playing with me , like those good , or rather selfish mothers who <unk> their children with <unk> words , because their <unk> <unk> them .
No , my friend , I was wrong to caution you ; do not fear , I will <unk> my grief so deep in my heart , I will disguise it so , that you shall not even care to <unk> with me .
Adieu , my friend , adieu ! ” “ On the contrary , ” said the count , “ after this time you must live with me — you must not leave me , and in a week we shall have left France behind us . ” “ And you still <unk> me hope ? ” “ I tell you to hope , because I have a method of <unk> you . ” “ Count , you render me <unk> than before , if it be possible .
You think the result of this blow has been to produce an ordinary grief , and you would cure it by an ordinary remedy — change of scene . ” And Morrel dropped his head with <unk> <unk> .
“ What can I say more ? ” asked Monte Cristo .
“ I have confidence in the remedy I propose , and only ask you to permit me to assure you of its <unk> . ” “ Count , you <unk> my agony . ” “ Then , ” said the count , “ your feeble spirit will not even grant me the trial I request ?
Come — do you know of what the Count of Monte Cristo is capable ?
do you know that he holds <unk> beings under his <unk> ?
nay , that he can almost work a miracle ?
Well , wait for the miracle I hope to accomplish , or — — ” “ Or ? ” repeated Morrel .
“ Or , take care , Morrel , lest I call you <unk> . ” “ Have pity on me , count ! ” “ I feel so much pity towards you , Maximilian , that — listen to me attentively — if I do not cure you in a month , to the day , to the very hour , mark my words , Morrel , I will place loaded pistols before you , and a cup of the <unk> Italian poison — a poison more sure and <unk> than that which has killed Valentine . ” “ Will you promise me ? ” “ Yes ; for I am a man , and have suffered like yourself , and also contemplated suicide ; indeed , often since misfortune has left me I have longed for the <unk> of an eternal sleep . ” “ But you are sure you will promise me this ? ” said Morrel , intoxicated .
“ I not only promise , but swear it ! ” said Monte Cristo extending his hand .
“ In a month , then , on your honor , if I am not <unk> , you will let me take my life into my own hands , and whatever may happen you will not call me <unk> ? ” “ In a month , to the day , the very hour and the date is a sacred one , Maximilian .
I do not know whether you remember that this is the 5th of September ; it is ten years today since I saved your father ’ s life , who wished to die . ” Morrel seized the count ’ s hand and kissed it ; the count allowed him to pay the <unk> he felt due to him .
“ In a month you will find on the table , at which we shall be then sitting , good pistols and a <unk> draught ; but , on the other hand , you must promise me not to attempt your life before that time . ” “ Oh , I also swear it ! ” Monte Cristo drew the young man towards him , and pressed him for some time to his heart .
“ And now , ” he said , “ after today , you will come and live with me ; you can occupy Haydée ’ s apartment , and my daughter will at least be replaced by my son . ” “ Haydée ? ” said Morrel , “ what has become of her ? ” “ She departed last night . ” “ To leave you ? ” “ To wait for me .
Hold yourself ready then to join me at the Champs-Élysées , and lead me out of this house without anyone seeing my departure . ” Maximilian hung his head , and obeyed with <unk> <unk> .
Chapter <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> The apartment on the first floor of the house in the Rue <unk> , where Albert de Morcerf had selected a home for his mother , was let to a very mysterious person .
This was a man whose face the concierge himself had never seen , for in the winter his chin was buried in one of the large red <unk> worn by gentlemen ’ s <unk> on a cold night , and in the summer he made a point of always blowing his nose just as he approached the door .
<unk> to custom , this gentleman had not been watched , for as the report ran that he was a person of high rank , and one who would allow no <unk> interference , his _ <unk> _ was <unk> respected .
His visits were tolerably regular , though occasionally he appeared a little before or after his time , but generally , both in summer and winter , he took possession of his apartment about four o ’ clock , though he never spent the night there .
At half-past three in the winter the fire was lighted by the <unk> servant , who had the <unk> of the little apartment , and in the summer <unk> were placed on the table at the same hour .
At four o ’ clock , as we have already stated , the mysterious personage arrived .
<unk> minutes afterwards a carriage stopped at the house , a lady <unk> in a black or dark blue dress , and always <unk> veiled ; she passed like a shadow through the lodge , and ran upstairs without a sound <unk> under the touch of her light foot .
No one ever asked her where she was going .
Her face , therefore , like that of the gentleman , was perfectly unknown to the two <unk> , who were perhaps <unk> throughout the capital for <unk> .
We need not say she stopped at the first floor .
Then she <unk> in a peculiar manner at a door , which after being opened to admit her was again fastened , and curiosity penetrated no farther .
They used the same precautions in leaving as in entering the house .
The lady always left first , and as soon as she had stepped into her carriage , it drove away , sometimes towards the right hand , sometimes to the left ; then about twenty minutes afterwards the gentleman would also leave , buried in his cravat or concealed by his handkerchief .
The day after Monte Cristo had called upon Danglars , the mysterious <unk> entered at ten o ’ clock in the morning instead of four in the afternoon .
<unk> directly afterwards , without the usual interval of time , a cab arrived , and the veiled lady ran hastily upstairs .
The door opened , but before it could be closed , the lady exclaimed : “ Oh , Lucien — oh , my friend ! ” The concierge therefore heard for the first time that the <unk> ’ s name was Lucien ; still , as he was the very perfection of a <unk> , he made up his mind not to tell his wife .
“ Well , what is the matter , my dear ? ” asked the gentleman whose name the lady ’ s agitation revealed ; “ tell me what is the matter . ” “ Oh , Lucien , can I <unk> in you ? ” “ Of course , you know you can do so .
But what can be the matter ?
Your note of this morning has completely bewildered me .
This <unk> — this unusual <unk> .
Come , ease me of my anxiety , or else <unk> me at once . ” “ Lucien , a great event has happened ! ” said the lady , glancing <unk> at Lucien , — “ M.
Danglars left last night ! ” “ <unk> ? — M.
Danglars left ?
Where has he gone ? ” “ I do not know . ” “ What do you mean ?
Has he gone intending not to return ? ” “ <unk> ; — at ten o ’ clock at night his horses took him to the barrier of <unk> ; there a <unk> was waiting for him — he entered it with his valet de chambre , saying that he was going to <unk> . ” “ Then what did you mean — — ” “ Stay — he left a letter for me . ” “ A letter ? ” “ Yes ; read it . ” And the baroness took from her pocket a letter which she gave to Debray .
Debray paused a moment before reading , as if trying to guess its contents , or perhaps while making up his mind how to act , whatever it might contain .
No doubt his ideas were arranged in a few minutes , for he began reading the letter which caused so much uneasiness in the heart of the baroness , and which ran as follows : “ ‘ Madame and most faithful wife . ’ ” Debray mechanically stopped and looked at the baroness , whose face became covered with <unk> .
“ <unk> , ” she said .
Debray continued : “ ‘ When you receive this , you will no longer have a husband .
Oh , you need not be alarmed , you will only have lost him as you have lost your daughter ; I mean that I shall be travelling on one of the thirty or forty roads leading out of France .
I owe you some <unk> for my conduct , and as you are a woman that can perfectly understand me , I will give them .
Listen , then .
I received this morning five millions which I paid away ; almost directly afterwards another demand for the same sum was presented to me ; I put this <unk> off till tomorrow and I intend leaving today , to escape that tomorrow , which would be rather too unpleasant for me to endure .
You understand this , do you not , my most precious wife ?
I say you understand this , because you are as <unk> with my affairs as I am ; indeed , I think you understand them better , since I am ignorant of what has become of a considerable portion of my fortune , once very tolerable , while I am sure , madame , that you know perfectly well .
For women have <unk> <unk> ; they can even explain the marvellous by an <unk> <unk> they have invented ; but I , who only understand my own figures , know nothing more than that one day these figures deceived me .
Have you admired the rapidity of my fall ?
Have you been slightly dazzled at the sudden <unk> of my <unk> ?
I confess I have seen nothing but the fire ; let us hope you have found some gold among the ashes .
With this <unk> idea , I leave you , madame , and most prudent wife , without any <unk> reproach for <unk> you ; you have friends left , and the ashes I have already mentioned , and above all the liberty I hasten to restore to you .
And here , madame , I must add another word of explanation .
So long as I hoped you were working for the good of our house and for the fortune of our daughter , I <unk> closed my eyes ; but as you have <unk> that house into a vast ruin I will not be the foundation of another man ’ s fortune .
You were rich when I married you , but little respected .
Excuse me for speaking so very <unk> , but as this is intended only for ourselves , I do not see why I should <unk> my words .
I have augmented our fortune , and it has continued to increase during the last fifteen years , till extraordinary and unexpected <unk> have suddenly <unk> it , — without any fault of mine , I can <unk> declare .
You , madame , have only sought to increase your own , and I am convinced that you have succeeded .
I leave you , therefore , as I took you , — rich , but little respected .
Adieu !
I also intend from this time to work on my own account .
<unk> my <unk> for the example you have set me , and which I intend following .
“ ‘ Your very devoted husband , “ ‘ Baron Danglars . ’ ” The baroness had watched Debray while he read this long and painful letter , and saw him , notwithstanding his <unk> , change color once or twice .
When he had ended the <unk> , he folded the letter and resumed his <unk> attitude .
“ Well ? ” asked Madame Danglars , with an anxiety easy to be understood .
“ Well , madame ? ” <unk> repeated Debray .
“ With what ideas does that letter inspire you ? ” “ Oh , it is simple enough , madame ; it <unk> me with the idea that M. Danglars has left <unk> . ” “ Certainly ; but is this all you have to say to me ? ” “ I do not understand you , ” said Debray with <unk> <unk> .
“ He is gone !
<unk> , never to return ! ” “ Oh , madame , do not think that ! ” “ I tell you he will never return .
I know his character ; he is <unk> in any <unk> formed for his own interests .
If he could have made any use of me , he would have taken me with him ; he leaves me in Paris , as our separation will <unk> to his benefit ; — therefore he has gone , and I am free forever , ” added Madame Danglars , in the same <unk> tone .
Debray , instead of answering , allowed her to remain in an attitude of nervous inquiry .
“ Well ? ” she said at length , “ do you not answer me ? ” “ I have but one question to ask you , — what do you intend to do ? ” “ I was going to ask you , ” replied the baroness with a beating heart .
“ Ah , then , you wish to ask advice of me ? ” “ Yes ; I do wish to ask your advice , ” said Madame Danglars with anxious expectation .
“ Then if you wish to take my advice , ” said the young man coldly , “ I would recommend you to travel . ” “ To travel ! ” she murmured .
“ Certainly ; as M. Danglars says , you are rich , and perfectly free .
In my opinion , a <unk> from Paris is absolutely necessary after the double catastrophe of Mademoiselle Danglars ’ broken contract and M. Danglars ’ disappearance .
The world will think you abandoned and poor , for the wife of a <unk> would never be <unk> , were she to keep up an appearance of <unk> .
You have only to remain in Paris for about a fortnight , telling the world you are abandoned , and relating the details of this <unk> to your best friends , who will soon spread the report .
Then you can quit your house , leaving your jewels and giving up your <unk> , and everyone ’ s mouth will be filled with <unk> of your <unk> .
They will know you are deserted , and think you also poor , for I alone know your real <unk> position , and am quite ready to give up my accounts as an honest partner . ” The dread with which the pale and motionless baroness listened to this , was <unk> by the calm indifference with which Debray had spoken .
“ <unk> ? ” she repeated ; “ <unk> , yes , I am , indeed , deserted !
You are right , sir , and no one can doubt my position . ” These were the only words that this proud and violently <unk> woman could utter in <unk> to Debray .
<unk> “ But then you are rich , — very rich , indeed , ” continued Debray , taking out some papers from his pocket-book , which he spread upon the table .
Madame Danglars did not see them ; she was engaged in <unk> the <unk> of her heart , and <unk> the tears which were ready to <unk> forth .
At length a sense of dignity prevailed , and if she did not entirely master her agitation , she at least succeeded in <unk> the fall of a single tear .
“ Madame , ” said Debray , “ it is nearly six months since we have been associated .
You furnished a principal of <unk> francs .
Our <unk> began in the month of April .
In May we <unk> <unk> , and in the course of the month gained <unk> francs .
In June the profit <unk> to <unk> .
In July we added <unk> francs , — it was , you know , the month of the Spanish bonds .
In August we lost <unk> francs at the beginning of the month , but on the <unk> we made up for it , and we now find that our accounts , <unk> from the first day of <unk> up to yesterday , when I closed them , showed a capital of <unk> francs , that is , <unk> for each of us .
Now , madame , ” said Debray , <unk> up his accounts in the <unk> manner of a <unk> , “ there are still <unk> francs , the interest of this money , in my hands . ” “ But , ” said the baroness , “ I thought you never put the money out to interest . ” “ Excuse me , madame , ” said Debray coldly , “ I had your permission to do so , and I have made use of it .
There are , then , <unk> francs for your share , besides the <unk> you furnished me to begin with , making in all <unk> francs for your portion .
Now , madame , I took the precaution of drawing out your money the day before yesterday ; it is not long ago , you see , and I was in continual expectation of being called on to deliver up my accounts .
There is your money , — half in bank-notes , the other half in <unk> <unk> to <unk> .
I say _ there _ , for as I did not consider my house safe enough , or <unk> sufficiently <unk> , and as landed property <unk> evidence with it , and moreover since you have no right to possess anything independent of your husband , I have kept this sum , now your whole fortune , in a chest concealed under that <unk> , and for greater security I myself concealed it there .
“ Now , madame , ” continued Debray , first opening the <unk> , then the chest ; — “ now , madame , here are <unk> notes of <unk> francs each , resembling , as you see , a large book bound in iron ; to this I add a <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> francs ; then , for the odd <unk> , making I think about <unk> francs , here is a check upon my banker , who , not being M. Danglars , will pay you the amount , you may rest assured . ” Madame Danglars mechanically took the check , the <unk> , and the heap of bank-notes .
This enormous fortune made no great appearance on the table .
Madame Danglars , with <unk> eyes , but with her breast <unk> with concealed emotion , placed the bank-notes in her bag , put the <unk> and check into her pocket-book , and then , standing pale and mute , awaited one kind word of consolation .
But she waited in vain .
“ Now , madame , ” said Debray , “ you have a splendid fortune , an income of about <unk> livres a year , which is enormous for a woman who cannot keep an establishment here for a year , at least .
You will be able to indulge all your fancies ; besides , should you find your income <unk> , you can , for the sake of the past , madame , make use of mine ; and I am ready to offer you all I possess , on <unk> . ” “ Thank you , sir — thank you , ” replied the baroness ; “ you forget that what you have just paid me is much more than a poor woman requires , who <unk> for some time , at least , to retire from the world . ” Debray was , for a moment , surprised , but immediately <unk> himself , he bowed with an air which seemed to say , “ As you please , madame . ” Madame Danglars had until then , perhaps , hoped for something ; but when she saw the <unk> bow of Debray , and the glance by which it was accompanied , together with his significant silence , she raised her head , and without passion or violence or even hesitation , ran downstairs , <unk> to address a last farewell to one who could thus part from her .
“ Bah , ” said Debray , when she had left , “ these are fine projects !
She will remain at home , read <unk> , and <unk> at cards , since she can no longer do so on the <unk> . ” Then taking up his account book , he <unk> with the greatest care all the <unk> of the <unk> he had just paid away .
“ I have <unk> francs remaining , ” he said .
“ What a pity Mademoiselle de Villefort is dead !
She suited me in every respect , and I would have married her . ” And he calmly waited until the twenty minutes had elapsed after Madame Danglars ’ departure before he left the house .
During this time he occupied himself in making figures , with his watch by his side .
<unk> — that <unk> personage , who would have been created by every <unk> imagination if Le <unk> had not acquired the <unk> in his great <unk> — would have enjoyed a singular spectacle , if he had lifted up the roof of the little house in the Rue <unk> , while Debray was casting up his figures .
<unk> the room in which Debray had been <unk> two millions and a half with Madame Danglars was another , inhabited by persons who have played too <unk> a part in the <unk> we have related for their appearance not to create some interest .
Mercédès and Albert were in that room .
Mercédès was much changed within the last few days ; not that even in her days of fortune she had ever dressed with the magnificent display which makes us no longer able to recognize a woman when she appears in a plain and simple <unk> ; nor indeed , had she fallen into that state of <unk> where it is impossible to conceal the <unk> of misery ; no , the change in Mercédès was that her eye no longer <unk> , her lips no longer smiled , and there was now a hesitation in uttering the words which formerly sprang so <unk> from her ready wit .
It was not poverty which had broken her spirit ; it was not a want of courage which rendered her poverty <unk> .
Mercédès , although <unk> from the <unk> position she had occupied , lost in the <unk> she had now chosen , like a person passing from a room <unk> lighted into utter darkness , appeared like a <unk> , fallen from her palace to a hovel , and who , reduced to strict necessity , could neither become <unk> to the <unk> <unk> she was herself forced to place upon the table , nor to the humble <unk> which had become her bed .
The beautiful <unk> and noble countess had lost both her proud glance and charming smile , because she saw nothing but misery around her ; the walls were hung with one of the gray papers which <unk> <unk> choose as not likely to show the <unk> ; the floor was <unk> ; the furniture attracted the attention to the poor attempt at luxury ; indeed , everything offended eyes accustomed to <unk> and elegance .
Madame de Morcerf had lived there since leaving her house ; the continual silence of the spot <unk> her ; still , seeing that Albert continually watched her countenance to judge the state of her feelings , she <unk> herself to assume a <unk> smile of the lips alone , which , <unk> with the sweet and <unk> expression that usually shone from her eyes , seemed like “ moonlight on a statue , ” — <unk> light without warmth .
Albert , too , was ill at ease ; the remains of luxury prevented him from sinking into his actual position .
If he wished to go out without gloves , his hands appeared too white ; if he wished to walk through the town , his boots seemed too highly polished .
Yet these two noble and intelligent creatures , united by the <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> love , had succeeded in <unk> understanding one another , and <unk> their <unk> , and Albert had been able to tell his mother without <unk> a change of countenance : “ Mother , we have no more money . ” <unk> Mercédès had never known misery ; she had often , in her youth , spoken of poverty , but between want and necessity , those <unk> words , there is a wide difference .
<unk> the Catalans , Mercédès wished for a thousand things , but still she never really wanted any .
So long as the <unk> were good , they caught fish ; and so long as they sold their fish , they were able to buy <unk> for new <unk> .
And then , shut out from friendship , having but one affection , which could not be mixed up with her ordinary <unk> , she thought of herself — of no one but herself .
Upon the little she earned she lived as well as she could ; now there were two to be supported , and nothing to live upon .
<unk> approached .
Mercédès had no fire in that cold and naked room — she , who was accustomed to <unk> which <unk> the house from the hall to the <unk> ; she had not even one little flower — she whose apartment had been a <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
But she had her son .
<unk> the excitement of <unk> a duty had sustained them .
<unk> , like enthusiasm , sometimes renders us unconscious to the things of earth .
But the excitement had <unk> down , and they felt themselves obliged to descend from dreams to reality ; after having exhausted the ideal , they found they must talk of the actual .
“ Mother , ” exclaimed Albert , just as Madame Danglars was descending the stairs , “ let us <unk> our riches , if you please ; I want capital to <unk> my plans upon . ” “ <unk> — nothing ! ” replied Mercédès with a mournful smile .
“ No , mother , — capital <unk> francs .
And I have an idea of our leading a delightful life upon this <unk> francs . ” “ <unk> ! ” sighed Mercédès .
“ Alas , dear mother , ” said the young man , “ I have <unk> spent too much of your money not to know the value of it .
These <unk> francs are enormous , and I intend building upon this foundation a <unk> certainty for the future . ” “ You say this , my dear boy ; but do you think we ought to accept these <unk> francs ? ” said Mercédès , <unk> .
“ I think so , ” answered Albert in a firm tone .
“ We will accept them the more readily , since we have them not here ; you know they are buried in the garden of the little house in the <unk> de <unk> , at Marseilles .
With <unk> francs we can reach Marseilles . ” “ With <unk> francs ? — are you sure , Albert ? ” “ Oh , as for that , I have made inquiries respecting the <unk> and <unk> , and my <unk> are made .
You will take your place in the _ <unk> _ to <unk> .
You see , mother , I treat you <unk> for <unk> francs . ” Albert then took a pen , and wrote : <unk> .
_ <unk> _ , <unk> francs <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
From <unk> to <unk> you will go on by the <unk> <unk> 6 .
From <unk> to <unk> ( still by <unk> ) .... <unk> <unk> .
From <unk> to Marseilles , seven francs <unk> <unk> 7 .
<unk> on the road , about fifty francs <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
“ Let us put down <unk> , ” added Albert , smiling .
“ You see I am generous , am I not , mother ? ” “ But you , my poor child ? ” “ I ?
do you not see that I reserve eighty francs for myself ?
A young man does not require <unk> ; besides , I know what travelling is . ” “ With a <unk> and valet de chambre ? ” “ Any way , mother . ” “ Well , be it so .
But these <unk> francs ? ” “ Here they are , and <unk> more besides .
See , I have sold my watch for <unk> francs , and the guard and <unk> for <unk> .
How fortunate that the <unk> were worth more than the watch .
Still the same story of <unk> !
Now I think we are rich , since instead of the <unk> francs we require for the journey we find ourselves in possession of <unk> . ” “ But we owe something in this house ? ” “ <unk> francs ; but I pay that out of my <unk> francs , — that is understood , — and as I require only eighty francs for my journey , you see I am overwhelmed with luxury .
But that is not all .
What do you say to this , mother ? ” And Albert took out of a little pocket-book with golden <unk> , a <unk> of his old fancies , or perhaps a tender <unk> from one of the mysterious and veiled ladies who used to knock at his little door , — Albert took out of this pocket-book a note of <unk> francs .
“ What is this ? ” asked Mercédès .
“ A thousand francs . ” “ But whence have you obtained them ? ” “ Listen to me , mother , and do not yield too much to agitation . ” And Albert , rising , kissed his mother on both cheeks , then stood looking at her .
“ You cannot imagine , mother , how beautiful I think you ! ” said the young man , impressed with a profound feeling of <unk> love .
“ You are , indeed , the most beautiful and most noble woman I ever saw ! ” “ Dear child ! ” said Mercédès , endeavoring in vain to restrain a tear which <unk> in the corner of her eye .
“ Indeed , you only wanted misfortune to change my love for you to admiration .
I am not unhappy while I possess my son ! ” “ Ah , just so , ” said Albert ; “ here begins the trial .
Do you know the decision we have come to , mother ? ” “ Have we come to any ? ” “ Yes ; it is decided that you are to live at Marseilles , and that I am to leave for <unk> , where I will earn for myself the right to use the name I now bear , instead of the one I have thrown aside . ” Mercédès sighed .
“ Well , mother , I yesterday engaged myself as <unk> in the <unk> , ” <unk> added the young man , <unk> his eyes with a certain feeling of shame , for even he was unconscious of the <unk> of his <unk> .
“ I thought my body was my own , and that I might sell it .
I yesterday took the place of another .
I sold myself for more than I thought I was worth , ” he added , <unk> to smile ; “ I <unk> <unk> francs . ” “ Then these <unk> francs — — ” said Mercédès , shuddering .
“ Are the half of the sum , mother ; the other will be paid in a year . ” Mercédès raised her eyes to heaven with an expression it would be impossible to describe , and tears , which had hitherto been restrained , now yielded to her emotion , and ran down her cheeks .
“ The price of his blood ! ” she murmured .
“ Yes , if I am killed , ” said Albert , laughing .
“ But I assure you , mother , I have a strong intention of <unk> my person , and I never felt half so strong an inclination to live as I do now . ” “ <unk> <unk> ! ” “ Besides , mother , why should you make up your mind that I am to be killed ?
Has <unk> , that <unk> of the South , been killed ?
Has <unk> been killed ?
Has <unk> been killed ?
Has Morrel , whom we know , been killed ?
Think of your joy , mother , when you see me return with an embroidered uniform !
I declare , I expect to look magnificent in it , and chose that regiment only from vanity . ” Mercédès sighed while endeavoring to smile ; the devoted mother felt that she ought not to allow the whole weight of the sacrifice to fall upon her son .
“ Well , now you understand , mother ! ” continued Albert ; “ here are more than <unk> francs settled on you ; upon these you can live at least two years . ” “ Do you think so ? ” said Mercédès .
These words were uttered in so mournful a tone that their real meaning did not escape Albert ; he felt his heart beat , and taking his mother ’ s hand within his own he said , tenderly : “ Yes , you will live ! ” “ I shall live ! — then you will not leave me , Albert ? ” “ Mother , I must go , ” said Albert in a firm , calm voice ; “ you love me too well to wish me to remain useless and idle with you ; besides , I have signed . ” <unk> “ You will obey your own wish and the will of Heaven ! ” “ Not my own wish , mother , but reason — necessity .
Are we not two despairing creatures ?
What is life to you ? — Nothing .
What is life to me ? — Very little without you , mother ; for believe me , but for you I should have ceased to live on the day I doubted my father and <unk> his name .
Well , I will live , if you promise me still to hope ; and if you grant me the care of your future prospects , you will <unk> my strength .
Then I will go to the governor of <unk> ; he has a royal heart , and is <unk> a soldier ; I will tell him my gloomy story .
I will beg him to turn his eyes now and then towards me , and if he keep his word and interest himself for me , in six months I shall be an officer , or dead .
If I am an officer , your fortune is certain , for I shall have money enough for both , and , moreover , a name we shall both be proud of , since it will be our own .
If I am killed — well then mother , you can also die , and there will be an end of our misfortunes . ” “ It is well , ” replied Mercédès , with her <unk> glance ; “ you are right , my love ; let us prove to those who are watching our actions that we are worthy of compassion . ” “ But let us not yield to gloomy <unk> , ” said the young man ; “ I assure you we are , or rather we shall be , very happy .
You are a woman at once full of spirit and resignation ; I have become simple in my <unk> , and am without passion , I hope .
Once in service , I shall be rich — once in M. Dantès ’ house , you will be at rest .
Let us <unk> , I <unk> you , — let us <unk> to be cheerful . ” “ Yes , let us <unk> , for you ought to live , and to be happy , Albert . ” “ And so our division is made , mother , ” said the young man , <unk> ease of mind .
“ We can now part ; come , I shall engage your passage . ” “ And you , my dear boy ? ” “ I shall stay here for a few days longer ; we must <unk> ourselves to parting .
I want <unk> and some information relative to <unk> .
I will join you again at Marseilles . ” “ Well , be it so — let us part , ” said Mercédès , <unk> around her shoulders the only shawl she had taken away , and which <unk> happened to be a valuable black <unk> .
Albert gathered up his papers hastily , rang the bell to pay the thirty francs he owed to the landlord , and offering his arm to his mother , they descended the stairs .
<unk> was walking down before them , and this person , hearing the <unk> of a silk dress , turned around .
“ Debray ! ” muttered Albert .
“ You , Morcerf ? ” replied the secretary , resting on the stairs .
<unk> had <unk> the desire of <unk> his _ <unk> _ , and he was recognized .
It was , indeed , strange in this unknown spot to find the young man whose misfortunes had made so much noise in Paris .
“ Morcerf ! ” repeated Debray .
Then <unk> in the dim light the still youthful and veiled figure of Madame de Morcerf : “ Pardon me , ” he added with a smile , “ I leave you , Albert . ” Albert understood his thoughts .
“ Mother , ” he said , turning towards Mercédès , “ this is M. Debray , secretary of the <unk> for the <unk> , once a friend of mine . ” “ How once ? ” stammered Debray ; “ what do you mean ? ” “ I say so , M. Debray , because I have no friends now , and I ought not to have any .
I thank you for having recognized me , sir . ” Debray stepped forward , and <unk> pressed the hand of his <unk> .
“ Believe me , dear Albert , ” he said , with all the emotion he was capable of feeling , — “ believe me , I feel deeply for your misfortunes , and if in any way I can serve you , I am yours . ” “ Thank you , sir , ” said Albert , smiling .
“ In the midst of our misfortunes , we are still rich enough not to require assistance from anyone .
We are leaving Paris , and when our journey is paid , we shall have <unk> francs left . ” The blood mounted to the <unk> of Debray , who held a million in his pocket-book , and <unk> as he was he could not help <unk> that the same house had contained two women , one of whom , <unk> <unk> , had left it poor with <unk> francs under her cloak , while the other , <unk> <unk> , but sublime in her misfortune , was yet rich with a few <unk> .
This <unk> disturbed his usual politeness , the philosophy he witnessed <unk> him , he muttered a few words of general civility and ran downstairs .
That day the minister ’ s <unk> and the <unk> had a great deal to put up with from his <unk> .
But that same night , he found himself the <unk> of a fine house , situated on the Boulevard de la Madeleine , and an income of <unk> livres .
The next day , just as Debray was <unk> the deed , that is about five o ’ clock in the afternoon , Madame de Morcerf , after having <unk> embraced her son , entered the _ <unk> _ of the diligence , which closed upon her .
A man was hidden in <unk> ’ s <unk> , behind one of the little <unk> windows which are placed above each desk ; he saw Mercédès enter the diligence , and he also saw Albert <unk> .
Then he passed his hand across his forehead , which was <unk> with doubt .
“ Alas , ” he exclaimed , “ how can I restore the happiness I have taken away from these poor innocent creatures ?
God help me ! ” Chapter <unk> .
The <unk> ’ <unk> One division of La <unk> , in which the most dangerous and desperate prisoners are confined , is called the court of <unk> .
The prisoners , in their expressive language , have named it the “ <unk> ’ <unk> , ” probably because the <unk> possess teeth which frequently <unk> the bars , and sometimes the <unk> also .
It is a prison within a prison ; the walls are double the <unk> of the rest .
The <unk> are every day carefully examined by <unk> , whose <unk> <unk> and cold <unk> expression prove them to have been chosen to <unk> over their subjects for their superior activity and intelligence .
The courtyard of this quarter is <unk> by enormous walls , over which the sun glances <unk> , when it <unk> to penetrate into this gulf of moral and physical <unk> .
On this <unk> yard are to be seen , — <unk> to and fro from morning till night , pale , <unk> , and haggard , like so many shadows , — the men whom justice holds beneath the steel she is <unk> .
There , <unk> against the side of the wall which <unk> and <unk> the most heat , they may be seen sometimes talking to one another , but more frequently alone , watching the door , which sometimes opens to call forth one from the gloomy <unk> , or to throw in another <unk> from society .
The court of <unk> has its own particular apartment for the reception of guests ; it is a long <unk> , divided by two upright <unk> placed at a distance of three feet from one another to prevent a visitor from shaking hands with or passing anything to the prisoners .
It is a wretched , damp , nay , even horrible spot , more especially when we consider the <unk> <unk> which have taken place between those iron bars .
And yet , frightful though this spot may be , it is looked upon as a kind of paradise by the men whose days are <unk> ; it is so rare for them to leave the <unk> ’ <unk> for any other place than the barrier Saint-Jacques , the galleys !
or solitary <unk> .
In the court which we have attempted to describe , and from which a damp <unk> was rising , a young man with his hands in his pockets , who had excited much curiosity among the inhabitants of the “ <unk> , ” might be seen walking .
The cut of his clothes would have made him pass for an elegant man , if those clothes had not been torn to <unk> ; still they did not show signs of wear , and the fine cloth , beneath the careful hands of the prisoner , soon recovered its <unk> in the parts which were still perfect , for the <unk> tried his best to make it assume the appearance of a new coat .
He bestowed the same attention upon the <unk> front of a shirt , which had <unk> changed in color since his entrance into the prison , and he polished his <unk> boots with the corner of a handkerchief embroidered with <unk> surmounted by a <unk> .
Some of the <unk> of the “ <unk> ’ <unk> ” were watching the <unk> of the prisoner ’ s toilet with considerable interest .
“ See , the prince is <unk> himself , ” said one of the thieves .
“ He ’ s a fine looking fellow , ” said another ; “ if he had only a <unk> and <unk> , he ’ d take the <unk> off the gentlemen in white <unk> . ” “ His coat looks nearly new , and his boots are brilliant .
It is pleasant to have such <unk> <unk> ; and those gendarmes behaved <unk> .
What jealousy ; to tear such clothes ! ” “ He looks like a <unk> , ” said another ; “ <unk> in fine style .
And , then , to be here so young !
Oh , what <unk> ! ” Meanwhile the object of this hideous admiration approached the <unk> , against which one of the <unk> was leaning .
“ Come , sir , ” he said , “ lend me twenty francs ; you will soon be paid ; you run no <unk> with me .
Remember , I have relations who possess more millions than you have <unk> .
Come , I <unk> you , lend me twenty francs , so that I may buy a <unk> ; it is <unk> always to be in a coat and boots !
And what a coat , sir , for a prince of the Cavalcanti ! ” The <unk> turned his back , and shrugged his shoulders ; he did not even laugh at what would have caused anyone else to do so ; he had heard so many utter the same things , — indeed , he heard nothing else .
“ Come , ” said Andrea , “ you are a man void of compassion ; I ’ ll have you turned out . ” This made the <unk> turn around , and he burst into a loud laugh .
The prisoners then approached and formed a circle .
“ I tell you that with that wretched sum , ” continued Andrea , “ I could obtain a coat , and a room in which to receive the illustrious visitor I am daily expecting . ” “ Of course — of course , ” said the prisoners ; — “ anyone can see he ’ s a gentleman ! ” “ Well , then , lend him the twenty francs , ” said the <unk> , leaning on the other shoulder ; “ surely you will not refuse a comrade ! ” <unk> “ I am no comrade of these people , ” said the young man , <unk> , “ you have no right to insult me thus . ” The thieves looked at one another with low <unk> , and a storm gathered over the head of the <unk> prisoner , raised less by his own words than by the manner of the <unk> .
The latter , sure of <unk> the tempest when the waves became too violent , allowed them to rise to a certain <unk> that he might be <unk> on the <unk> Andrea , and besides it would afford him some <unk> during the long day .
The thieves had already approached Andrea , some <unk> , _ “ La <unk> — La <unk> ! ” _ <unk> a cruel operation , which <unk> in <unk> a comrade who may have fallen into disgrace , not with an old <unk> , but with an <unk> one .
<unk> proposed the _ <unk> _ , another kind of <unk> , in which a handkerchief is filled with sand , <unk> , and <unk> pieces , when they have them , which the <unk> beat like a <unk> over the head and shoulders of the unhappy <unk> .
“ Let us <unk> the fine gentleman ! ” said others .
But Andrea , turning towards them , <unk> his eyes , rolled his tongue around his cheeks , and <unk> his lips in a manner <unk> to a hundred words among the bandits when forced to be silent .
It was a <unk> sign Caderousse had taught him .
He was immediately recognized as one of them ; the handkerchief was thrown down , and the <unk> <unk> replaced on the foot of the wretch to whom it belonged .
Some voices were heard to say that the gentleman was right ; that he intended to be civil , in his way , and that they would set the example of liberty of conscience , — and the <unk> retired .
The <unk> was so stupefied at this scene that he took Andrea by the hands and began examining his person , <unk> the sudden <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> ’ <unk> to something more <unk> than mere <unk> .
Andrea made no resistance , although he <unk> against it .
Suddenly a voice was heard at the <unk> .
“ Benedetto ! ” exclaimed an inspector .
The <unk> <unk> his hold .
“ I am called , ” said Andrea .
“ To the visitors ’ room ! ” said the same voice .
“ You see someone <unk> me a visit .
Ah , my dear sir , you will see whether a Cavalcanti is to be treated like a common person ! ” And Andrea , <unk> through the court like a black shadow , rushed out through the <unk> , leaving his comrades , and even the <unk> , lost in wonder .
Certainly a call to the visitors ’ room had scarcely astonished Andrea less than themselves , for the <unk> youth , instead of making use of his privilege of waiting to be <unk> on his entry into La <unk> , had <unk> a <unk> silence .
<unk> “ Everything , ” he said , “ <unk> me to be under the protection of some powerful person , — this sudden fortune , the <unk> with which I have overcome all <unk> , an unexpected family and an illustrious name <unk> to me , gold <unk> down upon me , and the most splendid <unk> about to be entered into .
An unhappy <unk> of fortune and the absence of my protector have cast me down , certainly , but not forever .
The hand which has retreated for a while will be again stretched forth to save me at the very moment when I shall think myself sinking into the abyss .
Why should I risk an imprudent step ?
It might <unk> my protector .
He has two means of <unk> me from this <unk> , — the one by a mysterious escape , managed through <unk> ; the other by <unk> off my judges with gold .
I will say and do nothing until I am convinced that he has quite abandoned me , and then — — ” Andrea had formed a plan which was tolerably clever .
The unfortunate youth was <unk> in the attack , and rude in the defence .
He had borne with the public prison , and with <unk> of all sorts ; still , by degrees nature , or rather custom , had prevailed , and he suffered from being naked , dirty , and hungry .
It was at this moment of <unk> that the inspector ’ s voice called him to the <unk> .
Andrea felt his heart <unk> with joy .
It was too soon for a visit from the examining magistrate , and too late for one from the <unk> of the prison , or the doctor ; it must , then , be the visitor he hoped for .
Behind the grating of the room into which Andrea had been led , he saw , while his eyes <unk> with surprise , the dark and intelligent face of M. Bertuccio , who was also gazing with sad astonishment upon the iron bars , the <unk> doors , and the shadow which moved behind the other grating .
“ Ah , ” said Andrea , deeply affected .
“ Good morning , Benedetto , ” said Bertuccio , with his deep , hollow voice .
“ You — you ? ” said the young man , looking <unk> around him .
“ Do you not recognize me , unhappy child ? ” “ Silence , — be silent ! ” said Andrea , who knew the delicate sense of hearing possessed by the walls ; “ for Heaven ’ s sake , do not speak so loud ! ” “ You wish to speak with me alone , do you not ? ” said Bertuccio .
“ Oh , yes . ” “ That is well . ” And Bertuccio , feeling in his pocket , signed to a <unk> whom he saw through the window of the <unk> .
“ <unk> ? ” he said .
“ What is that ? ” asked Andrea .
“ An order to conduct you to a room , and to leave you there to talk to me . ” “ Oh , ” cried Andrea , <unk> with joy .
Then he <unk> added , — “ Still my unknown protector !
I am not forgotten .
They wish for <unk> , since we are to <unk> in a private room .
I understand , Bertuccio has been sent by my protector . ” The <unk> spoke for a moment with an official , then opened the iron gates and conducted Andrea to a room on the first floor .
The room was <unk> , as is the custom in prisons , but it looked quite brilliant to a prisoner , though a stove , a bed , a chair , and a table formed the whole of its <unk> furniture .
Bertuccio sat down upon the chair , Andrea threw himself upon the bed ; the <unk> retired .
“ Now , ” said the steward , “ what have you to tell me ? ” “ And you ? ” said Andrea .
“ You speak first . ” “ Oh , no .
You must have much to tell me , since you have come to seek me . ” <unk> “ Well , be it so .
You have continued your course of <unk> ; you have robbed — you have assassinated . ” “ Well , I should say !
If you had me taken to a private room only to tell me this , you might have saved yourself the trouble .
I know all these things .
But there are some with which , on the contrary , I am not acquainted .
Let us talk of those , if you please .
Who sent you ? ” “ Come , come , you are going on quickly , M. Benedetto ! ” “ Yes , and to the point .
Let us <unk> with useless words .
Who sends you ? ” “ No one . ” “ How did you know I was in prison ? ” “ I recognized you , some time since , as the <unk> <unk> who so <unk> mounted his horse in the Champs-Élysées . ” “ Oh , the Champs-Élysées ?
Ah , yes ; we burn , as they say at the game of <unk> .
The Champs-Élysées ?
Come , let us talk a little about my father . ” “ Who , then , am I ? ” “ You , sir ? — you are my adopted father .
But it was not you , I presume , who placed at my disposal <unk> francs , which I spent in four or five months ; it was not you who <unk> an Italian gentleman for my father ; it was not you who introduced me into the world , and had me invited to a certain dinner at Auteuil , which I fancy I am eating at this moment , in company with the most distinguished people in Paris — amongst the rest with a certain procureur , whose acquaintance I did very wrong not to <unk> , for he would have been very useful to me just now ; — it was not you , in fact , who <unk> me for one or two millions , when the fatal discovery of my little secret took place .
Come , speak , my worthy Corsican , speak ! ” “ What do you wish me to say ? ” “ I will help you .
You were speaking of the Champs-Élysées just now , worthy <unk> . ” “ Well ? ” “ Well , in the Champs-Élysées there <unk> a very rich gentleman . ” “ At whose house you robbed and murdered , did you not ? ” “ I believe I did . ” “ The Count of Monte Cristo ? ” “ ’ Tis you who have named him , as M. <unk> says .
Well , am I to rush into his arms , and strain him to my heart , crying , ‘ My father , my father ! ’ like Monsieur <unk> . ” <unk> “ Do not let us jest , ” gravely replied Bertuccio , “ and dare not to utter that name again as you have pronounced it . ” “ Bah , ” said Andrea , a little overcome , by the solemnity of Bertuccio ’ s manner , “ why not ? ” “ Because the person who bears it is too highly <unk> by Heaven to be the father of such a wretch as you . ” “ Oh , these are fine words . ” “ And there will be fine <unk> , if you do not take care . ” “ <unk> — I do not fear them .
I will say — — ” “ Do you think you are engaged with a <unk> like yourself ? ” said Bertuccio , in so calm a tone , and with so <unk> a look , that Andrea was moved to the very soul .
“ Do you think you have to do with <unk> , or <unk> in the world ?
Benedetto , you are fallen into terrible hands ; they are ready to open for you — make use of them .
Do not play with the <unk> they have laid aside for a moment , but which they can take up again instantly , if you attempt to <unk> their movements . ” <unk> “ My father — I will know who my father is , ” said the <unk> youth ; “ I will <unk> if I must , but I _ will _ know it .
What does <unk> signify to me ?
What <unk> , what reputation , what ‘ <unk> , ’ as Beauchamp says , — have I ?
You great people always lose something by <unk> , notwithstanding your millions .
Come , who is my father ? ” “ I came to tell you . ” “ Ah , ” cried Benedetto , his eyes sparkling with joy .
Just then the door opened , and the jailer , addressing himself to Bertuccio , said : “ Excuse me , sir , but the examining magistrate is waiting for the prisoner . ” “ And so <unk> our interview , ” said Andrea to the worthy steward ; “ I wish the troublesome fellow were at the devil ! ” “ I will return tomorrow , ” said Bertuccio .
“ Good !
<unk> , I am at your service .
Ah , sir , do leave a few crowns for me at the gate that I may have some things I am in need of ! ” “ It shall be done , ” replied Bertuccio .
Andrea extended his hand ; Bertuccio kept his own in his pocket , and merely <unk> a few pieces of money .
“ That ’ s what I mean , ” said Andrea , endeavoring to smile , quite overcome by the strange tranquillity of Bertuccio .
“ Can I be deceived ? ” he murmured , as he stepped into the <unk> and grated vehicle which they call “ the <unk> basket . ” “ Never mind , we shall see !
<unk> , then ! ” he added , turning towards Bertuccio .
“ <unk> ! ” replied the steward .
Chapter <unk> .
The <unk> We remember that the Abbé Busoni remained alone with Noirtier in the chamber of death , and that the old man and the priest were the sole <unk> of the young girl ’ s body .
Perhaps it was the Christian <unk> of the abbé , perhaps his kind charity , perhaps his <unk> words , which had restored the courage of Noirtier , for ever since he had <unk> with the priest his violent despair had yielded to a calm resignation which surprised all who knew his excessive affection for Valentine .
M. de Villefort had not seen his father since the morning of the death .
The whole establishment had been changed ; another valet was engaged for himself , a new servant for Noirtier , two women had entered Madame de Villefort ’ s service , — in fact , everywhere , to the concierge and <unk> , new faces were presented to the different masters of the house , thus <unk> the division which had always existed between the members of the same family .
The <unk> , also , were about to begin , and Villefort , shut up in his room , <unk> himself with feverish anxiety in drawing up the case against the murderer of Caderousse .
This affair , like all those in which the Count of Monte Cristo had <unk> , caused a great sensation in Paris .
The proofs were certainly not <unk> , since they rested upon a few words written by an escaped <unk> on his <unk> , and who might have been <unk> by hatred or revenge in <unk> his companion .
But the mind of the procureur was made up ; he felt assured that Benedetto was guilty , and he hoped by his skill in <unk> this <unk> case to <unk> his <unk> , which was about the only <unk> point left in his <unk> heart .
The case was therefore prepared owing to the <unk> labor of Villefort , who wished it to be the first on the list in the coming <unk> .
He had been obliged to <unk> himself more than ever , to <unk> the enormous number of <unk> presented to him for the purpose of obtaining <unk> of <unk> to the court on the day of trial .
And then so short a time had elapsed since the death of poor Valentine , and the gloom which <unk> the house was so recent , that no one wondered to see the father so absorbed in his <unk> duties , which were the only means he had of <unk> his grief .
Once only had Villefort seen his father ; it was the day after that upon which Bertuccio had paid his second visit to Benedetto , when the latter was to learn his father ’ s name .
The magistrate , <unk> and fatigued , had descended to the garden of his house , and in a gloomy <unk> , similar to that in which <unk> <unk> off the <unk> <unk> , he began <unk> off with his cane the long and dying branches of the <unk> , which , placed along the <unk> , seemed like the <unk> of the brilliant flowers which had <unk> in the past season .
More than once he had reached that part of the garden where the famous <unk> gate stood <unk> the deserted enclosure , always returning by the same path , to begin his walk again , at the same pace and with the same gesture , when he <unk> turned his eyes towards the house , whence he heard the <unk> play of his son , who had returned from school to spend the Sunday and <unk> with his mother .
While doing so , he observed M. Noirtier at one of the open windows , where the old man had been placed that he might enjoy the last rays of the sun which yet yielded some heat , and was now shining upon the dying flowers and red leaves of the <unk> which <unk> around the <unk> .
The eye of the old man was <unk> upon a spot which Villefort could scarcely distinguish .
His glance was so full of hate , of <unk> , and savage impatience , that Villefort turned out of the path he had been pursuing , to see upon what person this dark look was directed .
Then he saw beneath a thick <unk> of <unk> , which were nearly <unk> of <unk> , Madame de Villefort sitting with a book in her hand , the <unk> of which she frequently interrupted to smile upon her son , or to throw back his <unk> ball , which he <unk> threw from the drawing-room into the garden .
Villefort became pale ; he understood the old man ’ s meaning .
Noirtier continued to look at the same object , but suddenly his glance was <unk> from the wife to the husband , and Villefort himself had to submit to the searching <unk> of eyes , which , while changing their direction and even their language , had lost none of their <unk> expression .
Madame de Villefort , unconscious of the passions that exhausted their fire over her head , at that moment held her son ’ s ball , and was making signs to him to <unk> it with a kiss .
Edward begged for a long while , the <unk> kiss probably not offering sufficient recompense for the trouble he must take to obtain it ; however at length he decided , leaped out of the window into a <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , and ran to his mother , his forehead <unk> with perspiration .
Madame de Villefort wiped his forehead , pressed her lips upon it , and sent him back with the ball in one hand and some <unk> in the other .
Villefort , drawn by an irresistible <unk> , like that of the bird to the <unk> , walked towards the house .
As he approached it , Noirtier ’ s gaze followed him , and his eyes appeared of such a <unk> <unk> that Villefort felt them <unk> to the depths of his heart .
In that earnest look might be read a deep reproach , as well as a terrible <unk> .
Then Noirtier raised his eyes to heaven , as though to remind his son of a forgotten oath .
“ It is well , sir , ” replied Villefort from below , — “ it is well ; have patience but one day longer ; what I have said I will do . ” Noirtier seemed to be <unk> by these words , and turned his eyes with indifference to the other side .
Villefort violently <unk> his <unk> , which seemed to <unk> him , and passing his livid hand across his forehead , entered his study .
The night was cold and still ; the family had all retired to rest but Villefort , who alone remained up , and worked till five o ’ clock in the morning , <unk> the last <unk> made the night before by the examining <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of the witnesses , and putting the <unk> stroke to the deed of accusation , which was one of the most energetic and best conceived of any he had yet delivered .
The next day , <unk> , was the first sitting of the <unk> .
The morning <unk> dull and gloomy , and Villefort saw the dim gray light <unk> upon the lines he had traced in red ink .
The magistrate had slept for a short time while the lamp sent forth its final <unk> ; its <unk> awoke him , and he found his fingers as damp and purple as though they had been <unk> in blood .
He opened the window ; a bright yellow <unk> crossed the sky , and seemed to <unk> in half the <unk> , which stood out in black relief on the horizon .
In the <unk> beyond the <unk> , a <unk> was <unk> up to heaven , while <unk> out her clear morning song .
The <unk> of the <unk> bathed the head of Villefort , and <unk> his memory .
“ <unk> , ” he said with an effort , — “ today the man who holds the <unk> of justice must strike wherever there is guilt . ” <unk> his eyes wandered towards the window of Noirtier ’ s room , where he had seen him the preceding night .
The curtain was drawn , and yet the image of his father was so <unk> to his mind that he addressed the closed window as though it had been open , and as if through the opening he had beheld the <unk> old man .
“ Yes , ” he murmured , — “ yes , be satisfied . ” His head dropped upon his chest , and in this position he <unk> his study ; then he threw himself , dressed as he was , upon a sofa , less to sleep than to rest his limbs , <unk> with cold and study .
By degrees everyone awoke .
Villefort , from his study , heard the <unk> <unk> which accompany the life of a house , — the opening and <unk> of doors , the <unk> of Madame de Villefort ’ s bell , to summon the <unk> , mingled with the first shouts of the child , who rose full of the enjoyment of his age .
Villefort also rang ; his new valet brought him the papers , and with them a cup of <unk> .
“ What are you bringing me ? ” said he .
“ A cup of <unk> . ” “ I did not ask for it .
Who has paid me this attention ? ” “ My mistress , sir .
She said you would have to speak a great deal in the murder case , and that you should take something to keep up your strength ; ” and the valet placed the cup on the table nearest to the sofa , which was , like all the rest , covered with papers .
The valet then left the room .
Villefort looked for an instant with a gloomy expression , then , suddenly , taking it up with a nervous motion , he swallowed its contents at one draught .
It might have been thought that he hoped the <unk> would be mortal , and that he sought for death to deliver him from a duty which he would rather die than fulfil .
He then rose , and <unk> his room with a smile it would have been terrible to witness .
The <unk> was <unk> , for M. de Villefort felt no effects .
The <unk> arrived , but M. de Villefort was not at table .
The valet re-entered .
“ Madame de Villefort wishes to remind you , sir , ” he said , “ that eleven o ’ clock has just struck , and that the trial <unk> at twelve . ” “ Well , ” said Villefort , “ what then ? ” “ Madame de Villefort is dressed ; she is quite ready , and wishes to know if she is to accompany you , sir ? ” “ Where to ? ” “ To the <unk> . ” “ What to do ? ” “ My mistress wishes much to be present at the trial . ” “ Ah , ” said Villefort , with a startling accent ; “ does she wish that ? ” The servant drew back and said , “ If you wish to go alone , sir , I will go and tell my mistress . ” Villefort remained silent for a moment , and <unk> his pale cheeks with his nails .
“ Tell your mistress , ” he at length answered , “ that I wish to speak to her , and I beg she will wait for me in her own room . ” “ Yes , sir . ” “ Then come to dress and <unk> me . ” “ <unk> , sir . ” The valet <unk> almost instantly , and , having <unk> his master , assisted him to dress entirely in black .
When he had finished , he said : “ My mistress said she should expect you , sir , as soon as you had finished <unk> . ” “ I am going to her . ” And Villefort , with his papers under his arm and hat in hand , directed his steps toward the apartment of his wife .
At the door he paused for a moment to <unk> his damp , pale brow .
He then entered the room .
Madame de Villefort was sitting on an <unk> and impatiently turning over the leaves of some newspapers and <unk> which young Edward , by way of amusing himself , was tearing to pieces before his mother could finish reading them .
She was dressed to go out , her bonnet was placed beside her on a chair , and her gloves were on her hands .
“ Ah , here you are , monsieur , ” she said in her naturally calm voice ; “ but how pale you are !
Have you been working all night ?
Why did you not come down to breakfast ?
Well , will you take me , or shall I take Edward ? ” Madame de Villefort had <unk> her questions in order to gain one answer , but to all her inquiries M. de Villefort remained mute and cold as a statue .
“ Edward , ” said Villefort , fixing an <unk> glance on the child , “ go and play in the drawing-room , my dear ; I wish to speak to your <unk> . ” Madame de Villefort shuddered at the sight of that cold countenance , that resolute tone , and the <unk> strange <unk> .
Edward raised his head , looked at his mother , and then , finding that she did not <unk> the order , began cutting off the heads of his <unk> soldiers .
“ Edward , ” cried M. de Villefort , so <unk> that the child started up from the floor , “ do you hear me ? — Go ! ” The child , <unk> to such treatment , arose , pale and trembling ; it would be difficult to say whether his emotion were caused by fear or passion .
His father went up to him , took him in his arms , and kissed his forehead .
“ Go , ” he said : “ go , my child . ” Edward ran out .
M. de Villefort went to the door , which he closed behind the child , and <unk> .
“ Dear me ! ” said the young woman , endeavoring to read her husband ’ s <unk> thoughts , while a smile passed over her countenance which <unk> the <unk> of Villefort ; “ what is the matter ? ” “ Madame , where do you keep the poison you generally use ? ” said the magistrate , without any introduction , placing himself between his wife and the door .
Madame de Villefort must have experienced something of the sensation of a bird which , looking up , sees the <unk> trap closing over its head .
A hoarse , broken tone , which was neither a cry nor a sigh , escaped from her , while she became deadly pale .
“ Monsieur , ” she said , “ I — I do not understand you . ” And , in her first <unk> of terror , she had raised herself from the sofa , in the next , stronger very likely than the other , she fell down again on the <unk> .
“ I asked you , ” continued Villefort , in a perfectly calm tone , “ where you conceal the poison by the aid of which you have killed my <unk> , M. de Saint-Méran , my <unk> , Madame de Saint-Méran , Barrois , and my daughter Valentine . ” “ Ah , sir , ” exclaimed Madame de Villefort , <unk> her hands , “ what do you say ? ” “ It is not for you to <unk> , but to answer . ” “ Is it to the judge or to the husband ? ” stammered Madame de Villefort .
“ To the judge — to the judge , madame ! ” It was terrible to behold the frightful pallor of that woman , the anguish of her look , the trembling of her whole frame .
“ Ah , sir , ” she muttered , “ <unk> , sir , ” and this was all .
“ You do not answer , madame ! ” exclaimed the terrible <unk> .
Then he added , with a smile yet more terrible than his anger , “ It is true , then ; you do not deny it ! ” She moved forward .
“ And you cannot deny it ! ” added Villefort , extending his hand toward her , as though to seize her in the name of justice .
“ You have accomplished these different crimes with <unk> address , but which could only deceive those whose affections for you <unk> them .
Since the death of Madame de Saint-Méran , I have known that a <unk> lived in my house .
M. d ’ Avrigny warned me of it .
After the death of Barrois my suspicions were directed towards an angel , — those suspicions which , even when there is no crime , are always alive in my heart ; but after the death of Valentine , there has been no doubt in my mind , madame , and not only in mine , but in those of others ; thus your crime , known by two persons , suspected by many , will soon become public , and , as I told you just now , you no longer speak to the husband , but to the judge . ” <unk> The young woman hid her face in her hands .
“ Oh , sir , ” she stammered , “ I <unk> you , do not believe appearances . ” “ Are you , then , a coward ? ” cried Villefort , in a <unk> voice .
“ But I have always observed that <unk> were <unk> .
Can you be a coward , you , who have had the courage to witness the death of two old men and a young girl murdered by you ? ” “ Sir !
sir ! ” “ Can you be a coward ? ” continued Villefort , with increasing excitement , “ you , who could count , one by one , the minutes of four death <unk> ?
_ You _ , who have arranged your <unk> plans , and removed the <unk> with a talent and <unk> almost <unk> ?
Have you , then , who have calculated everything with such <unk> , have you forgotten to <unk> one thing — I mean where the <unk> of your crimes will lead you to ?
Oh , it is impossible — you must have saved some <unk> , more <unk> and deadly poison than any other , that you might escape the punishment that you deserve .
You have done this — I hope so , at least . ” Madame de Villefort stretched out her hands , and fell on her knees .
“ I understand , ” he said , “ you confess ; but a confession made to the judges , a confession made at the last moment , <unk> when the crime cannot be denied , <unk> not the punishment <unk> on the guilty ! ” “ The punishment ? ” exclaimed Madame de Villefort , “ the punishment , monsieur ?
<unk> you have pronounced that word ! ” “ Certainly .
Did you hope to escape it because you were four times guilty ?
Did you think the punishment would be <unk> because you are the wife of him who <unk> it ? — No , madame , no ; the scaffold <unk> the <unk> , <unk> she may be , unless , as I just said , the <unk> has taken the precaution of keeping for herself a few drops of her <unk> poison . ” Madame de Villefort uttered a wild cry , and a hideous and <unk> terror spread over her <unk> features .
“ Oh , do not fear the scaffold , madame , ” said the magistrate ; “ I will not <unk> you , since that would be <unk> to myself ; no , if you have heard me distinctly , you will understand that you are not to die on the scaffold . ” “ No , I do not understand ; what do you mean ? ” stammered the unhappy woman , completely overwhelmed .
“ I mean that the wife of the first magistrate in the capital shall not , by her <unk> , soil an <unk> name ; that she shall not , with one blow , <unk> her husband and her child . ” “ No , no — oh , no ! ” “ Well , madame , it will be a <unk> action on your part , and I will thank you for it ! ” “ You will thank me — for what ? ” “ For what you have just said . ” “ What did I say ?
Oh , my brain <unk> ; I no longer understand anything .
Oh , my God , my God ! ” And she rose , with her hair <unk> , and her lips <unk> .
“ Have you answered the question I put to you on entering the room ? — where do you keep the poison you generally use , madame ? ” Madame de Villefort raised her arms to heaven , and convulsively struck one hand against the other .
“ No , no , ” she <unk> , “ no , you cannot wish that ! ” <unk> “ What I do not wish , madame , is that you should <unk> on the scaffold .
Do you understand ? ” asked Villefort .
“ Oh , mercy , mercy , monsieur ! ” “ What I require is , that justice be done .
I am on the earth to <unk> , madame , ” he added , with a <unk> glance ; “ any other woman , were it the <unk> herself , I would send to the executioner ; but to you I shall be <unk> .
To you I will say , ‘ Have you not , madame , put aside some of the <unk> , <unk> , most <unk> poison ? ’ ” <unk> “ Oh , pardon me , sir ; let me live ! ” “ She is <unk> , ” said Villefort .
“ <unk> that I am your wife ! ” “ You are a <unk> . ” “ In the name of Heaven ! ” “ No ! ” “ In the name of the love you once bore me ! ” “ No , no ! ” “ In the name of our child !
Ah , for the sake of our child , let me live ! ” <unk> “ No , no , no , I tell you ; one day , if I allow you to live , you will perhaps kill him , as you have the others ! ” “ I ? — I kill my boy ? ” cried the <unk> mother , rushing toward Villefort ; “ I kill my son ?
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> ! ” and a frightful , <unk> laugh finished the sentence , which was lost in a hoarse <unk> .
Madame de Villefort fell at her husband ’ s feet .
He approached her .
“ Think of it , madame , ” he said ; “ if , on my return , justice has not been satisfied , I will <unk> you with my own mouth , and arrest you with my own hands ! ” She listened , <unk> , overwhelmed , crushed ; her eye alone lived , and <unk> horribly .
“ Do you understand me ? ” he said .
“ I am going down there to pronounce the sentence of death against a murderer .
If I find you alive on my return , you shall sleep tonight in the <unk> . ” Madame de Villefort sighed ; her nerves gave way , and she sunk on the <unk> .
The king ’ s attorney seemed to experience a sensation of pity ; he looked upon her less <unk> , and , bowing to her , said slowly : “ <unk> , madame , farewell ! ” That farewell struck Madame de Villefort like the executioner ’ s knife .
She fainted .
The procureur went out , after having <unk> the door .
Chapter <unk> .
The <unk> The Benedetto affair , as it was called at the <unk> , and by people in general , had produced a tremendous sensation .
<unk> the Café de Paris , the Boulevard de <unk> , and the <unk> de <unk> , during his brief career of splendor , the false Cavalcanti had formed a host of <unk> .
The papers had related his various adventures , both as the man of fashion and the <unk> ; and as everyone who had been <unk> acquainted with Prince Andrea Cavalcanti experienced a lively curiosity in his fate , they all determined to spare no trouble in endeavoring to witness the trial of M. Benedetto for the murder of his comrade in chains .
In the eyes of many , Benedetto appeared , if not a victim to , at least an instance of , the <unk> of the law .
M. Cavalcanti , his father , had been seen in Paris , and it was expected that he would <unk> to claim the illustrious <unk> .
Many , also , who were not aware of the circumstances attending his <unk> from Paris , were struck with the worthy appearance , the <unk> bearing , and the knowledge of the world displayed by the old <unk> , who certainly played the <unk> very well , so long as he said nothing , and made no <unk> <unk> .
As for the accused himself , many remembered him as being so amiable , so handsome , and so liberal , that they chose to think him the victim of some <unk> , since in this world large <unk> frequently excite the <unk> and jealousy of some unknown enemy .
<unk> , therefore , ran to the court ; some to witness the sight , others to <unk> upon it .
From seven o ’ clock in the morning a crowd was stationed at the iron gates , and an hour before the trial <unk> the hall was full of the <unk> .
Before the entrance of the <unk> , and indeed frequently afterwards , a court of justice , on days when some <unk> trial is to take place , resembles a drawing-room where many persons recognize each other and <unk> if they can do so without losing their <unk> ; or , if they are separated by too great a number of <unk> , communicate by signs .
It was one of the magnificent autumn days which make <unk> for a short summer ; the clouds which M. de Villefort had perceived at sunrise had all disappeared as if by <unk> , and one of the <unk> and most brilliant days of September shone forth in all its splendor .
Beauchamp , one of the kings of the press , and therefore <unk> the right of a throne everywhere , was <unk> everybody through his <unk> .
He perceived Château-Renaud and Debray , who had just gained the good <unk> of a <unk> , and who had persuaded the latter to let them stand before , instead of behind him , as they ought to have done .
The worthy sergeant had recognized the minister ’ s secretary and the <unk> , and , by way of paying <unk> attention to his noble neighbors , promised to keep their places while they paid a visit to Beauchamp .
“ Well , ” said Beauchamp , “ we shall see our friend ! ” “ Yes , indeed ! ” replied Debray .
“ That worthy prince .
<unk> take those Italian <unk> ! ” “ A man , too , who could boast of <unk> for a <unk> , and could <unk> back to the _ <unk> <unk> _ . ” “ A nobility of the rope ! ” said Château-Renaud <unk> .
“ He will be condemned , will he not ? ” asked Debray of Beauchamp .
“ My dear fellow , I think we should ask you that question ; you know such news much better than we do .
Did you see the president at the minister ’ s last night ? ” “ Yes . ” “ What did he say ? ” “ Something which will surprise you . ” “ Oh , make haste and tell me , then ; it is a long time since that has happened . ” “ Well , he told me that Benedetto , who is considered a <unk> of <unk> and a <unk> of cunning , is really but a very <unk> , silly rascal , and altogether unworthy of the <unk> that will be made on his <unk> <unk> after his death . ” “ Bah , ” said Beauchamp , “ he played the prince very well . ” “ Yes , for you who <unk> those unhappy <unk> , Beauchamp , and are always delighted to find fault with them ; but not for me , who discover a gentleman by instinct , and who scent out an <unk> family like a very <unk> of <unk> . ” “ Then you never believed in the <unk> ? ” “ Yes . — in the <unk> , but not in the prince . ” “ Not so bad , ” said Beauchamp ; “ still , I assure you , he passed very well with many people ; I saw him at the <unk> ’ houses . ” “ Ah , yes , ” said Château-Renaud .
“ The idea of thinking <unk> understand anything about <unk> ! ” “ There is something in what you have just said , ” said Beauchamp , laughing .
“ But , ” said Debray to Beauchamp , “ if I spoke to the president , _ you _ must have been with the procureur . ” “ It was an <unk> ; for the last week M. de Villefort has <unk> himself .
It is natural enough ; this strange chain of domestic <unk> , followed by the no less strange death of his daughter — — ” “ <unk> ?
What do you mean , Beauchamp ? ” “ Oh , yes ; do you pretend that all this has been <unk> at the minister ’ s ? ” said Beauchamp , placing his <unk> in his eye , where he tried to make it remain .
“ My dear sir , ” said Château-Renaud , “ allow me to tell you that you do not understand that <unk> with the <unk> half so well as Debray .
Give him a lesson , Debray . ” “ Stay , ” said Beauchamp , “ surely I am not deceived . ” “ What is it ? ” “ It is she ! ” “ <unk> do you mean ? ” “ They said she had left . ” “ Mademoiselle Eugénie ? ” said Château-Renaud ; “ has she returned ? ” “ No , but her mother . ” “ Madame Danglars ?
<unk> !
Impossible ! ” said Château-Renaud ; “ only ten days after the flight of her daughter , and three days from the <unk> of her husband ? ” Debray <unk> slightly , and followed with his eyes the direction of Beauchamp ’ s glance .
“ Come , ” he said , “ it is only a veiled lady , some foreign <unk> , perhaps the mother of Cavalcanti .
But you were just speaking on a very interesting <unk> , Beauchamp . ” “ I ? ” “ Yes ; you were telling us about the extraordinary death of Valentine . ” “ Ah , yes , so I was .
But how is it that Madame de Villefort is not here ? ” “ Poor , dear woman , ” said Debray , “ she is no doubt occupied in <unk> <unk> for the <unk> , or in making <unk> for herself or friends .
Do you know she <unk> two or three thousand crowns a year in this amusement ?
But I wonder she is not here .
I should have been pleased to see her , for I like her very much . ” “ And I hate her , ” said Château-Renaud .
“ Why ? ” “ I do not know .
Why do we love ?
Why do we hate ?
I <unk> her , from <unk> . ” “ Or , rather , by instinct . ” “ Perhaps so .
But to return to what you were saying , Beauchamp . ” “ Well , do you know why they die so <unk> at M. de Villefort ’ s ? ” “ ‘ <unk> ’ is good , ” said Château-Renaud .
“ My good fellow , you ’ ll find the word in <unk> . ” “ But the thing itself is at M. de Villefort ’ s ; but let ’ s get back to the subject . ” “ <unk> of that , ” said Debray , “ Madame was making inquiries about that house , which for the last three months has been hung with black . ” “ Who is Madame ? ” asked Château-Renaud .
“ The minister ’ s wife , _ <unk> ! _ ” “ Oh , your pardon !
I never visit <unk> ; I leave that to the <unk> . ” “ Really , you were only before sparkling , but now you are brilliant ; take compassion on us , or , like <unk> , you will <unk> us up . ” “ I will not speak again , ” said Château-Renaud ; “ pray have compassion upon me , and do not take up every word I say . ” “ Come , let us endeavor to get to the end of our story , Beauchamp ; I told you that yesterday Madame made inquiries of me upon the subject ; <unk> me , and I will then communicate my information to her . ” “ Well , gentlemen , the reason people die so <unk> ( I like the word ) at M. de Villefort ’ s is that there is an assassin in the house ! ” The two young men shuddered , for the same idea had more than once occurred to them .
“ And who is the assassin ; ” they asked together .
“ <unk> Edward ! ” A burst of laughter from the <unk> did not in the least <unk> the <unk> , who continued , — “ Yes , gentlemen ; Edward , the infant <unk> , who is quite an <unk> in the art of <unk> . ” “ You are <unk> . ” “ Not at all .
I yesterday engaged a servant , who had just left M. de Villefort — I intend sending him away tomorrow , for he <unk> so <unk> , to make up for the fast imposed upon him by his terror in that house .
Well , now listen . ” “ We are listening . ” “ It appears the dear child has obtained possession of a bottle containing some <unk> , which he every now and then <unk> against those who have displeased him .
First , M. and Madame de Saint-Méran <unk> his <unk> , so he poured out three drops of his <unk> — three drops were sufficient ; then followed Barrois , the old servant of M. Noirtier , who sometimes <unk> this little wretch — he therefore received the same quantity of the <unk> ; the same happened to Valentine , of whom he was jealous ; he gave her the same <unk> as the others , and all was over for her as well as the rest . ” “ Why , what nonsense are you telling us ? ” said Château-Renaud .
“ Yes , it is an extraordinary story , ” said Beauchamp ; “ is it not ? ” “ It is absurd , ” said Debray .
“ Ah , ” said Beauchamp , “ you doubt me ?
Well , you can ask my servant , or rather him who will no longer be my servant tomorrow , it was the talk of the house . ” “ And this <unk> , where is it ?
what is it ? ” “ The child <unk> it . ” “ But where did he find it ? ” “ In his mother ’ s laboratory . ” “ Does his mother then , keep <unk> in her laboratory ? ” “ How can I tell ?
You are <unk> me like a king ’ s attorney .
I only repeat what I have been told , and like my <unk> I can do no more .
The poor devil would eat nothing , from fear . ” “ It is incredible ! ” “ No , my dear fellow , it is not at all incredible .
You saw the child pass through the Rue <unk> last year , who amused himself with <unk> his brothers and sisters by <unk> <unk> in their ears while they slept .
The <unk> who follow us are very <unk> . ” “ Come , Beauchamp , ” said Château-Renaud , “ I will <unk> anything you do not believe a word of all you have been telling us .
But I do not see the Count of Monte Cristo here . ” “ He is worn out , ” said Debray ; “ besides , he could not well appear in public , since he has been the <unk> of the Cavalcanti , who , it appears , presented themselves to him with false letters of credit , and <unk> him out of <unk> francs upon the <unk> of this <unk> . ” “ By the way , M. de Château-Renaud , ” asked Beauchamp , “ how is Morrel ? ” “ _ Ma foi _ , I have called three times without once seeing him .
Still , his sister did not seem uneasy , and told me that though she had not seen him for two or three days , she was sure he was well . ” “ Ah , now I think of it , the Count of Monte Cristo cannot appear in the hall , ” said Beauchamp .
“ Why not ? ” “ Because he is an <unk> in the drama . ” “ Has he assassinated anyone , then ? ” “ No , on the contrary , they wished to <unk> him .
You know that it was in leaving his house that M. de Caderousse was murdered by his friend Benedetto .
You know that the famous waistcoat was found in his house , containing the letter which stopped the signature of the <unk> .
Do you see the waistcoat ?
There it is , all <unk> , on the desk , as a <unk> of the crime . ” “ Ah , very good . ” “ Hush , gentlemen , here is the court ; let us go back to our places . ” A noise was heard in the hall ; the sergeant called his two <unk> with an energetic “ <unk> ! ” and the <unk> appearing , called out with that <unk> voice peculiar to his order , ever since the days of <unk> : “ The court , gentlemen ! ” Chapter <unk> .
The <unk> The judges took their places in the midst of the most profound silence ; the <unk> took their <unk> ; M. de Villefort , the object of unusual attention , and we had almost said of general admiration , sat in the armchair and cast a tranquil glance around him .
<unk> looked with astonishment on that grave and severe face , whose calm expression personal <unk> had been unable to disturb , and the aspect of a man who was a stranger to all human emotions excited something very like terror .
“ <unk> , ” said the president , “ lead in the accused . ” At these words the public attention became more intense , and all eyes were turned towards the door through which Benedetto was to enter .
The door soon opened and the accused appeared .
The same impression was experienced by all present , and no one was deceived by the expression of his countenance .
His features bore no sign of that deep emotion which <unk> the beating of the heart and <unk> the cheek .
His hands , <unk> placed , one upon his hat , the other in the opening of his white waistcoat , were not at all <unk> ; his eye was calm and even brilliant .
<unk> had he entered the hall when he glanced at the whole body of <unk> and <unk> ; his eye rested longer on the president , and still more so on the king ’ s attorney .
By the side of Andrea was stationed the lawyer who was to conduct his defence , and who had been appointed by the court , for Andrea <unk> to pay any attention to those details , to which he appeared to attach no importance .
The lawyer was a young man with light hair whose face expressed a hundred times more emotion than that which <unk> the prisoner .
<unk> The president called for the <unk> , <unk> as we know , by the clever and <unk> pen of Villefort .
During the reading of this , which was long , the public attention was continually drawn towards Andrea , who bore the <unk> with <unk> <unk> .
Villefort had never been so <unk> and <unk> .
The crime was <unk> in the most <unk> colors ; the former life of the prisoner , his <unk> , a <unk> of his life from the <unk> period , were set forth with all the talent that a knowledge of human life could furnish to a mind like that of the procureur .
Benedetto was thus forever condemned in public opinion before the sentence of the law could be pronounced .
Andrea paid no attention to the <unk> <unk> which were brought against him .
M. de Villefort , who examined him attentively , and who no doubt <unk> upon him all the <unk> studies he was accustomed to use , in vain endeavored to make him lower his eyes , notwithstanding the depth and <unk> of his gaze .
At length the reading of the <unk> was ended .
“ <unk> , ” said the president , “ your name and <unk> ? ” Andrea arose .
“ Excuse me , Mr. President , ” he said , in a clear voice , “ but I see you are going to <unk> a course of questions through which I cannot follow you .
I have an idea , which I will explain by and by , of making an exception to the usual form of accusation .
<unk> me , then , if you please , to answer in different order , or I will not do so at all . ” The astonished president looked at the <unk> , who in turn looked at Villefort .
The whole assembly manifested great surprise , but Andrea appeared quite <unk> .
“ Your age ? ” said the president ; “ will you answer that question ? ” “ I will answer that question , as well as the rest , Mr. President , but in its turn . ” “ Your age ? ” repeated the president .
“ I am <unk> years old , or rather I shall be in a few days , as I was born the night of the <unk> of September , <unk> . ” M. de Villefort , who was busy taking down some notes , raised his head at the mention of this date .
“ Where were you born ? ” continued the president .
“ At Auteuil , near Paris . ” M. de Villefort a second time raised his head , looked at Benedetto as if he had been gazing at the head of <unk> , and became livid .
As for Benedetto , he <unk> wiped his lips with a fine <unk> <unk> .
“ Your profession ? ” “ First I was a <unk> , ” answered Andrea , as calmly as possible ; “ then I became a thief , and lately have become an assassin . ” A murmur , or rather storm , of indignation burst from all parts of the assembly .
The judges themselves appeared to be stupefied , and the <unk> manifested <unk> of disgust for a <unk> so unexpected in a man of fashion .
M. de Villefort pressed his hand upon his brow , which , at first pale , had become red and burning ; then he suddenly arose and looked around as though he had lost his senses — he wanted air .
<unk> “ Are you looking for anything , Mr. <unk> ? ” asked Benedetto , with his most <unk> smile .
M. de Villefort answered nothing , but sat , or rather threw himself down again upon his chair .
“ And now , prisoner , will you consent to tell your name ? ” said the president .
“ The brutal <unk> with which you have <unk> and <unk> your crimes calls for a severe <unk> on the part of the court , both in the name of <unk> , and for the respect due to humanity .
You appear to consider this a point of honor , and it may be for this reason , that you have delayed <unk> your name .
You wished it to be preceded by all these <unk> . ” “ It is quite wonderful , Mr. President , how entirely you have read my thoughts , ” said Benedetto , in his <unk> voice and most <unk> manner .
“ This is , indeed , the reason why I begged you to alter the order of the questions . ” The public astonishment had reached its height .
There was no longer any <unk> or <unk> in the manner of the accused .
The audience felt that a startling <unk> was to follow this <unk> <unk> .
“ Well , ” said the president ; “ your name ? ” “ I cannot tell you my name , since I do not know it ; but I know my father ’ s , and can tell it to you . ” A painful <unk> overwhelmed Villefort ; great drops of <unk> <unk> fell from his face upon the papers which he held in his <unk> hand .
“ <unk> your father ’ s name , ” said the president .
Not a whisper , not a breath , was heard in that vast assembly ; everyone waited anxiously .
“ My father is king ’ s attorney , ” replied Andrea calmly .
<unk> “ King ’ s attorney ? ” said the president , stupefied , and without <unk> the agitation which spread over the face of M. de Villefort ; “ king ’ s attorney ? ” “ Yes ; and if you wish to know his name , I will tell it , — he is named Villefort . ” The <unk> , which had been so long restrained from a feeling of respect to the court of justice , now burst forth like thunder from the <unk> of all present ; the court itself did not seek to restrain the feelings of the audience .
The <unk> , the <unk> addressed to Benedetto , who remained perfectly <unk> , the energetic <unk> , the movement of the gendarmes , the <unk> of the <unk> of the crowd always sure to rise to the surface in case of any <unk> — all this lasted five minutes , before the <unk> and <unk> were able to restore silence .
In the midst of this tumult the voice of the president was heard to <unk> : “ Are you playing with justice , accused , and do you dare set your <unk> an example of disorder which even in these times has never been <unk> ? ” <unk> persons hurried up to M. de Villefort , who sat half bowed over in his chair , offering him consolation , encouragement , and <unk> of <unk> and sympathy .
<unk> was <unk> in the hall , except that a few people still moved about and whispered to one another .
A lady , it was said , had just fainted ; they had supplied her with a <unk> , and she had recovered .
During the scene of tumult , Andrea had turned his smiling face towards the assembly ; then , leaning with one hand on the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> , in the most graceful attitude possible , he said : “ Gentlemen , I assure you I had no idea of <unk> the court , or of making a useless <unk> in the presence of this honorable assembly .
They ask my age ; I tell it .
They ask where I was born ; I answer .
They ask my name , I cannot give it , since my parents abandoned me .
But though I cannot give my own name , not <unk> one , I can tell them my father ’ s .
Now I repeat , my father is named M. de Villefort , and I am ready to prove it . ” There was an energy , a conviction , and a sincerity in the manner of the young man , which <unk> the tumult .
All eyes were turned for a moment towards the procureur , who sat as motionless as though a <unk> had changed him into a corpse .
“ Gentlemen , ” said Andrea , <unk> silence by his voice and manner ; “ I owe you the proofs and <unk> of what I have said . ” “ But , ” said the irritated president , “ you called yourself Benedetto , declared yourself an <unk> , and <unk> Corsica as your country . ” “ I said anything I pleased , in order that the solemn declaration I have just made should not be <unk> , which otherwise would certainly have been the case .
I now repeat that I was born at Auteuil on the night of the <unk> of September , <unk> , and that I am the son of the procureur , M. de Villefort .
Do you wish for any further details ?
I will give them .
I was born in No .
<unk> , Rue de la <unk> , in a room hung with red damask ; my father took me in his arms , telling my mother I was dead , wrapped me in a <unk> marked with an <unk> and an <unk> , and carried me into a garden , where he buried me alive . ” A shudder ran through the assembly when they saw that the confidence of the prisoner increased in proportion to the terror of M. de Villefort .
“ But how have you become acquainted with all these details ? ” asked the president .
“ I will tell you , Mr. President .
A man who had <unk> vengeance against my father , and had long watched his opportunity to kill him , had introduced himself that night into the garden in which my father buried me .
He was concealed in a thicket ; he saw my father <unk> something in the ground , and <unk> him ; then thinking the <unk> might contain some treasure he turned up the ground , and found me still living .
The man carried me to the <unk> asylum , where I was <unk> under the number <unk> .
Three months afterwards , a woman travelled from <unk> to Paris to fetch me , and having <unk> me as her son , carried me away .
Thus , you see , though born in Paris , I was brought up in Corsica . ” There was a moment ’ s silence , during which one could have fancied the hall empty , so profound was the <unk> .
“ <unk> , ” said the president .
“ Certainly , I might have lived happily amongst those good people , who adored me , but my <unk> disposition prevailed over the virtues which my adopted mother endeavored to <unk> into my heart .
I increased in <unk> till I committed crime .
One day when I cursed Providence for making me so wicked , and <unk> me to such a fate , my adopted father said to me , ‘ Do not <unk> , unhappy child , the crime is that of your father , not yours , — of your father , who <unk> you to hell if you died , and to misery if a miracle preserved you alive . ’ After that I ceased to <unk> , but I cursed my father .
That is why I have uttered the words for which you blame me ; that is why I have filled this whole assembly with horror .
If I have committed an additional crime , <unk> me , but if you will allow that ever since the day of my birth my fate has been sad , bitter , and <unk> , then pity me . ” “ But your mother ? ” asked the president .
“ My mother thought me dead ; she is not guilty .
I did not even wish to know her name , nor do I know it . ” Just then a piercing cry , <unk> in a sob , burst from the centre of the crowd , who <unk> the lady who had before fainted , and who now fell into a violent fit of <unk> .
She was carried out of the hall , the thick veil which concealed her face dropped off , and Madame Danglars was recognized .
<unk> his <unk> nerves , the <unk> sensation in his ears , and the madness which turned his brain , Villefort rose as he perceived her .
“ The proofs , the proofs ! ” said the president ; “ remember this <unk> of horrors must be supported by the <unk> proofs . ” “ The proofs ? ” said Benedetto , laughing ; “ do you want proofs ? ” “ Yes . ” “ Well , then , look at M. de Villefort , and then ask me for proofs . ” <unk> turned towards the procureur , who , unable to bear the universal gaze now <unk> on him alone , advanced <unk> into the midst of the <unk> , with his hair <unk> and his face <unk> with the mark of his nails .
The whole assembly uttered a long murmur of astonishment .
“ Father , ” said Benedetto , “ I am asked for proofs , do you wish me to give them ? ” “ No , no , it is useless , ” stammered M. de Villefort in a hoarse voice ; “ no , it is useless ! ” “ How useless ? ” cried the president , “ what do you mean ? ” “ I mean that I feel it impossible to struggle against this deadly weight which <unk> me .
Gentlemen , I know I am in the hands of an <unk> God !
We need no proofs ; everything relating to this young man is true . ” A dull , gloomy silence , like that which <unk> some awful <unk> of nature , <unk> the assembly , who shuddered in <unk> .
“ What , M. de Villefort , ” cried the president , “ do you yield to an <unk> ?
What , are you no longer in possession of your senses ?
This strange , unexpected , terrible accusation has <unk> your reason .
Come , recover . ” The procureur dropped his head ; his teeth <unk> like those of a man under a violent attack of fever , and yet he was deadly pale .
“ I am in possession of all my senses , sir , ” he said ; “ my body alone <unk> , as you may suppose .
I acknowledge myself guilty of all the young man has brought against me , and from this hour hold myself under the authority of the procureur who will succeed me . ” And as he spoke these words with a hoarse , <unk> voice , he <unk> towards the door , which was mechanically opened by a <unk> .
The whole assembly were <unk> with astonishment at the <unk> and confession which had produced a catastrophe so different from that which had been expected during the last fortnight by the Parisian world .
“ Well , ” said Beauchamp , “ let them now say that drama is <unk> ! ” “ _ Ma foi ! _ ” said Château-Renaud , “ I would rather end my career like M. de Morcerf ; a <unk> seems quite delightful compared with this catastrophe . ” “ And moreover , it <unk> , ” said Beauchamp .
“ And to think that I had an idea of marrying his daughter , ” said Debray .
“ She did well to die , poor girl ! ” “ The sitting is <unk> , gentlemen , ” said the president ; “ fresh inquiries will be made , and the case will be tried next <unk> by another magistrate . ” As for Andrea , who was calm and more interesting than ever , he left the hall , <unk> by gendarmes , who <unk> paid him some attention .
“ Well , what do you think of this , my fine fellow ? ” asked Debray of the <unk> , <unk> a louis into his hand .
“ There will be <unk> circumstances , ” he replied .
Chapter <unk> .
<unk> <unk> the <unk> of the crowd , M. de Villefort saw it open before him .
There is something so <unk> in great <unk> that even in the worst times the first emotion of a crowd has generally been to <unk> with the <unk> in a great catastrophe .
Many people have been assassinated in a tumult , but even <unk> have rarely been <unk> during trial .
Thus Villefort passed through the mass of spectators and officers of the <unk> , and withdrew .
Though he had acknowledged his guilt , he was protected by his grief .
There are some <unk> which men understand by instinct , but which reason is <unk> to explain ; in such cases the greatest poet is he who gives utterance to the most natural and <unk> <unk> of sorrow .
Those who hear the bitter cry are as much impressed as if they listened to an entire <unk> , and when the <unk> is sincere they are right in regarding his <unk> as sublime .
It would be difficult to describe the state of <unk> in which Villefort left the <unk> .
Every pulse beat with feverish excitement , every <unk> was <unk> , every <unk> <unk> , and every part of his body seemed to suffer distinctly from the rest , thus <unk> his agony a <unk> .
He made his way along the <unk> through force of habit ; he threw aside his <unk> <unk> , not out of <unk> to <unk> , but because it was an <unk> burden , a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , <unk> in torture .
Having <unk> as far as the Rue <unk> , he perceived his carriage , awoke his sleeping coachman by opening the door himself , threw himself on the <unk> , and pointed towards the Faubourg <unk> ; the carriage drove on .
All the weight of his fallen fortune seemed suddenly to crush him ; he could not <unk> the <unk> ; he could not <unk> the future with the indifference of the <unk> criminal who merely faces a <unk> already familiar .
God was still in his heart .
“ God , ” he murmured , not knowing what he said , — “ God — God ! ” Behind the event that had overwhelmed him he saw the hand of God .
The carriage rolled rapidly <unk> .
Villefort , while turning <unk> on the <unk> , felt something press against him .
He put out his hand to remove the object ; it was a <unk> which Madame de Villefort had left in the carriage ; this <unk> awakened a recollection which darted through his mind like lightning .
He thought of his wife .
<unk> “ Oh ! ” he exclaimed , as though a <unk> iron were piercing his heart .
During the last hour his own crime had alone been presented to his mind ; now another object , not less terrible , suddenly presented itself .
His wife !
He had just acted the <unk> judge with her , he had condemned her to death , and she , crushed by remorse , struck with terror , covered with the shame inspired by the <unk> of _ his _ <unk> virtue , — she , a poor , weak woman , without help or the power of <unk> herself against his absolute and supreme will , — she might at that very moment , perhaps , be preparing to die !
An hour had elapsed since her <unk> ; at that moment , doubtless , she was <unk> all her crimes to her memory ; she was asking pardon for her sins ; perhaps she was even writing a letter <unk> <unk> from her <unk> husband — a <unk> she was <unk> with her death !
Villefort again <unk> with anguish and despair .
“ Ah , ” he exclaimed , “ that woman became criminal only from <unk> with me !
I carried the <unk> of crime with me , and she has caught it as she would the <unk> fever , the <unk> , the <unk> !
And yet I have punished her — I have dared to tell her — _ I _ have — ‘ <unk> and die ! ’ But no , she must not die ; she shall live , and with me .
We will <unk> from Paris and go as far as the earth <unk> .
I told her of the scaffold ; oh , <unk> , I forgot that it <unk> me also !
How could I pronounce that word ?
Yes , we will fly ; I will confess all to her , — I will tell her daily that I also have committed a crime ! — Oh , what an alliance — the tiger and the <unk> ; worthy wife of such as I am !
She _ must _ live that my <unk> may <unk> hers . ” And Villefort dashed open the window in front of the carriage .
“ <unk> , <unk> ! ” he cried , in a tone which <unk> the coachman .
The horses , <unk> by fear , flew towards the house .
“ Yes , yes , ” repeated Villefort , as he approached his home — “ yes , that woman must live ; she must <unk> , and <unk> my son , the sole <unk> , with the exception of the <unk> old man , of the <unk> of my house .
She loves him ; it was for his sake she has committed these crimes .
We ought never to despair of <unk> the heart of a mother who loves her child .
She will <unk> , and no one will know that she has been guilty .
The events which have taken place in my house , though they now occupy the public mind , will be forgotten in time , or if , indeed , a few enemies should <unk> in <unk> them , why then I will add them to my list of crimes .
What will it signify if one , two , or three more are added ?
My wife and child shall escape from this gulf , carrying treasures with them ; she will live and may yet be happy , since her child , in whom all her love is <unk> , will be with her .
I shall have performed a good action , and my heart will be <unk> . ” And the procureur breathed more freely than he had done for some time .
<unk> The carriage stopped at the door of the house .
Villefort leaped out of the carriage , and saw that his servants were surprised at his early return ; he could read no other expression on their features .
Neither of them spoke to him ; they merely stood aside to let him pass by , as usual , nothing more .
As he passed by M. Noirtier ’ s room , he perceived two figures through the <unk> door ; but he experienced no curiosity to know who was visiting his father ; anxiety carried him on further .
“ Come , ” he said , as he ascended the stairs leading to his wife ’ s room , “ nothing is changed here . ” He then closed the door of the landing .
“ No one must disturb us , ” he said ; “ I must speak freely to her , <unk> myself , and say ” — he approached the door , touched the <unk> handle , which yielded to his hand .
“ Not locked , ” he cried ; “ that is well . ” And he entered the little room in which Edward slept ; for though the child went to school during the day , his mother could not allow him to be separated from her at night .
With a single glance Villefort ’ s eye ran through the room .
“ Not here , ” he said ; “ doubtless she is in her bedroom . ” He rushed towards the door , found it <unk> , and stopped , shuddering .
“ <unk> ! ” he cried .
He fancied he heard the sound of a piece of furniture being removed .
“ <unk> ! ” he repeated .
“ Who is there ? ” answered the voice of her he sought .
He thought that voice more feeble than usual .
“ <unk> the door ! ” cried Villefort .
“ <unk> ; it is I. ” But notwithstanding this request , notwithstanding the tone of anguish in which it was uttered , the door remained closed .
Villefort burst it open with a violent blow .
At the entrance of the room which led to her <unk> , Madame de Villefort was standing erect , pale , her features contracted , and her eyes <unk> horribly .
“ <unk> , <unk> ! ” he said , “ what is the matter ?
Speak ! ” The young woman extended her stiff white hands towards him .
“ It is done , monsieur , ” she said with a <unk> noise which seemed to tear her throat .
“ What more do you want ? ” and she fell full length on the floor .
Villefort ran to her and seized her hand , which convulsively clasped a <unk> bottle with a golden <unk> .
Madame de Villefort was dead .
Villefort , <unk> with horror , stepped back to the <unk> of the door , fixing his eyes on the corpse .
“ My son ! ” he exclaimed suddenly , “ where is my son ? — Edward , Edward ! ” and he rushed out of the room , still crying , “ Edward , Edward ! ” The name was pronounced in such a tone of anguish that the servants ran up .
“ Where is my son ? ” asked Villefort ; “ let him be removed from the house , that he may not see — — ” “ Master Edward is not downstairs , sir , ” replied the valet .
“ Then he must be playing in the garden ; go and see . ” <unk> “ No , sir ; Madame de Villefort sent for him half an hour ago ; he went into her room , and has not been downstairs since . ” A cold perspiration burst out on Villefort ’ s brow ; his legs trembled , and his thoughts flew about <unk> in his brain like the wheels of a <unk> watch .
“ In Madame de Villefort ’ s room ? ” he murmured and slowly returned , with one hand <unk> his forehead , and with the other <unk> himself against the wall .
To enter the room he must again see the body of his unfortunate wife .
To call Edward he must <unk> the <unk> of that room which now appeared like a sepulchre ; to speak seemed like <unk> the silence of the tomb .
His tongue was <unk> in his mouth .
“ Edward ! ” he stammered — “ Edward ! ” The child did not answer .
Where , then , could he be , if he had entered his mother ’ s room and not since returned ?
He stepped forward .
The corpse of Madame de Villefort was stretched across the <unk> leading to the room in which Edward must be ; those <unk> eyes seemed to watch over the threshold , and the lips bore the <unk> of a terrible and mysterious <unk> .
Through the open door was visible a portion of the <unk> , containing an upright <unk> and a blue satin <unk> .
Villefort stepped forward two or three paces , and beheld his child lying — no doubt asleep — on the sofa .
The unhappy man uttered an exclamation of joy ; a ray of light seemed to penetrate the abyss of despair and darkness .
He had only to step over the corpse , enter the <unk> , take the child in his arms , and <unk> far , far away .
Villefort was no longer the <unk> man ; he was a tiger hurt <unk> death , <unk> his teeth in his wound .
He no longer feared realities , but <unk> .
He leaped over the corpse as if it had been a burning brazier .
He took the child in his arms , embraced him , shook him , called him , but the child made no <unk> .
He pressed his burning lips to the cheeks , but they were <unk> cold and pale ; he felt the <unk> limbs ; he pressed his hand upon the heart , but it no longer beat , — the child was dead .
A folded paper fell from Edward ’ s breast .
Villefort , <unk> , fell upon his knees ; the child dropped from his arms , and rolled on the floor by the side of its mother .
He picked up the paper , and , <unk> his wife ’ s writing , ran his eyes rapidly over its contents ; it ran as follows : “ You know that I was a good mother , since it was for my son ’ s sake I became criminal .
A good mother cannot depart without her son . ” Villefort could not believe his eyes , — he could not believe his reason ; he dragged himself towards the child ’ s body , and examined it as a <unk> <unk> its dead <unk> .
Then a piercing cry escaped from his breast , and he cried , “ Still the hand of God . ” The presence of the two <unk> alarmed him ; he could not bear solitude shared only by two corpses .
<unk> then he had been sustained by rage , by his strength of mind , by despair , by the supreme agony which led the <unk> to scale the heavens , and <unk> to <unk> the <unk> .
He now arose , his head bowed beneath the weight of grief , and , shaking his damp , <unk> hair , he who had never felt compassion for anyone determined to seek his father , that he might have someone to whom he could relate his misfortunes , — someone by whose side he might weep .
<unk> He descended the little staircase with which we are acquainted , and entered Noirtier ’ s room .
The old man appeared to be listening attentively and as <unk> as his <unk> would allow to the Abbé Busoni , who looked cold and calm , as usual .
Villefort , perceiving the abbé , passed his hand across his brow .
The past came to him like one of those waves whose wrath <unk> <unk> than the others .
He recollected the call he had made upon him after the dinner at Auteuil , and then the visit the abbé had himself paid to his house on the day of Valentine ’ s death .
“ You here , sir ! ” he exclaimed ; “ do you , then , never appear but to act as an <unk> to death ? ” Busoni turned around , and , perceiving the excitement <unk> on the magistrate ’ s face , the savage <unk> of his eyes , he understood that the <unk> had been made at the <unk> ; but beyond this he was ignorant .
“ I came to pray over the body of your daughter . ” “ And now why are you here ? ” “ I come to tell you that you have sufficiently <unk> your debt , and that from this moment I will pray to God to forgive you , as I do . ” “ Good heavens ! ” exclaimed Villefort , <unk> back <unk> , “ surely that is not the voice of the Abbé Busoni ! ” “ No ! ” The abbé threw off his <unk> , shook his head , and his hair , no longer confined , fell in black masses around his <unk> face .
“ It is the face of the Count of Monte Cristo ! ” exclaimed the procureur , with a haggard expression .
“ You are not exactly right , M. <unk> ; you must go farther back . ” “ That voice , that voice ! — where did I first hear it ? ” “ You heard it for the first time at Marseilles , <unk> years ago , the day of your marriage with Mademoiselle de Saint-Méran .
<unk> to your papers . ” “ You are not Busoni ? — you are not Monte Cristo ?
Oh , heavens !
you are , then , some secret , <unk> , and mortal enemy !
I must have <unk> you in some way at Marseilles .
Oh , <unk> to me ! ” “ Yes ; you are now on the right path , ” said the count , crossing his arms over his broad chest ; “ search — search ! ” “ But what have I done to you ? ” exclaimed Villefort , whose mind was <unk> between reason and <unk> , in that cloud which is neither a dream nor reality ; “ what have I done to you ?
Tell me , then !
Speak ! ” “ You condemned me to a horrible , <unk> death ; you killed my father ; you deprived me of liberty , of love , and happiness . ” “ Who are you , then ?
Who are you ? ” “ I am the spectre of a wretch you buried in the <unk> of the Château d ’ If .
God gave that spectre the form of the Count of Monte Cristo when he at length <unk> from his tomb , <unk> him with gold and diamonds , and led him to you ! ” “ Ah , I recognize you — I recognize you ! ” exclaimed the king ’ s attorney ; “ you are — — ” “ I am Edmond Dantès ! ” “ You are Edmond Dantès , ” cried Villefort , seizing the count by the <unk> ; “ then come here ! ” And up the stairs he dragged Monte Cristo ; who , ignorant of what had happened , followed him in astonishment , <unk> some new catastrophe .
“ There , Edmond Dantès ! ” he said , pointing to the bodies of his wife and child , “ see , are you well <unk> ? ” Monte Cristo became pale at this horrible sight ; he felt that he had passed beyond the bounds of vengeance , and that he could no longer say , “ God is for and with me . ” With an expression of indescribable anguish he threw himself upon the body of the child , <unk> its eyes , felt its pulse , and then rushed with him into Valentine ’ s room , of which he <unk> the door .
“ My child , ” cried Villefort , “ he <unk> away the body of my child !
Oh , <unk> , <unk> , death to you ! ” He tried to follow Monte Cristo ; but as though in a dream he was <unk> to the spot , — his eyes <unk> as though they were starting through the <unk> ; he <unk> the flesh on his chest until his nails were <unk> with blood ; the veins of his <unk> <unk> and <unk> as though they would burst their narrow <unk> , and <unk> his brain with living fire .
This lasted several minutes , until the frightful <unk> of reason was accomplished ; then uttering a loud cry followed by a burst of laughter , he rushed down the stairs .
A quarter of an hour afterwards the door of Valentine ’ s room opened , and Monte Cristo reappeared .
<unk> , with a dull eye and heavy heart , all the noble features of that face , usually so calm and serene , were <unk> by grief .
In his arms he held the child , whom no skill had been able to recall to life .
<unk> on one knee , he placed it <unk> by the side of its mother , with its head upon her breast .
Then , rising , he went out , and meeting a servant on the stairs , he asked : “ Where is M. de Villefort ? ” The servant , instead of answering , pointed to the garden .
Monte Cristo ran down the steps , and advancing towards the spot designated beheld Villefort , <unk> by his servants , with a <unk> in his hand , and <unk> the earth with fury .
“ It is not here ! ” he cried .
“ It is not here ! ” <unk> And then he moved farther on , and began again to <unk> .
Monte Cristo approached him , and said in a low voice , with an expression almost humble : “ Sir , you have indeed lost a son ; but — — ” Villefort interrupted him ; he had neither listened nor heard .
“ Oh , I _ will _ find it , ” he cried ; “ you may pretend he is not here , but I _ will _ find him , though I <unk> forever ! ” Monte Cristo drew back in horror .
“ Oh , ” he said , “ he is mad ! ” And as though he feared that the walls of the <unk> house would <unk> around him , he rushed into the street , for the first time <unk> whether he had the right to do as he had done .
“ Oh , enough of this , — enough of this , ” he cried ; “ let me save the last . ” On entering his house , he met Morrel , who wandered about like a <unk> awaiting the <unk> <unk> for return to the tomb .
“ <unk> yourself , Maximilian , ” he said with a smile ; “ we leave Paris tomorrow . ” “ Have you nothing more to do there ? ” asked Morrel .
“ No , ” replied Monte Cristo ; “ God grant I may not have done too much already . ” The next day they indeed left , accompanied only by Baptistin .
Haydée had taken away Ali , and Bertuccio remained with Noirtier .
Chapter <unk> .
The <unk> The recent events formed the <unk> of conversation throughout all Paris .
Emmanuel and his wife <unk> with natural astonishment in their little apartment in the Rue <unk> upon the three <unk> , sudden , and most unexpected <unk> of Morcerf , Danglars , and Villefort .
Maximilian , who was paying them a visit , listened to their conversation , or rather was present at it , plunged in his accustomed state of <unk> .
“ Indeed , ” said Julie , “ might we not almost fancy , Emmanuel , that those people , so rich , so happy but yesterday , had forgotten in their prosperity that an evil genius — like the wicked <unk> in <unk> ’ s stories who present themselves <unk> at a wedding or <unk> — <unk> over them , and appeared all at once to revenge himself for their fatal neglect ? ” “ What a <unk> misfortune ! ” said Emmanuel , thinking of Morcerf and Danglars .
“ What dreadful sufferings ! ” said Julie , <unk> Valentine , but whom , with a delicacy natural to women , she did not name before her brother .
“ If the <unk> <unk> has directed the fatal blow , ” said Emmanuel , “ it must be that he in his great goodness has perceived nothing in the past lives of these people to merit <unk> of their awful punishment . ” “ Do you not form a very <unk> judgment , Emmanuel ? ” said Julie .
“ When my father , with a pistol in his hand , was once on the point of <unk> suicide , had anyone then said , ‘ This man <unk> his misery , ’ would not that person have been deceived ? ” “ Yes ; but your father was not allowed to fall .
A being was <unk> to arrest the fatal hand of death about to descend on him . ” Emmanuel had scarcely uttered these words when the sound of the bell was heard , the <unk> signal given by the porter that a visitor had arrived .
Nearly at the same instant the door was opened and the Count of Monte Cristo appeared on the threshold .
The young people uttered a cry of joy , while Maximilian raised his head , but let it fall again immediately .
<unk> “ Maximilian , ” said the count , without appearing to notice the different <unk> which his presence produced on the little circle , “ I come to seek you . ” “ To seek me ? ” repeated Morrel , as if <unk> from a dream .
“ Yes , ” said Monte Cristo ; “ has it not been agreed that I should take you with me , and did I not tell you yesterday to prepare for departure ? ” “ I am ready , ” said Maximilian ; “ I came <unk> to wish them farewell . ” “ <unk> are you going , count ? ” asked Julie .
“ In the first instance to Marseilles , madame . ” “ To Marseilles ! ” exclaimed the young couple .
“ Yes , and I take your brother with me . ” “ Oh , count . ” said Julie , “ will you restore him to us <unk> of his melancholy ? ” Morrel turned away to conceal the confusion of his countenance .
“ You perceive , then , that he is not happy ? ” said the count .
“ Yes , ” replied the young woman ; “ and fear much that he finds our home but a dull one . ” “ I will <unk> to <unk> him , ” replied the count .
“ I am ready to accompany you , sir , ” said Maximilian .
“ Adieu , my kind friends !
Emmanuel — Julie — farewell ! ” “ How farewell ? ” exclaimed Julie ; “ do you leave us thus , so suddenly , without any <unk> for your journey , without even a passport ? ” “ <unk> <unk> but increase the grief of parting , ” said Monte Cristo , “ and Maximilian has doubtless provided himself with everything requisite ; at least , I <unk> him to do so . ” “ I have a passport , and my clothes are ready <unk> , ” said Morrel in his tranquil but mournful manner .
“ Good , ” said Monte Cristo , smiling ; “ in these <unk> arrangements we recognize the order of a <unk> soldier . ” “ And you leave us , ” said Julie , “ at a moment ’ s warning ?
you do not give us a day — no , not even an hour before your departure ? ” “ My carriage is at the door , madame , and I must be in Rome in five days . ” “ But does Maximilian go to Rome ? ” exclaimed Emmanuel .
“ I am going wherever it may please the count to take me , ” said Morrel , with a smile full of grief ; “ I am under his orders for the next month . ” “ Oh , heavens , how strangely he <unk> himself , count ! ” said Julie .
“ Maximilian goes with _ me _ , ” said the count , in his <unk> and most <unk> manner ; “ therefore do not make yourself uneasy on your brother ’ s account . ” “ Once more farewell , my dear sister ; Emmanuel , adieu ! ” Morrel repeated .
“ His <unk> and indifference touch me to the heart , ” said Julie .
“ Oh , Maximilian , Maximilian , you are certainly <unk> something from us . ” “ <unk> ! ” said Monte Cristo , “ you will see him return to you gay , smiling , and <unk> . ” Maximilian cast a look of disdain , almost of anger , on the count .
“ We must leave you , ” said Monte Cristo .
<unk> “ Before you quit us , count , ” said Julie , “ will you permit us to express to you all that the other day — — ” “ Madame , ” interrupted the count , taking her two hands in his , “ all that you could say in words would never express what I read in your eyes ; the thoughts of your heart are fully understood by mine .
Like <unk> in <unk> , I should have left you without seeing you again , but that would have been a virtue beyond my strength , because I am a weak and vain man , fond of the tender , kind , and <unk> glances of my <unk> .
On the <unk> of departure I carry my <unk> so far as to say , ‘ Do not forget me , my kind friends , for probably you will never see me again . ’ ” “ Never see you again ? ” exclaimed Emmanuel , while two large tears rolled down Julie ’ s cheeks , “ never behold you again ?
It is not a man , then , but some angel that leaves us , and this angel is on the point of returning to heaven after having appeared on earth to do good . ” “ Say not so , ” quickly returned Monte Cristo — “ say not so , my friends ; angels never <unk> , celestial beings remain where they wish to be .
<unk> is not more powerful than they ; it is they who , on the contrary , overcome fate .
No , Emmanuel , I am but a man , and your admiration is as <unk> as your words are <unk> . ” And pressing his lips on the hand of Julie , who rushed into his arms , he extended his other hand to Emmanuel ; then tearing himself from this abode of peace and happiness , he made a sign to Maximilian , who followed him <unk> , with the indifference which had been <unk> in him ever since the death of Valentine had so <unk> him .
“ <unk> my brother to peace and happiness , ” whispered Julie to Monte Cristo .
And the count pressed her hand in reply , as he had done eleven years before on the staircase leading to Morrel ’ s study .
“ You still <unk> , then , in Sinbad the <unk> ? ” asked he , smiling .
“ Oh , yes , ” was the ready answer .
“ Well , then , sleep in peace , and put your trust in the Lord . ” As we have before said , the <unk> was waiting ; four powerful horses were already <unk> the ground with impatience , while Ali , apparently just arrived from a long walk , was standing at the foot of the steps , his face bathed in perspiration .
“ Well , ” asked the count in <unk> , “ have you been to see the old man ? ” Ali made a sign in the <unk> .
“ And have you placed the letter before him , as I ordered you to do ? ” The slave <unk> <unk> that he had .
“ And what did he say , or rather do ? ” Ali placed himself in the light , so that his master might see him distinctly , and then <unk> in his intelligent manner the countenance of the old man , he closed his eyes , as Noirtier was in the custom of doing when saying “ Yes . ” “ Good ; he <unk> , ” said Monte Cristo .
“ Now let us go . ” <unk> These words had scarcely escaped him , when the carriage was on its way , and the feet of the horses struck a <unk> of <unk> from the pavement .
Maximilian settled himself in his corner without uttering a word .
Half an hour had passed when the carriage stopped suddenly ; the count had just pulled the <unk> <unk> , which was fastened to Ali ’ s finger .
The <unk> immediately descended and opened the carriage door .
It was a lovely <unk> night — they had just reached the top of the hill <unk> , from whence Paris appears like a sombre sea <unk> its millions of <unk> waves into light — waves indeed more <unk> , more <unk> , more <unk> , more furious , more <unk> , than those of the <unk> ocean , — waves which never rest as those of the sea sometimes do , — waves ever <unk> , ever <unk> , ever <unk> what falls within their grasp .
The count stood alone , and at a sign from his hand , the carriage went on for a short distance .
With folded arms , he gazed for some time upon the great city .
When he had fixed his piercing look on this modern <unk> , which equally <unk> the contemplation of the religious <unk> , the <unk> , and the <unk> , — “ Great city , ” murmured he , <unk> his head , and <unk> his hands as if in prayer , “ less than six months have elapsed since first I entered thy gates .
I believe that the <unk> of God led my steps to thee and that he also <unk> me to quit thee in triumph ; the secret cause of my presence within thy walls I have <unk> alone to him who only has had the power to read my heart .
God only knows that I retire from thee without pride or hatred , but not without many <unk> ; he only knows that the power <unk> to me has never been made <unk> to my personal good or to any useless cause .
Oh , great city , it is in thy <unk> bosom that I have found that which I sought ; like a patient <unk> , I have dug deep into thy very <unk> to <unk> out evil thence .
Now my work is accomplished , my mission is <unk> , now thou <unk> neither afford me pain nor pleasure .
Adieu , Paris , adieu ! ” His look wandered over the vast plain like that of some genius of the night ; he passed his hand over his brow , got into the carriage , the door was closed on him , and the vehicle quickly disappeared down the other side of the hill in a <unk> of dust and noise .
Ten leagues were passed and not a single word was uttered .
Morrel was dreaming , and Monte Cristo was looking at the <unk> .
“ Morrel , ” said the count to him at length , “ do you <unk> having followed me ? ” “ No , count ; but to leave Paris — — ” “ If I thought happiness might await you in Paris , Morrel , I would have left you there . ” “ Valentine <unk> within the walls of Paris , and to leave Paris is like losing her a second time . ” “ Maximilian , ” said the count , “ the friends that we have lost do not repose in the bosom of the earth , but are buried deep in our hearts , and it has been thus <unk> that we may always be accompanied by them .
I have two friends , who in this way never depart from me ; the one who gave me being , and the other who <unk> knowledge and intelligence on me .
Their spirits live in me .
I consult them when doubtful , and if I ever do any good , it is due to their <unk> <unk> .
Listen to the voice of your heart , Morrel , and ask it whether you ought to preserve this melancholy <unk> towards me . ” “ My friend , ” said Maximilian , “ the voice of my heart is very sorrowful , and promises me nothing but misfortune . ” “ It is the way of <unk> minds to see everything through a black cloud .
The soul forms its own <unk> ; your soul is <unk> , and consequently the sky of the future appears stormy and <unk> . ” “ That may possibly be true , ” said Maximilian , and he again <unk> into his thoughtful <unk> .
The journey was performed with that marvellous rapidity which the <unk> power of the count ever commanded .
<unk> fled from them like shadows on their path , and trees shaken by the first <unk> of autumn seemed like <unk> <unk> rushing on to meet them , and retreating as rapidly when once reached .
The following morning they arrived at <unk> , where the count ’ s <unk> waited for them .
Without the loss of an instant , the carriage was placed on board and the two travellers <unk> without delay .
The boat was built for speed ; her two <unk> were like two wings with which she <unk> the water like a bird .
Morrel was not <unk> to that sensation of delight which is generally experienced in passing rapidly through the air , and the wind which occasionally raised the hair from his forehead seemed on the point of <unk> <unk> the clouds collected there .
As the distance increased between the travellers and Paris , almost <unk> serenity appeared to <unk> the count ; he might have been taken for an <unk> about to <unk> his native land .
<unk> long Marseilles presented herself to view , — Marseilles , white , <unk> , full of life and energy , — Marseilles , the younger sister of <unk> and <unk> , the <unk> to them in the <unk> of the <unk> , — Marseilles , old , yet always young .
<unk> memories were stirred within them by the sight of the round tower , <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> by <unk> , <unk> the port with its <unk> <unk> , where they had both played in childhood , and it was with one accord that they stopped on the <unk> .
A vessel was setting sail for <unk> , on board of which the <unk> usually attending departure prevailed .
The <unk> and their relations <unk> on the deck , friends taking a tender but sorrowful leave of each other , some weeping , others <unk> in their grief , the whole forming a spectacle that might be <unk> even to those who witnessed similar <unk> daily , but which had no power to disturb the current of thought that had taken possession of the mind of Maximilian from the moment he had set foot on the broad pavement of the quay .
“ Here , ” said he , leaning heavily on the arm of Monte Cristo , — “ here is the spot where my father stopped , when the _ Pharaon _ entered the port ; it was here that the good old man , whom you saved from death and <unk> , threw himself into my arms .
I yet feel his warm tears on my face , and his were not the only tears shed , for many who witnessed our meeting wept also . ” Monte Cristo gently smiled and said , — “ I was there ; ” at the same time pointing to the corner of a street .
As he spoke , and in the very direction he indicated , a groan , expressive of bitter grief , was heard , and a woman was seen <unk> her hand to a <unk> on board the vessel about to sail .
Monte Cristo looked at her with an emotion that must have been remarked by Morrel had not his eyes been fixed on the vessel .
“ Oh , heavens ! ” exclaimed Morrel , “ I do not deceive myself — that young man who is <unk> his hat , that youth in the uniform of a <unk> , is Albert de Morcerf ! ” “ Yes , ” said Monte Cristo , “ I recognized him . ” “ How so ? — you were looking the other way . ” <unk> The count smiled , as he was in the habit of doing when he did not want to make any reply , and he again turned towards the veiled woman , who soon disappeared at the corner of the street .
<unk> to his friend : “ Dear Maximilian , ” said the count , “ have you nothing to do in this land ? ” “ I have to weep over the grave of my father , ” replied Morrel in a broken voice .
“ Well , then , go , — wait for me there , and I will soon join you . ” “ You leave me , then ? ” “ Yes ; I also have a <unk> visit to pay . ” Morrel allowed his hand to fall into that which the count extended to him ; then with an <unk> sorrowful inclination of the head he quitted the count and bent his steps to the <unk> of the city .
Monte Cristo remained on the same spot until Maximilian was out of sight ; he then walked slowly towards the <unk> de <unk> to seek out a small house with which our <unk> were made familiar at the beginning of this story .
It yet stood , under the shade of the fine <unk> of <unk> , which forms one of the most frequent walks of the <unk> of Marseilles , covered by an immense <unk> , which <unk> its aged and <unk> branches over the stone front , burnt yellow by the ardent sun of the south .
Two stone steps worn away by the <unk> of many feet led to the door , which was made of three planks ; the door had never been painted or <unk> , so great <unk> <unk> in it during the dry season to close again when the <unk> came on .
The house , with all its <unk> <unk> and apparent misery , was yet cheerful and picturesque , and was the same that old Dantès formerly inhabited — the only difference being that the old man occupied merely the garret , while the whole house was now placed at the command of Mercédès by the count .
The woman whom the count had seen leave the ship with so much regret entered this house ; she had scarcely closed the door after her when Monte Cristo appeared at the corner of a street , so that he found and lost her again almost at the same instant .
The worn out steps were old <unk> of his ; he knew better than anyone else how to open that <unk> door with the large <unk> nail which served to raise the <unk> within .
He entered without <unk> , or giving any other <unk> of his presence , as if he had been a friend or the master of the place .
At the end of a passage <unk> with <unk> , was a little garden , bathed in sunshine , and rich in warmth and light .
In this garden Mercédès had found , at the place indicated by the count , the sum of money which he , through a sense of delicacy , had described as having been placed there <unk> years previously .
The trees of the garden were easily seen from the steps of the <unk> .
Monte Cristo , on <unk> into the house , heard a sigh that was almost a deep sob ; he looked in the direction whence it came , and there under an <unk> of <unk> <unk> , <unk> with its thick <unk> and beautiful long purple flowers , he saw Mercédès seated , with her head bowed , and weeping bitterly .
She had raised her veil , and with her face hidden by her hands was giving free <unk> to the <unk> and tears which had been so long restrained by the presence of her son .
Monte Cristo advanced a few steps , which were heard on the <unk> .
Mercédès raised her head , and uttered a cry of terror on <unk> a man before her .
<unk> “ Madame , ” said the count , “ it is no longer in my power to restore you to happiness , but I offer you consolation ; will you <unk> to accept it as coming from a friend ? ” “ I am , indeed , most wretched , ” replied Mercédès .
“ <unk> in the world , I had but my son , and he has left me ! ” “ He possesses a noble heart , madame , ” replied the count , “ and he has acted rightly .
He feels that every man <unk> a <unk> to his country ; some <unk> their talents , others their <unk> ; these <unk> their blood , those their <unk> <unk> , to the same cause .
Had he remained with you , his life must have become a <unk> burden , nor would he have <unk> in your <unk> .
He will increase in strength and honor by <unk> with <unk> , which he will <unk> into prosperity .
Leave him to <unk> up the future for you , and I venture to say you will <unk> it to safe hands . ” “ Oh , ” replied the wretched woman , <unk> shaking her head , “ the prosperity of which you speak , and which , from the bottom of my heart , I pray God in his mercy to grant him , I can never enjoy .
The bitter cup of <unk> has been <unk> by me to the very <unk> , and I feel that the grave is not far distant .
You have acted kindly , count , in bringing me back to the place where I have enjoyed so much <unk> .
I ought to meet death on the same spot where happiness was once all my own . ” “ Alas , ” said Monte Cristo , “ your words <unk> and <unk> my heart , the more so as you have every reason to hate me .
I have been the cause of all your misfortunes ; but why do you pity , instead of <unk> me ?
You render me still more unhappy — — ” “ <unk> you , blame you — _ you _ , Edmond !
<unk> , reproach , the man that has spared my son ’ s life !
For was it not your fatal and <unk> intention to destroy that son of whom M. de Morcerf was so proud ?
Oh , look at me closely , and discover , if you can , even the <unk> of a reproach in me . ” The count looked up and fixed his eyes on Mercédès , who arose partly from her seat and extended both her hands towards him .
“ Oh , look at me , ” continued she , with a feeling of profound melancholy , “ my eyes no longer <unk> by their <unk> , for the time has long fled since I used to smile on Edmond Dantès , who anxiously looked out for me from the window of yonder garret , then inhabited by his old father .
<unk> of grief have created an abyss between those days and the present .
I neither reproach you nor hate you , my friend .
Oh , no , Edmond , it is myself that I blame , myself that I hate !
Oh , miserable creature that I am ! ” cried she , <unk> her hands , and raising her eyes to heaven .
“ I once possessed <unk> , innocence , and love , the three <unk> of the happiness of angels , and now what am I ? ” Monte Cristo approached her , and silently took her hand .
“ No , ” said she , <unk> it gently — “ no , my friend , touch me not .
You have spared me , yet of all those who have fallen under your vengeance I was the most guilty .
They were <unk> by hatred , by <unk> , and by <unk> ; but I was base , and for want of courage acted against my judgment .
Nay , do not press my hand , Edmond ; you are thinking , I am sure , of some kind speech to console me , but do not utter it to me , reserve it for others more worthy of your kindness .
See ” ( and she exposed her face completely to view ) — “ see , misfortune has <unk> my hair , my eyes have shed so many tears that they are <unk> by a <unk> of purple , and my brow is wrinkled .
You , Edmond , on the contrary , — you are still young , handsome , <unk> ; it is because you have had faith ; because you have had strength , because you have had trust in God , and God has sustained you .
But as for me , I have been a coward ; I have denied God and he has abandoned me . ” <unk> Mercédès burst into tears ; her woman ’ s heart was breaking under its <unk> of memories .
Monte Cristo took her hand and <unk> a kiss on it ; but she herself felt that it was a kiss of no greater warmth than he would have bestowed on the hand of some marble statue of a <unk> .
“ It often happens , ” continued she , “ that a first fault <unk> the prospects of a whole life .
I believed you dead ; why did I survive you ?
What good has it done me to <unk> for you <unk> in the secret <unk> of my heart ? — only to make a woman of <unk> look like a woman of fifty .
Why , having recognized you , and I the only one to do so — why was I able to save my son alone ?
<unk> I not also to have <unk> the man that I had accepted for a husband , guilty though he were ?
Yet I let him die !
What do I say ?
Oh , <unk> heavens , was I not <unk> to his death by my <unk> <unk> , by my contempt for him , not <unk> , or not willing to remember , that it was for my sake he had become a <unk> and a <unk> ?
In what am I <unk> by <unk> my son so far , since I now abandon him , and allow him to depart alone to the <unk> <unk> of <unk> ?
Oh , I have been base , <unk> , I tell you ; I have <unk> my affections , and like all <unk> I am of evil <unk> to those who <unk> me ! ” “ No , Mercédès , ” said Monte Cristo , “ no ; you judge yourself with too much severity .
You are a <unk> woman , and it was your grief that <unk> me .
Still I was but an agent , led on by an invisible and offended <unk> , who chose not to <unk> the fatal blow that I was destined to <unk> .
I take that God to witness , at whose feet I have <unk> myself daily for the last ten years , that I would have <unk> my life to you , and with my life the projects that were <unk> <unk> with it .
But — and I say it with some pride , Mercédès — God needed me , and I lived .
<unk> the past and the present , and endeavor to <unk> into <unk> , and then say whether I am not a divine instrument .
The most dreadful misfortunes , the most frightful sufferings , the <unk> of all those who loved me , the <unk> of those who did not know me , formed the <unk> of my youth ; when suddenly , from <unk> , solitude , misery , I was restored to light and liberty , and became the <unk> of a fortune so brilliant , so <unk> , so <unk> , that I must have been blind not to be conscious that God had <unk> me with it to work out his own great <unk> .
From that time I looked upon this fortune as something <unk> to me for a particular purpose .
Not a thought was given to a life which you once , Mercédès , had the power to render <unk> ; not one hour of peaceful calm was mine ; but I felt myself driven on like an <unk> angel .
Like <unk> <unk> about to <unk> on some <unk> full of danger , I laid in my provisions , I loaded my weapons , I collected every means of attack and defence ; I <unk> my body to the most violent <unk> , my soul to the <unk> <unk> ; I taught my arm to <unk> , my eyes to behold <unk> sufferings , and my mouth to smile at the most horrid spectacles .
<unk> , <unk> , and <unk> as I had been , I became <unk> , cunning , and wicked , or rather , <unk> as fate .
Then I <unk> out into the path that was opened to me .
I <unk> every obstacle , and reached the <unk> ; but <unk> to those who stood in my <unk> ! ” <unk> “ <unk> , ” said Mercédès ; “ enough , Edmond !
Believe me , that she who alone recognized you has been the only one to comprehend you ; and had she crossed your path , and you had crushed her like glass , still , Edmond , still she must have admired you !
Like the gulf between me and the past , there is an abyss between you , Edmond , and the rest of mankind ; and I tell you freely that the comparison I draw between you and other men will ever be one of my greatest <unk> .
No , there is nothing in the world to resemble you in worth and goodness !
But we must say farewell , Edmond , and let us part . ” “ Before I leave you , Mercédès , have you no request to make ? ” said the count .
“ I desire but one thing in this world , Edmond , — the happiness of my son . ” “ Pray to the <unk> to spare his life , and I will take upon myself to <unk> his happiness . ” “ Thank you , Edmond . ” “ But have you no request to make for yourself , Mercédès ? ” “ For myself I want nothing .
I live , as it were , between two <unk> .
One is that of Edmond Dantès , lost to me long , long since .
He had my love !
That word ill becomes my <unk> lip now , but it is a memory dear to my heart , and one that I would not lose for all that the world contains .
The other grave is that of the man who met his death from the hand of Edmond Dantès .
I approve of the deed , but I must pray for the dead . ” “ Your son shall be happy , Mercédès , ” repeated the count .
“ Then I shall enjoy as much happiness as this world can possibly <unk> . ” “ But what are your intentions ? ” Mercédès smiled sadly .
“ To say that I shall live here , like the Mercédès of other times , <unk> my bread by labor , would not be true , nor would you believe me .
I have no longer the strength to do anything but to spend my days in prayer .
However , I shall have no occasion to work , for the little sum of money buried by you , and which I found in the place you mentioned , will be sufficient to <unk> me .
<unk> will probably be busy respecting me , my <unk> , my manner of living — that will signify but little , that concerns God , you , and myself . ” “ Mercédès , ” said the count , “ I do not say it to blame you , but you made an unnecessary sacrifice in <unk> the whole of the fortune <unk> by M. de Morcerf ; half of it at least by right belonged to you , in virtue of your <unk> and <unk> . ” “ I perceive what you are intending to propose to me ; but I cannot accept it , Edmond — my son would not permit it . ” “ Nothing shall be done without the full approbation of Albert de Morcerf .
I will make myself acquainted with his intentions and will submit to them .
But if he be willing to accept my offers , will you oppose them ? ” “ You well know , Edmond , that I am no longer a reasoning creature ; I have no will , unless it be the will never to decide .
I have been so overwhelmed by the many <unk> that have broken over my head , that I am become <unk> in the hands of the <unk> , like a <unk> in the <unk> of an eagle .
I live , because it is not <unk> for me to die .
If <unk> be sent to me , I will accept it . ” “ Ah , madame , ” said Monte Cristo , “ you should not talk thus !
It is not so we should <unk> our resignation to the will of heaven ; on the contrary , we are all free agents . ” “ Alas ! ” exclaimed Mercédès , “ if it were so , if I possessed <unk> , but without the power to render that will <unk> , it would drive me to despair . ” Monte Cristo dropped his head and <unk> from the <unk> of her grief .
“ Will you not even say you will see me again ? ” he asked .
“ On the contrary , we shall meet again , ” said Mercédès , pointing to heaven with solemnity .
“ I tell you so to prove to you that I still hope . ” And after pressing her own trembling hand upon that of the count , Mercédès rushed up the stairs and disappeared .
Monte Cristo slowly left the house and turned towards the quay .
But Mercédès did not witness his departure , although she was seated at the little window of the room which had been occupied by old Dantès .
Her eyes were <unk> to see the ship which was carrying her son over the vast sea ; but still her voice <unk> murmured softly : “ Edmond , Edmond , Edmond ! ” Chapter <unk> .
The <unk> The count departed with a sad heart from the house in which he had left Mercédès , probably never to behold her again .
Since the death of little Edward a great change had taken place in Monte Cristo .
Having reached the summit of his vengeance by a long and <unk> path , he saw an abyss of doubt <unk> before him .
More than this , the conversation which had just taken place between Mercédès and himself had awakened so many recollections in his heart that he felt it necessary to combat with them .
A man of the count ’ s <unk> could not long indulge in that melancholy which can exist in common minds , but which <unk> superior ones .
He thought he must have made an error in his <unk> if he now found cause to blame himself .
“ I cannot have deceived myself , ” he said ; “ I must look upon the past in a false light .
What ! ” he continued , “ can I have been following a false path ? — can the end which I proposed be a mistaken end ? — can one hour have sufficed to prove to an <unk> that the work upon which he <unk> all his hopes was an impossible , if not a <unk> , <unk> ?
I cannot <unk> myself to this idea — it would <unk> me .
The reason why I am now <unk> is that I have not a clear <unk> of the past .
The past , like the country through which we walk , becomes <unk> as we advance .
My position is like that of a person wounded in a dream ; he feels the wound , though he cannot recollect when he received it .
“ Come , then , thou <unk> man , thou <unk> <unk> , thou awakened <unk> , thou <unk> <unk> , thou <unk> <unk> , — once again <unk> thy past life of <unk> and wretchedness , <unk> the scenes where fate and misfortune conducted , and where despair received thee .
<unk> many diamonds , too much gold and splendor , are now reflected by the mirror in which Monte Cristo <unk> to behold Dantès .
<unk> thy diamonds , <unk> thy gold , <unk> thy splendor , exchange riches for poverty , liberty for a prison , a living body for a corpse ! ” As he thus <unk> , Monte Cristo walked down the Rue de la <unk> .
It was the same through which , <unk> years ago , he had been conducted by a silent and nocturnal guard ; the houses , today so smiling and animated , were on that night dark , mute , and closed .
“ And yet they were the same , ” murmured Monte Cristo , “ only now it is broad daylight instead of night ; it is the sun which <unk> the place , and makes it appear so cheerful . ” He proceeded towards the quay by the Rue <unk> , and advanced to the <unk> ; it was the point where he had <unk> .
A <unk> with <unk> <unk> was going by .
Monte Cristo called the owner , who immediately <unk> up to him with the eagerness of a <unk> hoping for a good <unk> .
The weather was magnificent , and the <unk> a treat .
The sun , red and <unk> , was sinking into the embrace of the <unk> ocean .
The sea , smooth as <unk> , was now and then disturbed by the <unk> of fish , which were pursued by some <unk> enemy and sought for safety in another element ; while on the extreme verge of the horizon might be seen the <unk> ’ s <unk> , white and graceful as the <unk> , or the merchant <unk> bound for Corsica or Spain .
But notwithstanding the serene sky , the <unk> formed <unk> , and the golden light in which the whole scene was bathed , the Count of Monte Cristo , wrapped in his cloak , could think only of this terrible voyage , the details of which were one by one recalled to his memory .
The solitary light burning at the Catalans ; that first sight of the Château d ’ If , which told him whither they were leading him ; the struggle with the gendarmes when he wished to throw himself <unk> ; his despair when he found himself <unk> , and the sensation when the <unk> of the <unk> touched his forehead — all these were brought before him in <unk> and frightful reality .
Like the <unk> which the heat of the summer has dried up , and which after the <unk> <unk> gradually begin <unk> drop by drop , so did the count feel his heart gradually fill with the bitterness which formerly nearly overwhelmed Edmond Dantès .
<unk> sky , <unk> <unk> , and brilliant sunshine disappeared ; the heavens were hung with black , and the gigantic <unk> of the Château d ’ If seemed like the phantom of a mortal enemy .
As they reached the shore , the count instinctively <unk> to the extreme end of the boat , and the owner was obliged to call out , in his <unk> tone of voice : “ Sir , we are at the landing . ” Monte Cristo remembered that on that very spot , on the same rock , he had been violently dragged by the guards , who forced him to ascend the slope at the points of their bayonets .
The journey had seemed very long to Dantès , but Monte Cristo found it equally short .
Each stroke of the <unk> seemed to <unk> a new throng of ideas , which sprang up with the flying <unk> of the sea .
<unk> There had been no prisoners confined in the Château d ’ If since the revolution of July ; it was only inhabited by a guard , kept there for the <unk> of <unk> .
A concierge waited at the door to <unk> to visitors this <unk> of curiosity , once a scene of terror .
The count inquired whether any of the ancient <unk> were still there ; but they had all been <unk> , or had passed on to some other employment .
The concierge who attended him had only been there since 1830 .
He visited his own dungeon .
He again beheld the dull light <unk> endeavoring to penetrate the narrow opening .
His eyes rested upon the spot where had stood his bed , since then removed , and behind the bed the new stones indicated where the <unk> made by the Abbé Faria had been .
Monte Cristo felt his limbs tremble ; he seated himself upon a <unk> of wood .
“ Are there any stories connected with this prison besides the one relating to the <unk> of <unk> ? ” asked the count ; “ are there any <unk> respecting these <unk> <unk> , — in which it is difficult to believe men can ever have <unk> their <unk> ? ” “ Yes , sir ; indeed , the jailer <unk> told me one connected with this very dungeon . ” Monte Cristo shuddered ; <unk> had been his jailer .
He had almost forgotten his name and face , but at the mention of the name he recalled his person as he used to see it , the face <unk> by a beard , wearing the brown <unk> , the bunch of keys , the <unk> of which he still seemed to hear .
The count turned around , and fancied he saw him in the corridor , rendered still <unk> by the torch carried by the concierge .
“ Would you like to hear the story , sir ? ” “ Yes ; relate it , ” said Monte Cristo , pressing his hand to his heart to still its violent <unk> ; he felt afraid of hearing his own history .
“ This dungeon , ” said the concierge , “ was , it appears , some time ago occupied by a very dangerous prisoner , the more so since he was full of <unk> .
Another person was confined in the Château at the same time , but he was not wicked , he was only a poor mad priest . ” “ Ah , indeed ? — mad ! ” repeated Monte Cristo ; “ and what was his <unk> ? ” “ He offered millions to anyone who would set him at liberty . ” Monte Cristo raised his eyes , but he could not see the heavens ; there was a stone veil between him and the <unk> .
He thought that there had been no less thick a veil before the eyes of those to whom Faria offered the treasures .
“ Could the prisoners see each other ? ” he asked .
“ Oh , no , sir , it was <unk> forbidden ; but they <unk> the <unk> of the guards , and made a passage from one dungeon to the other . ” “ And which of them made this passage ? ” “ Oh , it must have been the young man , certainly , for he was strong and <unk> , while the abbé was aged and weak ; besides , his mind was too <unk> to allow him to carry out an idea . ” “ <unk> <unk> ! ” murmured the count .
“ However , be that as it may , the young man made a <unk> , how or by what means no one knows ; but he made it , and there is the evidence yet remaining of his work .
Do you see it ? ” and the man held the torch to the wall .
<unk> “ Ah , yes ; I see , ” said the count , in a voice hoarse from emotion .
“ The result was that the two men communicated with one another ; how long they did so , nobody knows .
One day the old man fell ill and died .
Now guess what the young one did ? ” “ Tell me . ” “ He carried off the corpse , which he placed in his own bed with its face to the wall ; then he entered the empty dungeon , closed the entrance , and slipped into the <unk> which had contained the dead body .
Did you ever hear of such an idea ? ” Monte Cristo closed his eyes , and seemed again to experience all the sensations he had felt when the coarse canvas , yet <unk> with the cold <unk> of death , had touched his face .
The jailer continued : “ Now this was his project .
He fancied that they buried the dead at the Château d ’ If , and <unk> they would not <unk> much labor on the grave of a prisoner , he calculated on raising the earth with his shoulders , but unfortunately their arrangements at the Château <unk> his projects .
They never buried the dead ; they merely attached a heavy <unk> to the feet , and then threw them into the sea .
This is what was done .
The young man was thrown from the top of the rock ; the corpse was found on the bed next day , and the whole truth was guessed , for the men who performed the office then mentioned what they had not dared to speak of before , that at the moment the corpse was thrown into the deep , they heard a <unk> , which was almost immediately stifled by the water in which it disappeared . ” The count breathed with difficulty ; the cold drops ran down his forehead , and his heart was full of anguish .
“ No , ” he muttered , “ the doubt I felt was but the <unk> of forgetfulness ; but here the wound <unk> , and the heart again <unk> for vengeance .
And the prisoner , ” he continued aloud , “ was he ever heard of afterwards ? ” “ Oh , no ; of course not .
You can understand that one of two things must have happened ; he must either have fallen flat , in which case the blow , from a height of <unk> feet , must have killed him instantly , or he must have fallen upright , and then the weight would have dragged him to the bottom , where he remained — poor fellow ! ” “ Then you pity him ? ” said the count .
“ _ Ma foi _ , yes ; though he was in his own element . ” “ What do you mean ? ” “ The report was that he had been a <unk> officer , who had been confined for <unk> with the <unk> . ” “ Great is truth , ” muttered the count , “ fire cannot burn , nor water <unk> it !
Thus the poor sailor lives in the recollection of those who <unk> his history ; his terrible story is <unk> in the <unk> , and a shudder is felt at the description of his <unk> through the air to be swallowed by the deep . ” Then , the count added aloud , “ Was his name ever known ? ” “ Oh , yes ; but only as No .
<unk> . ” “ Oh , Villefort , Villefort , ” murmured the count , “ this scene must often have <unk> thy <unk> hours ! ” “ Do you wish to see anything more , sir ? ” said the concierge .
“ Yes , especially if you will show me the poor abbé ’ s room . ” “ Ah !
No .
<unk> . ” “ Yes ; No .
<unk> . ” repeated the count , who seemed to hear the voice of the abbé answering him in those very words through the wall when asked his name .
“ Come , sir . ” “ Wait , ” said Monte Cristo , “ I wish to take one final glance around this room . ” “ This is fortunate , ” said the guide ; “ I have forgotten the other key . ” “ Go and fetch it . ” “ I will leave you the torch , sir . ” “ No , take it away ; I can see in the dark . ” “ Why , you are like No .
<unk> .
They said he was so accustomed to darkness that he could see a <unk> in the <unk> corner of his dungeon . ” “ He spent fourteen years to arrive at that , ” muttered the count .
The guide carried away the torch .
The count had spoken <unk> .
<unk> had a few seconds elapsed , ere he saw everything as distinctly as by daylight .
Then he looked around him , and really recognized his dungeon .
“ Yes , ” he said , “ there is the stone upon which I used to sit ; there is the impression made by my shoulders on the wall ; there is the mark of my blood made when one day I dashed my head against the wall .
Oh , those figures , how well I remember them !
I made them one day to <unk> the age of my father , that I might know whether I should find him still living , and that of Mercédès , to know if I should find her still free .
After <unk> that <unk> , I had a minute ’ s hope .
I did not <unk> upon hunger and <unk> ! ” and a bitter laugh escaped the count .
He saw in fancy the <unk> of his father , and the marriage of Mercédès .
On the other side of the dungeon he perceived an <unk> , the white letters of which were still visible on the green wall : “ ‘ _ Oh , God ! _ ’ ” he read , “ ‘ _ preserve my memory ! _ ’ ” “ Oh , yes , ” he cried , “ that was my only prayer at last ; I no longer begged for liberty , but memory ; I dreaded to become mad and <unk> .
Oh , God , thou <unk> preserved my memory ; I thank thee , I thank thee ! ” At this moment the light of the torch was reflected on the wall ; the guide was coming ; Monte Cristo went to meet him .
“ <unk> me , sir ; ” and without <unk> the stairs the guide conducted him by a <unk> passage to another entrance .
There , again , Monte Cristo was <unk> by a multitude of thoughts .
The first thing that met his eye was the <unk> , drawn by the abbé on the wall , by which he calculated the time ; then he saw the remains of the bed on which the poor prisoner had died .
The sight of this , instead of <unk> the anguish experienced by the count in the dungeon , filled his heart with a soft and grateful sentiment , and tears fell from his eyes .
“ This is where the mad abbé was kept , sir , and that is where the young man entered ; ” and the guide pointed to the opening , which had remained <unk> .
“ From the appearance of the stone , ” he continued , “ a learned gentleman discovered that the prisoners might have communicated together for ten years .
Poor things !
Those must have been ten weary years . ” Dantès took some louis from his pocket , and gave them to the man who had twice unconsciously <unk> him .
The guide took them , thinking them merely a few pieces of little value ; but the light of the torch revealed their true worth .
“ Sir , ” he said , “ you have made a mistake ; you have given me gold . ” “ I know it . ” The concierge looked upon the count with surprise .
“ Sir , ” he cried , scarcely able to believe his good fortune — “ sir , I cannot understand your <unk> ! ” “ Oh , it is very simple , my good fellow ; I have been a sailor , and your story touched me more than it would others . ” “ Then , sir , since you are so liberal , I ought to offer you something . ” <unk> “ What have you to offer to me , my friend ?
<unk> ?
<unk> ?
Thank you ! ” “ No , sir , neither of those ; something connected with this story . ” “ Really ?
What is it ? ” “ Listen , ” said the guide ; “ I said to myself , ‘ Something is always left in a cell inhabited by one prisoner for fifteen years , ’ so I began to sound the wall . ” “ Ah , ” cried Monte Cristo , <unk> the abbé ’ s two <unk> .
“ After some search , I found that the floor gave a hollow sound near the head of the bed , and at the hearth . ” “ Yes , ” said the count , “ yes . ” “ I raised the stones , and found — — ” “ A <unk> and some tools ? ” “ How do you know that ? ” asked the guide in astonishment .
“ I do not know — I only guess it , because that sort of thing is generally found in prisoners ’ <unk> . ” “ Yes , sir , a <unk> and tools . ” “ And have you them yet ? ” “ No , sir ; I sold them to visitors , who considered them great <unk> ; but I have still something left . ” “ What is it ? ” asked the count , impatiently .
“ A sort of book , written upon <unk> of cloth . ” “ Go and fetch it , my good fellow ; and if it be what I hope , you will do well . ” “ I will run for it , sir ; ” and the guide went out .
Then the count knelt down by the side of the bed , which death had converted into an altar .
“ Oh , second father , ” he exclaimed , “ thou who <unk> given me liberty , knowledge , riches ; thou who , like beings of a superior order to ourselves , <unk> understand the science of good and evil ; if in the depths of the tomb there still remain something within us which can <unk> to the voice of those who are left on earth ; if after death the soul ever <unk> the places where we have lived and suffered , — then , noble heart , sublime soul , then I <unk> thee by the paternal love thou <unk> bear me , by the <unk> obedience I <unk> to thee , grant me some sign , some <unk> !
<unk> from me the remains of doubt , which , if it change not to conviction , must become remorse ! ” The count bowed his head , and clasped his hands together .
“ Here , sir , ” said a voice behind him .
Monte Cristo shuddered , and arose .
The concierge held out the <unk> of cloth upon which the Abbé Faria had spread the riches of his mind .
The <unk> was the great work by the Abbé Faria upon the <unk> of Italy .
The count seized it hastily , his eyes immediately fell upon the <unk> , and he read : “ Thou <unk> tear out the <unk> ’ teeth , and shall <unk> the <unk> under foot , <unk> the Lord . ” “ Ah , ” he exclaimed , “ here is my answer .
Thanks , father , thanks . ” And feeling in his pocket , he took thence a small pocket-book , which contained ten bank-notes , each of <unk> francs .
“ Here , ” he said , “ take this pocket-book . ” “ Do you give it to me ? ” “ Yes ; but only on condition that you will not open it till I am gone ; ” and placing in his breast the treasure he had just found , which was more valuable to him than the <unk> <unk> , he rushed out of the corridor , and reaching his boat , cried , “ To Marseilles ! ” Then , as he departed , he fixed his eyes upon the gloomy prison .
“ <unk> , ” he cried , “ to those who confined me in that wretched prison ; and <unk> to those who forgot that I was there ! ” <unk> As he <unk> the Catalans , the count turned around and <unk> his head in his cloak murmured the name of a woman .
The victory was complete ; twice he had overcome his doubts .
The name he pronounced , in a voice of tenderness , <unk> almost to love , was that of Haydée .
On landing , the count turned towards the cemetery , where he felt sure of finding Morrel .
He , too , ten years ago , had <unk> sought out a tomb , and sought it <unk> .
He , who returned to France with millions , had been unable to find the grave of his father , who had <unk> from hunger .
Morrel had indeed placed a cross over the spot , but it had fallen down and the grave-digger had burnt it , as he did all the old wood in the churchyard .
The worthy merchant had been more fortunate .
<unk> in the arms of his children , he had been by them laid by the side of his wife , who had preceded him in eternity by two years .
Two large <unk> of marble , on which were <unk> their names , were placed on either side of a little enclosure , <unk> in , and <unk> by four <unk> .
Morrel was leaning against one of these , mechanically fixing his eyes on the <unk> .
His grief was so profound that he was nearly unconscious .
<unk> “ Maximilian , ” said the count , “ you should not look on the <unk> , but there ; ” and he pointed <unk> .
“ The dead are everywhere , ” said Morrel ; “ did you not yourself tell me so as we left Paris ? ” “ Maximilian , ” said the count , “ you asked me during the journey to allow you to remain some days at Marseilles .
Do you still wish to do so ? ” “ I have no wishes , count ; only I fancy I could pass the time less <unk> here than anywhere else . ” “ So much the better , for I must leave you ; but I carry your word with me , do I not ? ” “ Ah , count , I shall forget it . ” “ No , you will not forget it , because you are a man of honor , Morrel , because you have taken an oath , and are about to do so again . ” “ Oh , count , have pity upon me .
I am so unhappy . ” “ I have known a man much more unfortunate than you , Morrel . ” “ Impossible ! ” “ Alas , ” said Monte Cristo , “ it is the <unk> of our nature always to believe ourselves much more unhappy than those who groan by our sides ! ” “ What can be more wretched than the man who has lost all he loved and desired in the world ? ” “ Listen , Morrel , and pay attention to what I am about to tell you .
I knew a man who like you had fixed all his hopes of happiness upon a woman .
He was young , he had an old father whom he loved , a betrothed bride whom he adored .
He was about to marry her , when one of the <unk> of fate , — which would almost make us doubt the goodness of Providence , if that Providence did not afterwards reveal itself by <unk> that all is but a means of <unk> to an end , — one of those <unk> deprived him of his mistress , of the future of which he had dreamed ( for in his blindness he forgot he could only read the present ) , and cast him into a dungeon . ” “ Ah , ” said Morrel , “ one <unk> a dungeon in a week , a month , or a year . ” “ He remained there fourteen years , Morrel , ” said the count , placing his hand on the young man ’ s shoulder .
Maximilian shuddered .
“ <unk> years ! ” he muttered .
“ <unk> years ! ” repeated the count .
“ During that time he had many moments of despair .
He also , Morrel , like you , considered himself the <unk> of men . ” “ Well ? ” asked Morrel .
“ Well , at the height of his despair God assisted him through human means .
At first , perhaps , he did not recognize the infinite mercy of the Lord , but at last he took patience and waited .
One day he <unk> left the prison , <unk> , rich , powerful .
His first cry was for his father ; but that father was dead . ” “ My father , too , is dead , ” said Morrel .
“ Yes ; but your father died in your arms , happy , respected , rich , and full of years ; his father died poor , despairing , almost doubtful of Providence ; and when his son sought his grave ten years afterwards , his tomb had disappeared , and no one could say , ‘ There <unk> the father you so well loved . ’ ” “ Oh ! ” exclaimed Morrel .
“ He was , then , a more unhappy son than you , Morrel , for he could not even find his father ’ s grave . ” “ But then he had the woman he loved still remaining ? ” “ You are deceived , Morrel , that woman — — ” “ She was dead ? ” “ <unk> than that , she was <unk> , and had married one of the <unk> of her betrothed .
You see , then , Morrel , that he was a more unhappy lover than you . ” “ And has he found consolation ? ” “ He has at least found peace . ” “ And does he ever expect to be happy ? ” “ He hopes so , Maximilian . ” The young man ’ s head fell on his breast .
“ You have my promise , ” he said , after a minute ’ s pause , extending his hand to Monte Cristo .
“ Only remember — — ” “ On the 5th of October , Morrel , I shall expect you at the Island of Monte Cristo .
On the <unk> a yacht will wait for you in the port of <unk> , it will be called the _ <unk> _ .
You will give your name to the captain , who will bring you to me .
It is understood — is it not ? ” “ But , count , do you remember that the 5th of October — — ” “ <unk> , ” replied the count , “ not to know the value of a man ’ s word !
I have told you twenty times that if you wish to die on that day , I will assist you .
Morrel , farewell ! ” “ Do you leave me ? ” “ Yes ; I have business in Italy .
I leave you alone in your struggle with misfortune — alone with that <unk> eagle which God sends to bear <unk> the <unk> to his feet .
The story of <unk> , Maximilian , is not a <unk> , but an <unk> . ” “ When do you leave ? ” “ <unk> ; the <unk> <unk> , and in an hour I shall be far from you .
Will you accompany me to the <unk> , Maximilian ? ” <unk> “ I am entirely yours , count . ” Morrel accompanied the count to the <unk> .
The white <unk> was <unk> like a <unk> of <unk> from the black chimney .
The <unk> soon disappeared , and in an hour afterwards , as the count had said , was scarcely <unk> in the horizon <unk> the <unk> of the night .
Chapter <unk> .
Peppino At the same time that the <unk> disappeared behind <unk> <unk> , a man travelling post on the road from <unk> to Rome had just passed the little town of <unk> .
He was travelling fast enough to cover a great deal of ground without <unk> suspicion .
This man was dressed in a <unk> , or rather a <unk> , a little worse for the journey , but which exhibited the ribbon of the Legion of Honor still fresh and brilliant , a <unk> which also ornamented the under coat .
He might be recognized , not only by these signs , but also from the accent with which he spoke to the <unk> , as a Frenchman .
Another proof that he was a native of the universal country was apparent in the fact of his knowing no other Italian words than the terms used in music , and which like the “ <unk> ” of <unk> , served all possible <unk> requirements .
“ _ <unk> ! _ ” he called out to the <unk> at every <unk> .
“ _ <unk> ! _ ” he cried as they descended .
And heaven knows there are hills enough between Rome and <unk> by the way of <unk> !
These two words greatly amused the men to whom they were addressed .
On reaching La <unk> , the point from whence Rome is first visible , the traveller <unk> none of the enthusiastic curiosity which usually leads strangers to stand up and endeavor to catch sight of the <unk> of Saint <unk> ’ s , which may be seen long before any other object is <unk> .
No , he merely drew a <unk> from his pocket , and took from it a paper folded in four , and after having examined it in a manner almost <unk> , he said : “ Good !
I have it still ! ” <unk> The carriage entered by the <unk> del <unk> , turned to the left , and stopped at the Hôtel d ’ <unk> .
Old Pastrini , our former acquaintance , received the traveller at the door , hat in hand .
The traveller <unk> , ordered a good dinner , and inquired the address of the house of Thomson &amp; French , which was immediately given to him , as it was one of the most celebrated in Rome .
It was situated in the <unk> <unk> <unk> , near St. <unk> ’ s .
In Rome , as everywhere else , the arrival of a <unk> is an event .
Ten young <unk> of Marius and the <unk> , <unk> and out at elbows , with one hand resting on the <unk> and the other <unk> <unk> above the head , stared at the traveller , the <unk> , and the horses ; to these were added about fifty little <unk> from the <unk> States , who earned a <unk> by <unk> into the <unk> at high water from the bridge of St. <unk> .
Now , as these street <unk> of Rome , more fortunate than those of Paris , understand every language , more especially the French , they heard the traveller order an apartment , a dinner , and finally inquire the way to the house of Thomson &amp; French .
The result was that when the <unk> left the hotel with the _ <unk> _ , a man detached himself from the rest of the <unk> , and without having been seen by the traveller , and appearing to excite no attention from the guide , followed the stranger with as much skill as a Parisian police agent would have used .
The Frenchman had been so impatient to reach the house of Thomson &amp; French that he would not wait for the horses to be <unk> , but left word for the carriage to <unk> him on the road , or to wait for him at the <unk> ’ door .
He reached it before the carriage arrived .
The Frenchman entered , leaving in the <unk> his guide , who immediately entered into conversation with two or three of the <unk> <unk> who are always to be found in Rome at the doors of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , or <unk> .
With the Frenchman , the man who had followed him entered too ; the Frenchman knocked at the inner door , and entered the first room ; his shadow did the same .
“ <unk>
Thomson &amp; French ? ” inquired the stranger .
An attendant arose at a sign from a <unk> clerk at the first desk .
“ <unk> shall I announce ? ” said the attendant .
“ Baron Danglars . ” “ <unk> me , ” said the man .
A door opened , through which the attendant and the baron disappeared .
The man who had followed Danglars sat down on a bench .
The clerk continued to write for the next five minutes ; the man preserved profound silence , and remained perfectly motionless .
Then the pen of the clerk ceased to move over the paper ; he raised his head , and appearing to be perfectly sure of <unk> : “ Ah , <unk> , ” he said , “ here you are , Peppino ! ” “ Yes , ” was the <unk> reply .
“ You have found out that there is something worth having about this large gentleman ? ” “ There is no great merit due to me , for we were informed of it . ” “ You know his business here , then . ” “ _ <unk> _ , he has come to draw , but I don ’ t know how much ! ” “ You will know presently , my friend . ” “ Very well , only do not give me false information as you did the other day . ” “ What do you mean ? — of whom do you speak ?
Was it the Englishman who carried off <unk> crowns from here the other day ? ” <unk> “ No ; he really had <unk> crowns , and we found them .
I mean the <unk> prince , who you said had <unk> livres , and we only found <unk> . ” “ You must have searched badly . ” “ Luigi Vampa himself searched . ” “ In that case he must either have paid his debts — — ” “ A <unk> do that ? ” “ Or spent the money ? ” “ <unk> , after all . ” “ Certainly .
But you must let me make my <unk> , or the Frenchman will <unk> his business without my knowing the sum . ” Peppino nodded , and taking a <unk> from his pocket began to <unk> a few prayers while the clerk disappeared through the same door by which Danglars and the attendant had gone out .
At the expiration of ten minutes the clerk returned with a <unk> countenance .
“ Well ? ” asked Peppino of his friend .
“ <unk> , joy — the sum is large ! ” “ Five or six millions , is it not ? ” “ Yes , you know the amount . ” “ On the receipt of the Count of Monte Cristo ? ” “ Why , how came you to be so well acquainted with all this ? ” “ I told you we were informed beforehand . ” “ Then why do you apply to me ? ” “ That I may be sure I have the right man . ” “ Yes , it is indeed he .
Five millions — a pretty sum , <unk> , Peppino ? ” “ Hush — here is our man ! ” The clerk seized his pen , and Peppino his <unk> ; one was writing and the other praying when the door opened .
Danglars looked radiant with joy ; the banker accompanied him to the door .
Peppino followed Danglars .
<unk> to the arrangements , the carriage was waiting at the door .
The guide held the door open .
<unk> are useful people , who will turn their hands to anything .
Danglars leaped into the carriage like a young man of twenty .
The _ <unk> _ <unk> the door , and sprang up by the side of the coachman .
Peppino mounted the seat behind .
“ Will your excellency visit Saint <unk> ’ s ? ” asked the _ <unk> _ .
“ I did not come to Rome to see , ” said Danglars aloud ; then he added softly , with an <unk> smile , “ I came to touch ! ” and he <unk> his pocket-book , in which he had just placed a letter .
“ Then your excellency is going — — ” “ To the hotel . ” “ <unk> Pastrini ! ” said the _ <unk> _ to the coachman , and the carriage drove rapidly on .
<unk> Ten minutes afterwards the baron entered his apartment , and Peppino stationed himself on the bench outside the door of the hotel , after having whispered something in the ear of one of the <unk> of Marius and the <unk> whom we noticed at the beginning of the <unk> , who immediately ran down the road leading to the <unk> at his <unk> speed .
Danglars was tired and <unk> ; he therefore went to bed , placing his <unk> under his pillow .
Peppino had a little spare time , so he had a game of _ <unk> _ with the <unk> , lost three crowns , and then to console himself drank a bottle of <unk> .
The next morning Danglars awoke late , though he went to bed so early ; he had not slept well for five or six nights , even if he had slept at all .
He <unk> <unk> , and <unk> little , as he said , for the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , ordered <unk> at noon .
But Danglars had not <unk> upon the <unk> of the police and the <unk> of the <unk> .
The horses only arrived at two o ’ clock , and the _ <unk> _ did not bring the passport till three .
All these <unk> had collected a number of <unk> round the door of Signor Pastrini ’ s ; the <unk> of Marius and the <unk> were also not wanting .
The baron walked <unk> through the crowd , who for the sake of gain <unk> him “ your excellency . ” As Danglars had hitherto contented himself with being called a baron , he felt rather flattered at the title of excellency , and distributed a dozen silver <unk> among the <unk> , who were ready , for twelve more , to call him “ your <unk> . ” “ Which road ? ” asked the <unk> in Italian .
“ The <unk> road , ” replied the baron .
Signor Pastrini <unk> the question and answer , and the horses <unk> off .
Danglars intended travelling to <unk> , where he would receive one part of his fortune , and then proceeding to <unk> , where he would find the rest , he meant to take up his residence in the latter town , which he had been told was a city of pleasure .
He had scarcely advanced three leagues out of Rome when daylight began to disappear .
Danglars had not intended starting so late , or he would have remained ; he put his head out and asked the <unk> how long it would be before they reached the next town .
“ _ <unk> <unk> _ ” ( do not understand ) , was the reply .
Danglars bent his head , which he meant to <unk> , “ Very well . ” The carriage again moved on .
“ I will stop at the first <unk> , ” said Danglars to himself .
He still felt the same <unk> which he had experienced the previous evening , and which had procured him so good a night ’ s rest .
He was <unk> stretched in a good English <unk> , with double <unk> ; he was drawn by four good horses , at full <unk> ; he knew the <unk> to be at a distance of seven leagues .
What subject of meditation could present itself to the banker , so fortunately become <unk> ?
Danglars thought for ten minutes about his wife in Paris ; another ten minutes about his daughter travelling with Mademoiselle d ’ <unk> ; the same period was given to his <unk> , and the manner in which he intended <unk> their money ; and then , having no subject left for contemplation , he shut his eyes , and fell asleep .
Now and then a <unk> more violent than the rest caused him to open his eyes ; then he felt that he was still being carried with great rapidity over the same country , <unk> <unk> with broken <unk> , which looked like granite <unk> petrified while running a race .
But the night was cold , dull , and <unk> , and it was much more pleasant for a traveller to remain in the warm carriage than to put his head out of the window to make inquiries of a <unk> whose only answer was “ _ <unk> <unk> _ . ” <unk> Danglars therefore continued to sleep , saying to himself that he would be sure to awake at the <unk> .
The carriage stopped .
Danglars fancied that they had reached the <unk> point ; he opened his eyes and looked through the window , expecting to find himself in the midst of some town , or at least village ; but he saw nothing except what seemed like a ruin , where three or four men went and came like shadows .
Danglars waited a moment , expecting the <unk> to come and demand <unk> with the <unk> of his stage .
He intended taking advantage of the opportunity to make fresh inquiries of the new <unk> ; but the horses were <unk> , and others put in their places , without anyone <unk> money from the traveller .
Danglars , astonished , opened the door ; but a strong hand pushed him back , and the carriage rolled on .
The baron was completely roused .
“ <unk> ? ” he said to the <unk> , “ <unk> , _ <unk> <unk> ? _ ” This was another little piece of Italian the baron had learned from hearing his daughter sing Italian <unk> with Cavalcanti .
But _ <unk> <unk> _ did not reply .
Danglars then opened the window .
“ Come , my friend , ” he said , <unk> his hand through the opening , “ where are we going ? ” “ _ <unk> la <unk> ! _ ” answered a solemn and <unk> voice , accompanied by a <unk> gesture .
Danglars thought _ <unk> la <unk> _ meant , “ <unk> in your head ! ” He was making rapid progress in Italian .
He obeyed , not without some uneasiness , which , <unk> increasing , caused his mind , instead of being as <unk> as it was when he began his journey , to fill with ideas which were very likely to keep a traveller awake , more especially one in such a situation as Danglars .
His eyes acquired that quality which in the first moment of strong emotion <unk> them to see distinctly , and which afterwards <unk> from being too much <unk> .
Before we are alarmed , we see <unk> ; when we are alarmed , we see double ; and when we have been alarmed , we see nothing but trouble .
Danglars observed a man in a cloak <unk> at the right hand of the carriage .
“ Some gendarme ! ” he exclaimed .
“ Can I have been <unk> by French <unk> to the <unk> authorities ? ” He resolved to end his anxiety .
“ Where are you taking me ? ” he asked .
“ _ <unk> la <unk> _ , ” replied the same voice , with the same <unk> accent .
Danglars turned to the left ; another man on horseback was <unk> on that side .
“ <unk> , ” said Danglars , with the perspiration on his forehead , “ I must be under arrest . ” And he threw himself back in the <unk> , not this time to sleep , but to think .
<unk> afterwards the moon rose .
He then saw the great <unk> , those stone <unk> which he had before remarked , only then they were on the right hand , now they were on the left .
He understood that they had described a circle , and were bringing him back to Rome .
“ Oh , unfortunate ! ” he cried , “ they must have obtained my arrest . ” The carriage continued to roll on with frightful speed .
An hour of terror elapsed , for every spot they passed showed that they were on the road back .
At length he saw a dark mass , against which it seemed as if the carriage was about to <unk> ; but the vehicle turned to one side , leaving the barrier behind and Danglars saw that it was one of the <unk> <unk> Rome .
<unk> “ _ <unk> <unk> ! _ ” cried Danglars , “ we are not returning to Rome ; then it is not justice which is pursuing me !
<unk> heavens ; another idea presents itself — what if they should be — — ” His hair stood on end .
He remembered those interesting stories , so little believed in Paris , respecting Roman bandits ; he remembered the adventures that Albert de Morcerf had related when it was intended that he should marry Mademoiselle Eugénie .
“ They are <unk> , perhaps , ” he muttered .
Just then the carriage rolled on something <unk> than <unk> road .
Danglars <unk> a look on both sides of the road , and perceived <unk> of a singular form , and his mind now recalled all the details Morcerf had related , and <unk> them with his own situation , he felt sure that he must be on the <unk> <unk> .
On the left , in a sort of valley , he perceived a <unk> <unk> .
It was <unk> ’ s <unk> .
On a word from the man who <unk> at the side of the carriage , it stopped .
At the same time the door was opened .
“ _ <unk> ! _ ” exclaimed a <unk> voice .
Danglars instantly descended ; although he did not yet speak Italian , he understood it very well .
More dead than alive , he looked around him .
Four men surrounded him , besides the <unk> .
“ _ <unk> <unk> _ , ” said one of the men , descending a little path leading out of the <unk> <unk> .
Danglars followed his guide without opposition , and had no occasion to turn around to see whether the three others were following him .
Still it appeared as though they were stationed at equal <unk> from one another , like <unk> .
After walking for about ten minutes , during which Danglars did not exchange a single word with his guide , he found himself between a <unk> and a <unk> of high <unk> ; three men , standing silent , formed a <unk> , of which he was the centre .
He wished to speak , but his tongue refused to move .
“ _ <unk> ! _ ” said the same sharp and <unk> voice .
This time Danglars had double reason to understand , for if the word and gesture had not explained the <unk> ’ s meaning , it was clearly expressed by the man walking behind him , who pushed him so <unk> that he struck against the guide .
This guide was our friend Peppino , who dashed into the thicket of high <unk> , through a path which none but <unk> or <unk> could have imagined to be an open road .
Peppino stopped before a rock <unk> by thick <unk> ; the rock , half open , afforded a passage to the young man , who disappeared like the evil spirits in the <unk> <unk> .
The voice and gesture of the man who followed Danglars ordered him to do the same .
There was no longer any doubt , the <unk> was in the hands of Roman <unk> .
Danglars <unk> himself like a man placed between two dangerous <unk> , and who is rendered brave by fear .
<unk> his large stomach , certainly not intended to penetrate the <unk> of the <unk> , he <unk> down like Peppino , and closing his eyes fell upon his feet .
As he touched the ground , he opened his eyes .
<unk> The path was wide , but dark .
Peppino , who cared little for being recognized now that he was in his own <unk> , struck a light and lit a torch .
Two other men descended after Danglars forming the <unk> , and <unk> Danglars whenever he happened to stop , they came by a gentle <unk> to the <unk> of two <unk> .
The walls were <unk> out in <unk> , one above the other , and which seemed in contrast with the white stones to open their large dark eyes , like those which we see on the faces of the dead .
A sentinel struck the <unk> of his <unk> against his left hand .
“ Who comes there ? ” he cried .
“ A friend , a friend ! ” said Peppino ; “ but where is the captain ? ” “ There , ” said the sentinel , pointing over his shoulder to a <unk> <unk> , <unk> out of the rock , the lights from which shone into the passage through the large <unk> <unk> .
“ <unk> <unk> , captain , fine <unk> ! ” said Peppino in Italian , and taking Danglars by the collar of his coat he dragged him to an opening resembling a door , through which they entered the apartment which the captain appeared to have made his <unk> .
“ Is this the man ? ” asked the captain , who was attentively reading <unk> ’ s _ Life of Alexander _ .
“ <unk> , captain — himself . ” “ Very well , show him to me . ” At this rather <unk> order , Peppino raised his torch to the face of Danglars , who hastily withdrew that he might not have his <unk> burnt .
His agitated features presented the appearance of pale and hideous terror .
“ The man is tired , ” said the captain , “ conduct him to his bed . ” “ Oh , ” murmured Danglars , “ that bed is probably one of the <unk> <unk> in the wall , and the sleep I shall enjoy will be death from one of the <unk> I see <unk> in the darkness . ” From their beds of dried leaves or <unk> at the back of the chamber now arose the companions of the man who had been found by Albert de Morcerf reading _ Cæsar ’ s <unk> _ , and by Danglars <unk> the _ Life of Alexander _ .
The banker uttered a groan and followed his guide ; he neither <unk> nor exclaimed .
He no longer possessed strength , will , power , or feeling ; he followed where they led him .
At length he found himself at the foot of a staircase , and he mechanically lifted his foot five or six times .
Then a low door was opened before him , and bending his head to avoid striking his forehead he entered a small room cut out of the rock .
The cell was clean , though empty , and dry , though situated at an <unk> distance under the earth .
A bed of dried grass covered with <unk> was placed in one corner .
Danglars <unk> up on <unk> it , <unk> that it gave some promise of safety .
“ Oh , God be <unk> , ” he said ; “ it is a real bed ! ” This was the second time within the hour that he had <unk> the name of God .
He had not done so for ten years before .
“ _ <unk> ! _ ” said the guide , and <unk> Danglars into the cell , he closed the door upon him .
A bolt grated and Danglars was a prisoner .
If there had been no bolt , it would have been impossible for him to pass through the midst of the <unk> who held the <unk> of St. <unk> , <unk> round a master whom our <unk> must have recognized as the famous Luigi Vampa .
Danglars , too , had recognized the bandit , whose existence he would not believe when Albert de Morcerf mentioned him in Paris ; and not only did he recognize him , but the cell in which Albert had been confined , and which was probably kept for the <unk> of strangers .
These recollections were dwelt upon with some pleasure by Danglars , and restored him to some degree of tranquillity .
Since the bandits had not <unk> him at once , he felt that they would not kill him at all .
They had arrested him for the purpose of <unk> , and as he had only a few louis about him , he doubted not he would be <unk> .
He remembered that Morcerf had been <unk> at <unk> crowns , and as he considered himself of much greater importance than Morcerf he fixed his own price at <unk> crowns .
<unk> thousand crowns <unk> to <unk> livres ; he would then have about <unk> francs left .
With this sum he could manage to keep out of difficulties .
<unk> , tolerably secure in being able to <unk> himself from his position , provided he were not <unk> at the <unk> sum of <unk> francs , he stretched himself on his bed , and after turning over two or three times , fell asleep with the tranquillity of the hero whose life Luigi Vampa was <unk> .
Chapter <unk> .
Luigi Vampa ’ s <unk> of <unk> We awake from every sleep except the one dreaded by Danglars .
He awoke .
To a Parisian accustomed to <unk> curtains , walls hung with velvet <unk> , and the soft perfume of burning wood , the white smoke of which <unk> itself in graceful <unk> around the room , the appearance of the <unk> cell which <unk> his eyes on <unk> seemed like the <unk> of some disagreeable dream .
But in such a situation a single moment suffices to change the <unk> doubt into certainty .
“ Yes , yes , ” he murmured , “ I am in the hands of the <unk> of whom Albert de Morcerf spoke . ” His first idea was to breathe , that he might know whether he was wounded .
He <unk> this from _ Don <unk> _ , the only book he had ever read , but which he still slightly remembered .
“ No , ” he cried , “ they have not wounded , but perhaps they have robbed me ! ” and he thrust his hands into his pockets .
They were <unk> ; the hundred louis he had reserved for his journey from Rome to <unk> were in his trousers pocket , and in that of his <unk> he found the little <unk> containing his letter of credit for <unk> francs .
“ <unk> bandits ! ” he exclaimed ; “ they have left me my purse and pocket-book .
As I was saying last night , they intend me to be <unk> .
<unk> , here is my watch !
Let me see what time it is . ” Danglars ’ watch , one of <unk> ’ s <unk> , which he had carefully wound up on the previous night , struck half past five .
Without this , Danglars would have been quite ignorant of the time , for daylight did not reach his cell .
Should he demand an explanation from the bandits , or should he wait <unk> for them to propose it ?
The last <unk> seemed the most prudent , so he waited until twelve o ’ clock .
During all this time a sentinel , who had been relieved at eight o ’ clock , had been watching his door .
<unk> Danglars suddenly felt a strong inclination to see the person who kept watch over him .
He had noticed that a few rays , not of daylight , but from a lamp , penetrated through the <unk> planks of the door ; he approached just as the <unk> was <unk> himself with a <unk> of brandy , which , owing to the <unk> bottle containing it , sent forth an odor which was extremely unpleasant to Danglars .
“ <unk> ! ” he exclaimed , retreating to the farther corner of his cell .
At twelve this man was replaced by another <unk> , and Danglars , wishing to catch sight of his new <unk> , approached the door again .
He was an <unk> , gigantic bandit , with large eyes , thick lips , and a flat nose ; his red hair fell in <unk> masses like <unk> around his shoulders .
“ Ah , <unk> , ” cried Danglars , “ this fellow is more like an <unk> than anything else ; however , I am rather too old and <unk> to be very good eating ! ” We see that Danglars was collected enough to jest ; at the same time , as though to <unk> the <unk> <unk> , the man took some black bread , <unk> , and <unk> from his <unk> , which he began <unk> <unk> .
“ May I be <unk> , ” said Danglars , glancing at the bandit ’ s dinner through the <unk> of the door , — “ may I be <unk> if I can understand how people can eat such <unk> ! ” and he withdrew to seat himself upon his <unk> , which reminded him of the smell of the brandy .
But the mysteries of nature are <unk> , and there are certain <unk> contained in even the <unk> food which appeal very <unk> to a <unk> stomach .
Danglars felt his own not to be very well supplied just then , and gradually the man appeared less ugly , the bread less black , and the <unk> more fresh , while those dreadful vulgar <unk> recalled to his mind certain <unk> and <unk> , which his <unk> prepared in a very superior manner whenever he said , “ Monsieur <unk> , let me have a nice little <unk> today . ” He got up and knocked on the door ; the bandit raised his head .
Danglars knew that he was heard , so he redoubled his blows .
“ _ <unk> <unk> ? _ ” asked the bandit .
“ Come , come , ” said Danglars , <unk> his fingers against the door , “ I think it is quite time to think of giving me something to eat ! ” But whether he did not understand him , or whether he had received no orders respecting the <unk> of Danglars , the <unk> , without answering , went on with his dinner .
Danglars ’ feelings were hurt , and not wishing to put himself under <unk> to the brute , the banker threw himself down again on his <unk> and did not breathe another word .
Four hours passed by and the <unk> was replaced by another bandit .
Danglars , who really began to experience <unk> <unk> at the stomach , arose softly , again applied his eye to the <unk> of the door , and recognized the intelligent countenance of his guide .
It was , indeed , Peppino who was preparing to <unk> guard as <unk> as possible by <unk> himself opposite to the door , and placing between his legs an <unk> <unk> , containing <unk> <unk> with <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> he also placed a pretty little basket of <unk> <unk> and a <unk> of <unk> .
Peppino was decidedly an <unk> .
Danglars watched these <unk> and his mouth <unk> .
“ Come , ” he said to himself , “ let me try if he will be more <unk> than the other ; ” and he <unk> gently at the door .
“ _ On <unk> <unk> _ , ” ( coming ) exclaimed Peppino , who from <unk> the house of Signor Pastrini understood French perfectly in all its <unk> .
Danglars immediately recognized him as the man who had called out in such a furious manner , “ <unk> in your head ! ” But this was not the time for <unk> , so he assumed his most agreeable manner and said with a gracious smile : “ Excuse me , sir , but are they not going to give me any dinner ? ” “ Does your excellency happen to be hungry ? ” “ <unk> to be hungry , — that ’ s pretty good , when I <unk> ’ t eaten for <unk> hours ! ” muttered Danglars .
Then he added aloud , “ Yes , sir , I am hungry — very hungry . ” “ And your excellency wants something to eat ? ” “ At once , if possible ” “ Nothing <unk> , ” said Peppino .
“ Here you can get anything you want ; by paying for it , of course , as among honest <unk> . ” “ Of course ! ” cried Danglars .
“ Although , in justice , the people who arrest and <unk> you , ought , at least , to <unk> you . ” “ That is not the custom , excellency , ” said Peppino .
“ A bad reason , ” replied Danglars , who <unk> on <unk> his <unk> ; “ but I am content .
Let me have some dinner ! ” “ At once !
What would your excellency like ? ” And Peppino placed his <unk> on the ground , so that the <unk> rose directly under the <unk> of Danglars .
“ Give your orders . ” “ Have you <unk> here ? ” “ <unk> ? — of course — complete ones . ” “ And <unk> ? ” “ <unk> ! ” “ Well , a fowl , fish , game , — it <unk> little , so that I eat . ” “ As your excellency pleases .
You mentioned a fowl , I think ? ” “ Yes , a fowl . ” Peppino , turning around , shouted , “ A fowl for his excellency ! ” His voice yet <unk> in the <unk> when a handsome , graceful , and <unk> young man appeared , bearing a fowl in a silver <unk> on his head , without the assistance of his hands .
“ I could almost believe myself at the Café de Paris , ” murmured Danglars .
“ Here , your excellency , ” said Peppino , taking the fowl from the young bandit and placing it on the <unk> table , which with the <unk> and the <unk> bed formed the entire furniture of the cell .
Danglars asked for a knife and <unk> .
“ Here , excellency , ” said Peppino , offering him a little <unk> knife and a <unk> <unk> .
Danglars took the knife in one hand and the <unk> in the other , and was about to cut up the fowl .
“ Pardon me , excellency , ” said Peppino , placing his hand on the banker ’ s shoulder ; “ people pay here before they eat .
They might not be satisfied , and — — ” “ Ah , <unk> , ” thought Danglars , “ this is not so much like Paris , except that I shall probably be <unk> !
Never mind , I ’ ll fix that all right .
I have always heard how <unk> <unk> is in Italy ; I should think a fowl is worth about twelve sous at Rome . — There , ” he said , throwing a louis down .
Peppino picked up the louis , and Danglars again prepared to <unk> the fowl .
“ Stay a moment , your excellency , ” said Peppino , rising ; “ you still owe me something . ” “ I said they would skin me , ” thought Danglars ; but <unk> to resist the <unk> , he said , “ Come , how much do I owe you for this fowl ? ” “ Your excellency has given me a louis on account . ” “ A louis on account for a fowl ? ” “ Certainly ; and your excellency now <unk> me <unk> louis . ” Danglars opened his enormous eyes on hearing this gigantic joke .
“ Very <unk> , ” he muttered , “ very <unk> indeed , ” and he again began to <unk> the fowl , when Peppino stopped the baron ’ s right hand with his left , and held out his other hand .
“ Come , now , ” he said .
“ Is it not a joke ? ” said Danglars .
“ We never joke , ” replied Peppino , solemn as a <unk> .
“ What !
A hundred thousand francs for a fowl ! ” “ Ah , excellency , you cannot imagine how hard it is to rear <unk> in these horrible <unk> ! ” “ Come , come , this is very <unk> — very amusing — I allow ; but , as I am very hungry , pray allow me to eat .
Stay , here is another louis for you . ” “ Then that will make only <unk> louis more , ” said Peppino with the same indifference .
“ I shall get them all in time . ” “ Oh , as for that , ” said Danglars , angry at this <unk> of the jest , — “ as for that you won ’ t get them at all .
Go to the devil !
You do not know with whom you have to deal ! ” <unk> Peppino made a sign , and the youth hastily removed the fowl .
Danglars threw himself upon his <unk> , and Peppino , <unk> the door , again began eating his <unk> and <unk> .
Though Danglars could not see Peppino , the noise of his teeth allowed no doubt as to his occupation .
He was certainly eating , and <unk> too , like an <unk> man .
“ <unk> ! ” said Danglars .
Peppino pretended not to hear him , and without even turning his head continued to eat slowly .
Danglars ’ stomach felt so empty , that it seemed as if it would be impossible ever to fill it again ; still he had patience for another <unk> , which appeared to him like a century .
He again arose and went to the door .
“ Come , sir , do not keep me <unk> here any longer , but tell me what they want . ” “ Nay , your excellency , it is you who should tell us what you want .
Give your orders , and we will <unk> them . ” “ Then open the door directly . ” Peppino obeyed .
“ Now look here , I want something to eat !
To eat — do you hear ? ” “ Are you hungry ? ” “ Come , you understand me . ” “ What would your excellency like to eat ? ” “ A piece of dry bread , since the <unk> are beyond all price in this <unk> place . ” “ <unk> ?
Very well .
<unk> , there , some bread ! ” he called .
The youth brought a small <unk> .
“ How much ? ” asked Danglars .
“ Four thousand nine hundred and <unk> louis , ” said Peppino ; “ You have paid two louis in advance . ” <unk> “ What ?
One hundred thousand francs for a <unk> ? ” “ One hundred thousand francs , ” repeated Peppino .
“ But you only asked <unk> francs for a fowl ! ” “ We have a fixed price for all our provisions .
It <unk> nothing whether you eat much or little — whether you have ten <unk> or one — it is always the same price . ” “ What , still keeping up this silly jest ?
My dear fellow , it is perfectly ridiculous — stupid !
You had better tell me at once that you intend <unk> me to death . ” “ Oh , dear , no , your excellency , unless you intend to commit suicide .
<unk> and eat . ” “ And what am I to pay with , brute ? ” said Danglars , <unk> .
“ Do you suppose I carry <unk> francs in my pocket ? ” “ Your excellency has <unk> francs in your pocket ; that will be fifty <unk> at <unk> francs <unk> , and half a fowl for the <unk> . ” Danglars shuddered .
The <unk> fell from his eyes , and he understood the joke , which he did not think quite so stupid as he had done just before .
“ Come , ” he said , “ if I pay you the <unk> francs , will you be satisfied , and allow me to eat at my ease ? ” “ Certainly , ” said Peppino .
“ But how can I pay them ? ” “ Oh , nothing <unk> ; you have an account open with <unk> Thomson &amp; French , <unk> <unk> <unk> , Rome ; give me a <unk> for <unk> louis on these gentlemen , and our banker shall take it . ” Danglars thought it as well to comply with a good grace , so he took the pen , ink , and paper Peppino offered him , wrote the <unk> , and signed it .
“ Here , ” he said , “ here is a <unk> at sight . ” “ And here is your fowl . ” Danglars sighed while he <unk> the fowl ; it appeared very thin for the price it had cost .
As for Peppino , he examined the paper attentively , put it into his pocket , and continued eating his <unk> .
Chapter <unk> .
The Pardon The next day Danglars was again hungry ; certainly the air of that dungeon was very <unk> of appetite .
The prisoner expected that he would be at no expense that day , for like an <unk> man he had concealed half of his fowl and a piece of the bread in the corner of his cell .
But he had no sooner eaten than he felt <unk> ; he had forgotten that .
He struggled against his thirst till his tongue <unk> to the roof of his mouth ; then , no longer able to resist , he called out .
The sentinel opened the door ; it was a new face .
He thought it would be better to <unk> business with his old acquaintance , so he sent for Peppino .
“ Here I am , your excellency , ” said Peppino , with an eagerness which Danglars thought favorable to him .
“ What do you want ? ” “ Something to drink . ” “ Your excellency knows that wine is beyond all price near Rome . ” “ Then give me water , ” cried Danglars , endeavoring to <unk> the blow .
“ Oh , water is even more <unk> than wine , your excellency , — there has been such a <unk> . ” “ Come , ” thought Danglars , “ it is the same old story . ” And while he smiled as he attempted to regard the affair as a joke , he felt his <unk> get <unk> with perspiration .
“ Come , my friend , ” said Danglars , seeing that he made no impression on Peppino , “ you will not refuse me a glass of wine ? ” “ I have already told you that we do not sell at <unk> . ” “ Well , then , let me have a bottle of the least <unk> . ” “ They are all the same price . ” “ And what is that ? ” “ <unk> thousand francs a bottle . ” “ Tell me , ” cried Danglars , in a tone whose bitterness <unk> alone has been capable of <unk> — “ tell me that you wish to <unk> me of all ; it will be sooner over than <unk> me <unk> . ” “ It is possible such may be the master ’ s intention . ” “ The master ? — who is he ? ” “ The person to whom you were conducted yesterday . ” “ Where is he ? ” “ Here . ” “ Let me see him . ” “ Certainly . ” And the next moment Luigi Vampa appeared before Danglars .
“ You sent for me ? ” he said to the prisoner .
“ Are you , sir , the chief of the people who brought me here ? ” “ Yes , your excellency .
What then ? ” “ How much do you require for my <unk> ? ” “ <unk> the <unk> you have about you . ” Danglars felt a dreadful <unk> <unk> through his heart .
“ But this is all I have left in the world , ” he said , “ out of an immense fortune .
If you <unk> me of that , take away my life also . ” “ We are forbidden to shed your blood . ” “ And by whom are you forbidden ? ” “ By him we obey . ” “ You do , then , obey someone ? ” “ Yes , a chief . ” “ I thought you said you were the chief ? ” “ So I am of these men ; but there is another over me . ” “ And did your superior order you to treat me in this way ? ” “ Yes . ” “ But my purse will be exhausted . ” “ <unk> . ” “ Come , ” said Danglars , “ will you take a million ? ” “ No . ” “ Two millions ? — three ? — four ?
Come , four ?
I will give them to you on condition that you let me go . ” “ Why do you offer me <unk> for what is worth <unk> ?
This is a kind of <unk> , banker , that I do not understand . ” “ Take all , then — take all , I tell you , and kill me ! ” “ Come , come , calm yourself .
You will excite your blood , and that would produce an appetite it would require a million a day to satisfy .
Be more <unk> . ” “ But when I have no more money left to pay you ? ” asked the <unk> Danglars .
“ Then you must suffer hunger . ” “ <unk> hunger ? ” said Danglars , becoming pale .
“ Most likely , ” replied Vampa <unk> .
“ But you say you do not wish to kill me ? ” “ No . ” “ And yet you will let me <unk> with hunger ? ” “ Ah , that is a different thing . ” “ Well , then , <unk> , ” cried Danglars , “ I will <unk> your infamous <unk> — I would rather die at once !
You may torture , <unk> , kill me , but you shall not have my signature again ! ” “ As your excellency pleases , ” said Vampa , as he left the cell .
Danglars , <unk> , threw himself on the <unk> .
Who could these men be ?
Who was the invisible chief ?
What could be his intentions towards him ?
And why , when everyone else was allowed to be <unk> , might he not also be ?
Oh , yes ; certainly a <unk> , violent death would be a fine means of <unk> these <unk> enemies , who appeared to pursue him with such <unk> vengeance .
But to die ?
For the first time in his life , Danglars contemplated death with a mixture of dread and desire ; the time had come when the <unk> spectre , which exists in the mind of every human creature , arrested his attention and called out with every <unk> of his heart , “ Thou <unk> die ! ” Danglars resembled a timid animal excited in the <unk> ; first it flies , then <unk> , and at last , by the very force of <unk> , sometimes <unk> in <unk> its <unk> .
Danglars meditated an escape ; but the walls were solid rock , a man was sitting reading at the only <unk> to the cell , and behind that man <unk> armed with guns continually passed .
His resolution not to sign lasted two days , after which he offered a million for some food .
They sent him a magnificent supper , and took his million .
From this time the prisoner resolved to suffer no longer , but to have everything he wanted .
At the end of twelve days , after having made a splendid dinner , he <unk> his accounts , and found that he had only <unk> francs left .
Then a strange <unk> took place ; he who had just abandoned <unk> endeavored to save the <unk> francs he had left , and sooner than give them up he resolved to enter again upon a life of <unk> — he was <unk> by the <unk> that is a <unk> of madness .
He , who for so long a time had forgotten God , began to think that <unk> were possible — that the <unk> cavern might be discovered by the officers of the <unk> States , who would <unk> him ; that then he would have <unk> remaining , which would be sufficient to save him from <unk> ; and finally he <unk> that this sum might be preserved to him , and as he <unk> he wept .
Three days passed thus , during which his prayers were frequent , if not <unk> .
Sometimes he was <unk> , and fancied he saw an old man stretched on a <unk> ; he , also , was dying of hunger .
On the fourth , he was no longer a man , but a living corpse .
He had picked up every <unk> that had been left from his former <unk> , and was beginning to eat the <unk> which covered the floor of his cell .
Then he <unk> Peppino , as he would a <unk> angel , to give him food ; he offered him <unk> francs for a <unk> of bread .
But Peppino did not answer .
On the fifth day he dragged himself to the door of the cell .
“ Are you not a Christian ? ” he said , falling on his knees .
“ Do you wish to <unk> a man who , in the eyes of Heaven , is a brother ?
Oh , my former friends , my former friends ! ” he murmured , and fell with his face to the ground .
Then rising in despair , he exclaimed , “ The chief , the chief ! ” “ Here I am , ” said Vampa , instantly appearing ; “ what do you want ? ” “ Take my last gold , ” muttered Danglars , holding out his pocket-book , “ and let me live here ; I ask no more for liberty — I only ask to live ! ” “ Then you suffer a great deal ? ” “ Oh , yes , yes , <unk> ! ” “ Still , there have been men who suffered more than you . ” “ I do not think so . ” “ Yes ; those who have died of hunger . ” Danglars thought of the old man whom , in his hours of delirium , he had seen <unk> on his bed .
He struck his forehead on the ground and <unk> .
“ Yes , ” he said , “ there have been some who have suffered more than I have , but then they must have been <unk> at least . ” “ Do you <unk> ? ” asked a deep , solemn voice , which caused Danglars ’ hair to stand on end .
His feeble eyes endeavored to distinguish objects , and behind the bandit he saw a man enveloped in a cloak , half lost in the shadow of a stone column .
“ Of what must I <unk> ? ” stammered Danglars .
“ Of the evil you have done , ” said the voice .
“ Oh , yes ; oh , yes , I do indeed <unk> . ” And he struck his breast with his <unk> fist .
“ Then I forgive you , ” said the man , <unk> his cloak , and advancing to the light .
“ The Count of Monte Cristo ! ” said Danglars , more pale from terror than he had been just before from hunger and misery .
“ You are mistaken — I am not the Count of Monte Cristo . ” “ Then who are you ? ” <unk> “ I am he whom you sold and <unk> — I am he whose betrothed you <unk> — I am he upon whom you <unk> that you might raise yourself to fortune — I am he whose father you condemned to die of hunger — I am he whom you also condemned to <unk> , and who yet <unk> you , because he hopes to be <unk> — I am Edmond Dantès ! ” Danglars uttered a cry , and fell <unk> .
“ <unk> , ” said the count , “ your life is safe ; the same good fortune has not happened to your <unk> — one is mad , the other dead .
<unk> the <unk> francs you have left — I give them to you .
The <unk> you stole from the <unk> has been restored to them by an unknown hand .
And now eat and drink ; I will entertain you tonight .
Vampa , when this man is satisfied , let him be free . ” Danglars remained <unk> while the count withdrew ; when he raised his head he saw <unk> down the passage nothing but a shadow , before which the bandits bowed .
<unk> to the count ’ s directions , Danglars was waited on by Vampa , who brought him the best wine and <unk> of Italy ; then , having conducted him to the road , and pointed to the <unk> , left him leaning against a tree .
He remained there all night , not knowing where he was .
When daylight <unk> he saw that he was near a stream ; he was <unk> , and dragged himself towards it .
As he <unk> down to drink , he saw that his hair had become entirely white .
Chapter <unk> .
The <unk> of October It was about six o ’ clock in the evening ; an <unk> light , through which an <unk> sun shed its golden rays , descended on the blue ocean .
The heat of the day had gradually <unk> , and a light breeze arose , seeming like the <unk> of nature on <unk> from the burning <unk> of the south .
A <unk> <unk> played along the <unk> of the <unk> , and <unk> from shore to shore the sweet perfume of plants , mingled with the fresh smell of the sea .
A light yacht , <unk> and elegant in its form , was <unk> <unk> the first <unk> of night over the immense lake , extending from <unk> to the <unk> , and from <unk> to <unk> .
The vessel resembled a <unk> with its wings opened towards the wind , <unk> on the water .
It advanced <unk> and <unk> , leaving behind it a <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
By degrees the sun disappeared behind the <unk> horizon ; but as though to prove the truth of the <unk> ideas in <unk> <unk> , its <unk> rays reappeared on the summit of every wave , as if the <unk> of fire had just sunk upon the bosom of <unk> , who in vain endeavored to hide her lover beneath her azure mantle .
The yacht moved rapidly on , though there did not appear to be sufficient wind to <unk> the <unk> on the head of a young girl .
<unk> on the <unk> was a tall man , of a dark complexion , who saw with <unk> eyes that they were approaching a dark mass of land in the shape of a <unk> , which rose from the midst of the waves like the hat of a <unk> .
“ Is that Monte Cristo ? ” asked the traveller , to whose orders the yacht was for the time <unk> , in a melancholy voice .
“ Yes , your excellency , ” said the captain , “ we have reached it . ” “ We have reached it ! ” repeated the traveller in an accent of indescribable sadness .
Then he added , in a low tone , “ Yes ; that is the <unk> . ” And then he again plunged into a train of thought , the character of which was better revealed by a sad smile , than it would have been by tears .
A few minutes afterwards a flash of light , which was extinguished instantly , was seen on the land , and the sound of <unk> reached the yacht .
“ Your excellency , ” said the captain , “ that was the land signal , will you answer yourself ? ” “ What signal ? ” The captain pointed towards the island , up the side of which ascended a volume of smoke , increasing as it rose .
“ Ah , yes , ” he said , as if <unk> from a dream .
“ Give it to me . ” The captain gave him a loaded <unk> ; the traveller slowly raised it , and fired in the air .
Ten minutes afterwards , the sails were <unk> , and they cast anchor about a hundred <unk> from the little <unk> .
The <unk> was already lowered , and in it were four <unk> and a <unk> .
The traveller descended , and instead of sitting down at the stern of the boat , which had been <unk> with a blue <unk> for his <unk> , stood up with his arms crossed .
The <unk> waited , their <unk> half lifted out of the water , like birds <unk> their wings .
<unk> “ Give way , ” said the traveller .
The eight <unk> fell into the sea <unk> without <unk> a drop of water , and the boat , <unk> to the <unk> , <unk> forward .
In an instant they found themselves in a little <unk> , formed in a natural <unk> ; the boat <unk> on the fine sand .
“ Will your excellency be so good as to <unk> the shoulders of two of our men , they will carry you <unk> ? ” The young man answered this invitation with a gesture of indifference , and stepped out of the boat ; the sea immediately rose to his waist .
“ Ah , your excellency , ” murmured the <unk> , “ you should not have done so ; our master will <unk> us for it . ” The young man continued to advance , following the sailors , who chose a firm <unk> .
<unk> <unk> brought them to dry land ; the young man stamped on the ground to shake off the wet , and looked around for someone to show him his road , for it was quite dark .
Just as he turned , a hand rested on his shoulder , and a voice which made him shudder exclaimed : “ <unk> , Maximilian ; you are <unk> , thank you ! ” “ Ah , is it you , count ? ” said the young man , in an almost <unk> accent , pressing Monte Cristo ’ s hand with both his own .
“ Yes ; you see I am as exact as you are .
But you are <unk> , my dear fellow ; you must change your clothes , as <unk> said to <unk> .
Come , I have a <unk> prepared for you in which you will soon forget fatigue and cold . ” Monte Cristo perceived that the young man had turned around ; indeed , Morrel saw with surprise that the men who had brought him had left without being paid , or uttering a word .
<unk> the sound of their <unk> might be heard as they returned to the yacht .
“ Oh , yes , ” said the count , “ you are looking for the sailors . ” “ Yes , I paid them nothing , and yet they are gone . ” “ Never mind that , Maximilian , ” said Monte Cristo , smiling .
“ I have made an agreement with the <unk> , that the access to my island shall be free of all charge .
I have made a <unk> . ” Morrel looked at the count with surprise .
“ Count , ” he said , “ you are not the same here as in Paris . ” “ How so ? ” “ Here you laugh . ” The count ’ s brow became <unk> .
“ You are right to recall me to myself , Maximilian , ” he said ; “ I was delighted to see you again , and forgot for the moment that all happiness is <unk> . ” “ Oh , no , no , count , ” cried Maximilian , seizing the count ’ s hands , “ pray laugh ; be happy , and prove to me , by your indifference , that life is <unk> to <unk> .
Oh , how charitable , kind , and good you are ; you affect this gayety to inspire me with courage . ” “ You are wrong , Morrel ; I was really happy . ” “ Then you forget me , so much the better . ” “ How so ? ” “ Yes ; for as the <unk> said to the emperor , when he entered the <unk> , ‘ He who is about to die <unk> you . ’ ” “ Then you are not <unk> ? ” asked the count , surprised .
“ Oh , ” exclaimed Morrel , with a glance full of bitter reproach , “ do you think it possible that I could be ? ” “ Listen , ” said the count .
“ Do you understand the meaning of my words ?
You cannot take me for a <unk> man , a mere <unk> , <unk> a vague and <unk> noise .
When I ask you if you are <unk> , I speak to you as a man for whom the human heart has no secrets .
Well , Morrel , let us both examine the depths of your heart .
Do you still feel the same feverish impatience of grief which made you start like a wounded lion ?
Have you still that <unk> thirst which can only be <unk> in the grave ?
Are you still <unk> by the regret which <unk> the living to the pursuit of death ; or are you only suffering from the <unk> of fatigue and the <unk> of hope <unk> ?
Has the loss of memory rendered it impossible for you to weep ?
Oh , my dear friend , if this be the case , — if you can no longer weep , if your <unk> heart be dead , if you put all your trust in God , then , Maximilian , you are <unk> — do not complain . ” “ Count , ” said Morrel , in a firm and at the same time soft voice , “ listen to me , as to a man whose thoughts are raised to heaven , though he remains on earth ; I come to die in the arms of a friend .
Certainly , there are people whom I love .
I love my sister Julie , — I love her husband Emmanuel ; but I require a strong mind to smile on my last moments .
My sister would be bathed in tears and <unk> ; I could not bear to see her suffer .
Emmanuel would tear the weapon from my hand , and alarm the house with his cries .
You , count , who are more than mortal , will , I am sure , lead me to death by a pleasant path , will you not ? ” <unk> “ My friend , ” said the count , “ I have still one doubt , — are you weak enough to pride yourself upon your sufferings ? ” “ No , indeed , — I am calm , ” said Morrel , giving his hand to the count ; “ my pulse does not beat <unk> or <unk> than usual .
No , I feel that I have reached the <unk> , and I will go no farther .
You told me to wait and hope ; do you know what you did , unfortunate <unk> ?
I waited a month , or rather I suffered for a month !
I did hope ( man is a poor wretched creature ) , I did hope .
What I cannot tell , — something wonderful , an <unk> , a miracle , — of what nature he alone can tell who has mingled with our reason that folly we call hope .
Yes , I did wait — yes , I did hope , count , and during this quarter of an hour we have been talking together , you have unconsciously wounded , <unk> my heart , for every word you have uttered proved that there was no hope for me .
Oh , count , I shall sleep calmly , <unk> in the arms of death . ” Morrel uttered these words with an energy which made the count shudder .
“ My friend , ” continued Morrel , “ you named the fifth of October as the end of the period of waiting , — today is the fifth of October , ” he took out his watch , “ it is now nine o ’ clock , — I have yet three hours to live . ” “ Be it so , ” said the count , “ come . ” Morrel mechanically followed the count , and they had entered the grotto before he perceived it .
He felt a <unk> under his feet , a door opened , <unk> surrounded him , and a brilliant light dazzled his eyes .
Morrel hesitated to advance ; he dreaded the <unk> effect of all that he saw .
Monte Cristo drew him in gently .
“ Why should we not spend the last three hours remaining to us of life , like those ancient <unk> , who when condemned by <unk> , their emperor and heir , sat down at a table covered with flowers , and gently <unk> into death , amid the perfume of <unk> and roses ? ” Morrel smiled .
“ As you please , ” he said ; “ death is always death , — that is forgetfulness , repose , <unk> from life , and therefore from grief . ” He sat down , and Monte Cristo placed himself opposite to him .
They were in the marvellous dining-room before described , where the <unk> had <unk> on their heads always filled with <unk> and flowers .
Morrel had looked <unk> around , and had probably noticed nothing .
“ Let us talk like men , ” he said , looking at the count .
“ Go on ! ” “ Count , ” said Morrel , “ you are the <unk> of all human knowledge , and you seem like a being descended from a <unk> and more advanced world than ours . ” “ There is something true in what you say , ” said the count , with that smile which made him so handsome ; “ I have descended from a <unk> called grief . ” <unk> “ I believe all you tell me without <unk> its meaning ; for instance , you told me to live , and I did live ; you told me to hope , and I almost did so .
I am almost inclined to ask you , as though you had experienced death , ‘ is it painful to die ? ’ ” Monte Cristo looked upon Morrel with indescribable tenderness .
“ Yes , ” he said , “ yes , doubtless it is painful , if you violently break the outer <unk> which <unk> <unk> for life .
If you <unk> a <unk> into your flesh , if you <unk> a bullet into your brain , which the least shock <unk> , — then certainly , you will suffer pain , and you will <unk> quitting a life for a repose you have bought at so dear a price . ” “ Yes ; I know that there is a secret of luxury and pain in death , as well as in life ; the only thing is to understand it . ” “ You have spoken truly , Maximilian ; according to the care we bestow upon it , death is either a friend who rocks us gently as a nurse , or an enemy who violently <unk> the soul from the body .
Some day , when the world is much older , and when mankind will be masters of all the <unk> powers in nature , to serve for the general good of humanity ; when mankind , as you were just saying , have discovered the secrets of death , then that death will become as sweet and <unk> as a slumber in the arms of your beloved . ” “ And if you wished to die , you would choose this death , count ? ” “ Yes . ” Morrel extended his hand .
“ Now I understand , ” he said , “ why you had me brought here to this <unk> spot , in the midst of the ocean , to this subterranean palace ; it was because you loved me , was it not , count ?
It was because you loved me well enough to give me one of those sweet means of death of which we were speaking ; a death without agony , a death which <unk> me to <unk> away while <unk> Valentine ’ s name and pressing your hand . ” “ Yes , you have guessed rightly , Morrel , ” said the count , “ that is what I intended . ” “ Thanks ; the idea that tomorrow I shall no longer suffer , is sweet to my heart . ” “ Do you then regret nothing ? ” “ No , ” replied Morrel .
“ Not even me ? ” asked the count with deep emotion .
Morrel ’ s clear eye was for the moment <unk> , then it shone with unusual <unk> , and a large tear rolled down his cheek .
“ What , ” said the count , “ do you still regret anything in the world , and yet die ? ” “ Oh , I entreat you , ” exclaimed Morrel in a low voice , “ do not speak another word , count ; do not <unk> my punishment . ” The count fancied that he was <unk> , and this belief <unk> the horrible doubt that had overwhelmed him at the Château d ’ If .
“ I am endeavoring , ” he thought , “ to make this man happy ; I look upon this <unk> as a weight thrown into the scale to balance the evil I have <unk> .
Now , supposing I am deceived , supposing this man has not been unhappy enough to merit happiness .
Alas , what would become of me who can only <unk> for evil by doing good ? ” <unk> Then he said aloud : “ Listen , Morrel , I see your grief is great , but still you do not like to risk your soul . ” Morrel smiled sadly .
“ Count , ” he said , “ I swear to you my soul is no longer my own . ” “ Maximilian , you know I have no relation in the world .
I have accustomed myself to regard you as my son : well , then , to save my son , I will sacrifice my life , nay , even my fortune . ” “ What do you mean ? ” “ I mean , that you wish to quit life because you do not understand all the <unk> which are the <unk> of a large fortune .
Morrel , I possess nearly a hundred millions and I give them to you ; with such a fortune you can <unk> every wish .
Are you <unk> ?
Every career is open to you .
<unk> the world , change its character , yield to mad ideas , be even criminal — but live . ” “ Count , I have your word , ” said Morrel coldly ; then taking out his watch , he added , “ It is half-past eleven . ” “ Morrel , can you intend it in my house , under my very eyes ? ” “ Then let me go , ” said Maximilian , “ or I shall think you did not love me for my own sake , but for yours ; ” and he arose .
“ It is well , ” said Monte Cristo whose countenance <unk> at these words ; “ you wish it — you are <unk> .
Yes , as you said , you are indeed wretched and a miracle alone can cure you .
<unk> down , Morrel , and wait . ” Morrel obeyed ; the count arose , and <unk> a <unk> with a key suspended from his gold chain , took from it a little silver <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> , the corners of which represented four bending figures , similar to the <unk> , the forms of women , <unk> of the angels <unk> to heaven .
He placed the <unk> on the table ; then opening it took out a little golden box , the top of which flew open when touched by a secret spring .
This box contained an <unk> substance partly solid , of which it was impossible to discover the color , owing to the reflection of the polished gold , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , which ornamented the box .
It was a mixed mass of blue , red , and gold .
The count took out a small quantity of this with a <unk> <unk> , and offered it to Morrel , fixing a long <unk> glance upon him .
It was then <unk> that the substance was <unk> .
“ This is what you asked for , ” he said , “ and what I promised to give you . ” “ I thank you from the depths of my heart , ” said the young man , taking the <unk> from the hands of Monte Cristo .
The count took another <unk> , and again <unk> it into the golden box .
“ What are you going to do , my friend ? ” asked Morrel , <unk> his hand .
“ Well , the fact is , Morrel , I was thinking that I too am weary of life , and since an opportunity presents itself — — ” “ Stay ! ” said the young man .
“ You who love , and are beloved ; you , who have faith and hope , — oh , do not follow my example .
In your case it would be a crime .
Adieu , my noble and generous friend , adieu ; I will go and tell Valentine what you have done for me . ” And slowly , though without any hesitation , only waiting to press the count ’ s hand <unk> , he swallowed the mysterious substance offered by Monte Cristo .
Then they were both silent .
Ali , mute and attentive , brought the <unk> and coffee , and disappeared .
By degrees , the light of the lamps gradually <unk> in the hands of the marble <unk> which held them , and the <unk> appeared less powerful to Morrel .
<unk> opposite to him , Monte Cristo watched him in the shadow , and Morrel saw nothing but the bright eyes of the count .
An <unk> sadness took possession of the young man , his hands <unk> their hold , the objects in the room gradually lost their form and color , and his disturbed vision seemed to perceive doors and curtains open in the wall .
<unk> “ <unk> , ” he cried , “ I feel that I am dying ; thanks ! ” He made a last effort to <unk> his hand , but it fell <unk> beside him .
Then it appeared to him that Monte Cristo smiled , not with the strange and fearful expression which had sometimes revealed to him the secrets of his heart , but with the benevolent kindness of a father for a child .
At the same time the count appeared to increase in stature , his form , nearly double its usual height , stood out in relief against the red <unk> , his black hair was thrown back , and he stood in the attitude of an <unk> angel .
Morrel , <unk> , turned around in the armchair ; a <unk> <unk> <unk> every <unk> .
A change of ideas presented themselves to his brain , like a new design on the <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> , and breathless , he became unconscious of <unk> objects ; he seemed to be entering that vague delirium preceding death .
He wished once again to press the count ’ s hand , but his own was <unk> .
He wished to <unk> a last farewell , but his tongue lay motionless and heavy in his throat , like a stone at the mouth of a sepulchre .
<unk> his <unk> eyes closed , and still through his <unk> a <unk> form seemed to move amid the obscurity with which he thought himself enveloped .
The count had just opened a door .
<unk> a brilliant light from the next room , or rather from the palace adjoining , shone upon the room in which he was gently <unk> into his last sleep .
Then he saw a woman of marvellous beauty appear on the threshold of the door <unk> the two rooms .
<unk> , and <unk> smiling , she looked like an angel of mercy <unk> the angel of vengeance .
“ Is it heaven that opens before me ? ” thought the dying man ; “ that angel resembles the one I have lost . ” Monte Cristo pointed out Morrel to the young woman , who advanced towards him with clasped hands and a smile upon her lips .
“ Valentine , Valentine ! ” he <unk> ejaculated ; but his lips uttered no sound , and as though all his strength were <unk> in that <unk> emotion , he sighed and closed his eyes .
Valentine rushed towards him ; his lips again moved .
“ He is calling you , ” said the count ; “ he to whom you have <unk> your destiny — he from whom death would have separated you , calls you to him .
<unk> , I <unk> death .
<unk> , Valentine , you will never again be separated on earth , since he has rushed into death to find you .
Without me , you would both have died .
May God accept my <unk> in the <unk> of these two <unk> ! ” Valentine seized the count ’ s hand , and in her irresistible impulse of joy carried it to her lips .
<unk> “ Oh , thank me again ! ” said the count ; “ tell me till you are weary , that I have restored you to happiness ; you do not know how much I require this assurance . ” “ Oh , yes , yes , I thank you with all my heart , ” said Valentine ; “ and if you doubt the sincerity of my gratitude , oh , then , ask Haydée !
ask my beloved sister Haydée , who ever since our departure from France , has caused me to wait <unk> for this happy day , while talking to me of you . ” “ You then love Haydée ? ” asked Monte Cristo with an emotion he in vain endeavored to <unk> .
“ Oh , yes , with all my soul . ” “ Well , then , listen , Valentine , ” said the count ; “ I have a favor to ask of you . ” “ Of me ?
Oh , am I happy enough for that ? ” “ Yes ; you have called Haydée your sister , — let her become so indeed , Valentine ; render her all the gratitude you fancy that you owe to me ; protect her , for ” ( the count ’ s voice was thick with emotion ) “ henceforth she will be alone in the world . ” “ <unk> in the world ! ” repeated a voice behind the count , “ and why ? ” Monte Cristo turned around ; Haydée was standing pale , motionless , looking at the count with an expression of fearful amazement .
“ Because tomorrow , Haydée , you will be free ; you will then assume your proper position in society , for I will not allow my destiny to <unk> yours .
<unk> of a prince , I restore to you the riches and name of your father . ” Haydée became pale , and <unk> her <unk> hands to heaven , exclaimed in a voice stifled with tears , “ Then you leave me , my lord ? ” “ Haydée , Haydée , you are young and beautiful ; forget even my name , and be happy . ” “ It is well , ” said Haydée ; “ your order shall be executed , my lord ; I will forget even your name , and be happy . ” And she stepped back to retire .
“ Oh , heavens , ” exclaimed Valentine , who was <unk> the head of Morrel on her shoulder , “ do you not see how pale she is ?
Do you not see how she <unk> ? ” Haydée answered with a <unk> expression , “ Why should he understand this , my sister ?
He is my master , and I am his slave ; he has the right to notice nothing . ” The count shuddered at the tones of a voice which penetrated the <unk> <unk> of his heart ; his eyes met those of the young girl and he could not bear their <unk> .
“ Oh , heavens , ” exclaimed Monte Cristo , “ can my suspicions be correct ?
Haydée , would it please you not to leave me ? ” “ I am young , ” gently replied Haydée ; “ I love the life you have made so sweet to me , and I should be sorry to die . ” “ You mean , then , that if I leave you , Haydée — — ” “ I should die ; yes , my lord . ” “ Do you then love me ? ” “ Oh , Valentine , he <unk> if I love him .
Valentine , tell him if you love Maximilian . ” The count felt his heart <unk> and <unk> ; he opened his arms , and Haydée , uttering a cry , sprang into them .
“ Oh , yes , ” she cried , “ I do love you !
I love you as one loves a father , brother , husband !
I love you as my life , for you are the best , the <unk> of created beings ! ” <unk> “ Let it be , then , as you wish , sweet angel ; God has sustained me in my struggle with my enemies , and has given me this <unk> ; he will not let me end my triumph in suffering ; I wished to <unk> myself , but he has <unk> me .
Love me then , Haydée !
Who knows ?
perhaps your love will make me forget all that I do not wish to remember . ” “ What do you mean , my lord ? ” “ I mean that one word from you has <unk> me more than twenty years of slow experience ; I have but you in the world , Haydée ; through you I again take hold on life , through you I shall suffer , through you rejoice . ” “ Do you hear him , Valentine ? ” exclaimed Haydée ; “ he says that through me he will suffer — through _ me _ , who would yield my life for his . ” The count withdrew for a moment .
“ Have I discovered the truth ? ” he said ; “ but whether it be for recompense or punishment , I accept my fate .
Come , Haydée , come ! ” and throwing his arm around the young girl ’ s waist , he pressed the hand of Valentine , and disappeared .
<unk> An hour had nearly passed , during which Valentine , breathless and motionless , watched <unk> over Morrel .
At length she felt his heart beat , a faint breath played upon his lips , a slight shudder , <unk> the return of life , passed through the young man ’ s frame .
At length his eyes opened , but they were at first fixed and <unk> ; then sight returned , and with it feeling and grief .
“ Oh , ” he cried , in an accent of despair , “ the count has deceived me ; I am yet living ; ” and extending his hand towards the table , he seized a knife .
“ <unk> , ” exclaimed Valentine , with her <unk> smile , “ awake , and look at me ! ” Morrel uttered a loud exclamation , and <unk> , doubtful , dazzled , as though by a celestial vision , he fell upon his knees .
The next morning at daybreak , Valentine and Morrel were walking <unk> on the <unk> , Valentine relating how Monte Cristo had appeared in her room , explained everything , revealed the crime , and , finally , how he had saved her life by <unk> her to <unk> death .
They had found the door of the grotto opened , and gone forth ; on the azure <unk> of heaven still <unk> a few remaining stars .
Morrel soon perceived a man standing among the rocks , apparently awaiting a sign from them to advance , and pointed him out to Valentine .
“ Ah , it is Jacopo , ” she said , “ the captain of the yacht ; ” and she <unk> him towards them .
“ Do you wish to speak to us ? ” asked Morrel .
“ I have a letter to give you from the count . ” “ From the count ! ” murmured the two young people .
“ Yes ; read it . ” <unk> Morrel opened the letter , and read : “ My Dear Maximilian , “ There is a <unk> for you at anchor .
Jacopo will carry you to Leghorn , where Monsieur Noirtier <unk> his <unk> , whom he wishes to bless before you lead her to the altar .
All that is in this grotto , my friend , my house in the Champs-Élysées , and my <unk> at <unk> , are the marriage <unk> bestowed by Edmond Dantès upon the son of his old master , Morrel .
Mademoiselle de Villefort will share them with you ; for I entreat her to give to the poor the immense fortune <unk> to her from her father , now a madman , and her brother who died last September with his mother .
Tell the angel who will watch over your future destiny , Morrel , to pray sometimes for a man , who , like <unk> , thought himself for an instant equal to God , but who now <unk> with Christian <unk> that God alone possesses supreme power and infinite wisdom .
Perhaps those prayers may <unk> the remorse he feels in his heart .
As for you , Morrel , this is the secret of my conduct towards you .
There is neither happiness nor misery in the world ; there is only the comparison of one state with another , nothing more .
He who has felt the <unk> grief is best able to experience supreme happiness .
We must have felt what it is to die , Morrel , that we may <unk> the <unk> of living .
“ <unk> , then , and be happy , beloved children of my heart , and never forget that until the day when God shall <unk> to reveal the future to man , all human wisdom is <unk> up in these two words , — ‘ _ Wait and hope _ . ’ — Your friend , “ Edmond Dantès , _ Count of Monte Cristo _ . ” <unk> During the <unk> of this letter , which informed Valentine for the first time of the madness of her father and the death of her brother , she became pale , a heavy sigh escaped from her bosom , and tears , not the less painful because they were silent , ran down her cheeks ; her happiness cost her very dear .
Morrel looked around <unk> .
“ But , ” he said , “ the count ’ s <unk> is too <unk> ; Valentine will be satisfied with my humble fortune .
Where is the count , friend ?
<unk> me to him . ” Jacopo pointed towards the horizon .
“ What do you mean ? ” asked Valentine .
“ Where is the count ? — where is Haydée ? ” “ Look ! ” said Jacopo .
The eyes of both were fixed upon the spot indicated by the sailor , and on the blue line <unk> the sky from the <unk> <unk> , they perceived a large white sail .
“ <unk> , ” said Morrel ; “ gone ! — adieu , my friend — adieu , my father ! ” “ <unk> , ” murmured Valentine ; “ adieu , my sweet Haydée — adieu , my sister ! ” “ Who can say whether we shall ever see them again ? ” said Morrel with <unk> eyes .
“ <unk> , ” replied Valentine , “ has not the count just told us that all human wisdom is <unk> up in two words : “ ‘ _ Wait and hope _ ( <unk> et <unk> ) ! ’ ” <unk> : &#91; 1 &#93; “ The wicked are great <unk> of water ; As the <unk> proved once for all . ” &#91; 2 &#93; <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
